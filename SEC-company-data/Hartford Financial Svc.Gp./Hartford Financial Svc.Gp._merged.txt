(together with its subsidiaries, the hartford , the company , we , or our ) is an insurance and financial services company. the hartford, headquartered in connecticut, is among the largest providers of property and casualty insurance and investment products to both individual and business customers in the united states of america. also, the hartford continues to manage life and annuity products previously sold. hartford fire insurance company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of the hartford's subsidiaries. at december 31, 2012 , total assets and total stockholders' equity of the hartford were $298.5 billion and $22.4 billion , respectively. organization the hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry. the company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to consumers and businesses. the company seeks on an ongoing basis to develop and expand its distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies of scale and improved technology, and capitalizes on its brand name and the hartford stag logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry. in 2012, the hartford concluded an evaluation of its strategy and business portfolio. the company is currently focusing on its property &amp; casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses. the objective of this realignment is to position the organization for higher returns on equity, reduced sensitivity to capital markets, a lower cost of capital and increased financial flexibility. as a result, the company completed the sales of its retirement plans and individual life businesses in january 2013 and in 2012, the company sold woodbury financial services, inc. ("woodbury financial services", "wfs") an indirect wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary, and placed its annuity businesses into runoff. as a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, the hartford financial services group, inc. has no significant business operations of its own. therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations. additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the hartford financial services group, inc. may be found in the capital resources and liquidity section of part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md&amp;a ). reporting segments the hartford currently conducts business principally in six reporting segments including property &amp; casualty commercial, consumer markets, property &amp; casualty other operations, group benefits, mutual funds and talcott resolution (formerly life other operations), as well as a corporate category. the hartford includes in its corporate category the company's debt financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities; and certain purchase accounting adjustments and other charges not allocated to the reporting segments. the following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of the hartford's reporting segments. for further discussion on the reporting segments, including financial disclosures of revenues by product line, geographical revenue, net income (loss), and assets for each reporting segment, see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements. 5 table of contents property &amp; casualty commercial principal products and services property &amp; casualty commercial provides workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability and umbrella coverages under several different products, primarily throughout the united states, within its standard commercial lines, which consists of the hartford's small commercial and middle market lines of business. additionally, a variety of customized insurance products and risk management services including workers' compensation, automobile, general liability, professional liability, livestock and specialty casualty coverages are offered through the segment's specialty lines. standard commercial lines seeks to offer products with coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder's individualized risk characteristics. for small businesses, those businesses whose annual payroll is under $5 and whose revenue and property values are less than $15 each, property and liability coverages are bundled as part of a single multi-peril package policy marketed under the spectrum name. medium-sized businesses, companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed the small business definition, are served within middle market. the middle market line of business provides workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella fidelity, surety and marine coverages. within the specialty lines, a significant portion of the specialty casualty business, including workers' compensation business, is written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides collateral to support loss payments made within their deductible. the specialty casualty business also provides retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. captive and specialty programs provide tailored property and casualty programs primarily to customers with common risk characteristics and those seeking a loss sensitive solution. marketing and distribution standard commercial lines provide insurance products and services through the company's home office located in hartford, connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. the products are marketed nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. the current pace of consolidation within the independent agent and broker distribution channel will likely continue such that, in the future a larger proportion of written premium will likely be concentrated among fewer agents and brokers. additionally the company offers insurance products to customers of payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies. specialty lines also provide insurance products and services through its home office located in hartford, connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. specialty lines markets its products nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent retail agents, brokers and wholesalers. competition in the small commercial marketplace, the hartford competes against a number of large national carriers, as well as regional carriers in certain territories. competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. the small commercial market has become increasingly competitive as carriers seek to differentiate themselves through product expansion, price reduction, enhanced service and cutting-edge technology. larger carriers such as the hartford have improved their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with agents through the use of predictive modeling tools and automation which speeds up the process of evaluating a risk and quoting new business. written premium growth rates in the small commercial market have slowed in recent years and underwriting margins have been pressured by increases in loss costs, particularly in workers' compensation, and higher catastrophes. a number of companies have sought to grow their business by increasing their underwriting appetite, appointing new agents and expanding business with existing agents. also, carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more aggressively competing for small commercial accounts as small commercial business has generally been less price-sensitive. middle market business is characterized as high touch and involves case-by-case underwriting and pricing decisions. the pricing of middle market accounts is prone to significant variation or cyclicality over time, with sensitivity to legislative and macro-economic forces. over the last several years, there has been a reduction in average premium size as shrinking company payrolls, smaller auto fleets, and fewer business locations depress insurance exposures. additionally, various state legislative reforms in recent years designed to control workers compensation indemnity costs have led to rate reductions in many states. these factors, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have resulted in more new business opportunities in the marketplace as customers shop their policies for a lower price. in the face of this competitive environment, the hartford continues to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. to gain a competitive advantage in this environment, carriers are improving automation with agents and brokers, increasing pricing sophistication, and enhancing their product offerings. these enhancements include industry specialization, with the hartford and other national carriers tailoring products and services to specific industry verticals such as technology, health care and renewable energy. 6 table of contents in the surety business, favorable underwriting results over the past couple of years have led to increased competition for market share, setting the stage for potential written price decreases. driven by the upheaval in the credit markets, new private construction activity has declined dramatically, resulting in lower demand for contract surety business. specialty lines is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that operate independently within their specific industries. these businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have different business models and operating cycles. specialty lines competes on an account- by-account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction. competition in this market includes other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the hartford provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. disciplined underwriting and targeted returns are the objectives of specialty lines since premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment's view of perceived market opportunity. for specialty casualty businesses, written pricing competition continues to be significant, particularly for the larger individual accounts. carriers are aggressively negotiating renewals with customers by initiating the renewal process well in advance of the policy renewal date, to improve retention, reducing new business opportunities within the marketplace. within the national account business, as the market firms, more insureds may opt for loss-sensitive products in lieu of guaranteed cost policies. carriers writing professional liability business are increasingly focused on profitable private, middle market companies. this trend has continued as the downturn in the economy has led to a significant drop in the number of initial public offerings, and volatility for all public companies. also, carriers' new business opportunities in the marketplace for directors &amp; officers and errors &amp; omissions insurance have been significantly influenced by customer perceptions of financial strength, as investment portfolio losses have had a negative effect on the financial strength ratings of some insurers. in the commercial marketplace, the weak economy has prompted carriers to offer differentiated products and services as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. in addition to the initiatives specific to each of the hartford's property &amp; casualty commercial lines of business noted above, the company is leveraging its diverse product, service and distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated value in the market, while simultaneously increasing its ability to access its own diverse customer base for new product sales. consumer markets principal products and services consumer markets provides standard automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages to individuals across the united states, including a special program designed exclusively for members of aarp ( aarp program ). the hartford's auto and homeowners products provide coverage options and customized pricing tailored to a customer's individual risk. the hartford has individual customer relationships with aarp program policyholders and, as a group, these customers represent a significant portion of the total consumer markets' business. business sold to aarp members, either direct or through independent agents, amounted to earned premiums of $2.8 billion , $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. consumer markets also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through the aarp health program, with the current agreement in place through 2018. marketing and distribution consumer markets reaches diverse customers through multiple distribution channels including direct sales to the consumer, brokers and independent agents. in direct sales to the consumer, the company markets its products through a mix of media, including direct mail and e-commerce marketing, television and advertising, both digitally and in publications. most of consumer markets' direct sales to the consumer are associated with its exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp, with the current agreement in place until january 1, 2020, to market automobile, homeowners and home-based business insurance products to aarp's approximately 37 million members. this agreement provides consumer markets with an important competitive advantage given the number of baby boomers over age 50, many of whom become aarp members. consumer markets is also focused on targeting specific customer groups and writing business through partnerships and affinities other than aarp. the company has affinity agreements with the american kennel club, sierra club, the national wildlife federation and direct selling association. in addition to selling product through its relationship with aarp and other affinities, the company markets direct to the consumer within select underwriting markets, acquired through partnerships or list acquisitions, and to consumers in geographies where it is especially competitive. the agency channel provides customized products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market. these independent agents are not employees of the hartford. during 2011 and 2012, the company completed the rollout of its open road advantage auto product and its hartford home advantage homeowners' product. 7 table of contents competition the personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete on the basis of price, product, service (including claims handling), stability of the insurer and brand recognition. companies with recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. in recent years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and retain profitable business. this has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the consumer. industry sales of personal lines insurance direct to the consumer have been growing faster than sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance. carriers that distribute products mainly through agents compete by offering agents commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. more agents have been using comparative rater tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. the use of comparative rater tools has further increased price competition. carriers with more efficient cost structures will have an advantage in competing for new business through price. the use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business and carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. some companies, including the hartford, have written a greater percentage of their new business in preferred market segments which tend to have better loss experience but also lower average premiums. in addition, a number of companies have invested in telematics the use of devices in insured vehicles to transmit information about driving behavior such as miles driven, speed, acceleration, deceleration and are using that information to price the risk. companies that are the first to introduce telematics may enjoy a competitive advantage through favorable risk selection. group benefits principal products and services group benefits provides group life, accident and disability coverage, group retiree health and voluntary benefits to individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions. group benefits offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. policies sold in this segment are generally term insurance, allowing group benefits to adjust the rates or terms of its policies in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, declining interest rates, and other factors. policies are typically sold with one, two or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product. in addition to the products and services traditionally offered within each of its lines of business, group benefits offers the hartford productivity advantage ( thpa ), a single-company solution for leave management, integrating work absence data from the insurer's short-term and long-term group disability and workers' compensation insurance with its leave management administration services. marketing and distribution the group benefits distribution network includes an experienced group of company employees, managed through a regional sales office system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. competition group benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. this line of business focuses on both its risk management expertise and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. competitive factors affecting group benefits include the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for coverage and services, the company's relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of customer service. in addition, active price competition continues in the marketplace resulting in multi-year rate guarantees being offered to customers. top tier carriers in the marketplace also offer on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the group benefits business provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. 8 table of contents mutual funds principal products and services mutual funds offers mutual funds for retail accounts such as retirement plans and 529 college savings plans and provides investment-management and administrative services such as product design, implementation and oversight. in 2012, mutual funds expanded its relationship with wellington management, which serves as the primary sub-advisor for the hartford's 57 retail mutual funds, including equity, fixed-income and asset-allocation funds. marketing and distribution mutual fund sales professionals are segmented into two teams; a retail team and an institutional team. the retail team distributes the hartford's open-end funds and markets 529 college savings plans to national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions, independent financial advisors and registered investment advisors. the institutional team distributes the hartford's funds to professional buyers, such as broker-dealers, consultants, record keepers, and bank trust groups. competition mutual funds compete with other mutual fund companies along with investment brokerage companies and differentiate themselves through product solutions, performance, and service. in this non-proprietary broker sold market, the company and its competitors compete aggressively for net sales. talcott resolution talcott resolution's business is comprised of runoff business from the company's u.s. annuity, international annuity, and institutional and private-placement life insurance businesses. talcott resolution's mission is to pursue opportunities to reduce the size and risk of the annuity book of business while honoring the company's obligations to its annuity contractholders. talcott resolution manages approximately 1.7 million annuity contracts with account values of approximately $163 billion as of december 31, 2012. in 2009, the company suspended international annuity sales in its japan and european operations and institutional annuity sales in the united states. in march 2012, the company announced its intention to place its u.s. annuity business into runoff and sell its retirement plans and individual life businesses. subsequently, the company completed the sale of its u.s. individual annuities new business capabilities to forethought financial group and the sale of the administration and operating assets of its private placement life insurance business to philadelphia financial group, inc. the talcott resolution business segment also includes our retirement plans and individual life businesses that were sold in january 2013. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements. reserves the hartford establishes and carries as liabilities reserves for its insurance products to estimate for the following: a liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, as well as estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims; a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the life insurance policyholder as of the consolidated financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value; a liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; fair value reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and death and living benefit reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. further discussion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reserves, including asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a critical accounting estimates property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance. additional discussion may be found in the company's accounting policies for insurance product reserves within note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 9 table of contents reinsurance the hartford cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers for both its property and casualty and life insurance products. such arrangements do not relieve the hartford of its primary liability to policyholders. failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the hartford. for property and casualty insurance products, reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater diversification of business and limit the hartford's maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. a major portion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reinsurance is effected under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. the hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses over stipulated amounts. for life insurance products, the hartford is involved in both the cession and assumption of insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 , the company's policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any one of its operations was $10. for the years ended december 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the company did not make any significant changes in the terms under which reinsurance is ceded to other insurers. the company entered into two reinsurance transactions upon completion of the sales of its retirement plans and individual life businesses in january 2013. see note 2 - business dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions. in addition, the company has reinsured a portion of the risk associated with u.s. variable annuities and the associated guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ) riders, and of the risks associated with variable annuity contract and rider benefits issued by hartford life insurance k.k.'s ( hlikk ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. for further discussion on reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management. additional discussion may be found in the company's accounting policies for reinsurance within note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. investment operations the majority of the company's investment portfolios are managed by hartford investment management company ( himco ). himco manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the company's various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. the risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio limits for below investment grade holdings and foreign currency exposure limits. the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the company's results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. for further discussion of himco's portfolio management approach, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management credit risk. in addition to managing the general account assets of the company, himco is also a sec registered investment adviser for third party institutional clients, a sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital markets transactions. himco specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active portfolio management within a disciplined risk framework that seeks to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 , the fair value of himco's total assets under management was approximately $144.1 billion and $164.9 billion , respectively, of which $7.6 billion and $7.1 billion , respectively, were held in himco managed third party accounts. enterprise risk management the company has an enterprise risk management function ( erm ) that is charged with providing analysis of the company's risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the company's risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances. erm plays an integral role at the hartford by fostering a strong risk management culture and discipline. the mission of erm is to support the company in achieving its strategic priorities by: providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the company, including risk concentrations and correlations; helping management define the company's overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk return profile of the business relative to the company's strategic intent and financial underpinning; assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the company's overall risk philosophy; communicating and monitoring the firm's risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and providing valuable insight to assist leaders in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines. 10 table of contents enterprise risk management structure and governance at the hartford, the board of directors ( the board ) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight. it exercises its oversight function through its standing committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. in addition, the finance, investment and risk management committee ( firmco ), which is comprised of all members of the board, has responsibility for overseeing the investment activities, financial management, and risk management activities of the company and its subsidiaries, and all risks that do not fall within the oversight responsibility of any other standing committee. the audit committee is responsible for discussing with management risk assessment policies and overseeing enterprise operational risk. at the corporate level, the company's enterprise chief risk officer ( ecro or chief risk officer ) leads erm. the chief risk officer reports directly to the company's chief executive officer ( ceo ). reporting to the ecro are the chief insurance risk officer ( ciro ), chief operational risk officer ( coro ), chief market risk officer ( cmro ), head of asset liability management, and himco chief risk officer. the company has established the enterprise risk and capital committee ( ercc ) that includes the company's ceo, chief financial officer ( cfo ), chief investment officer ( cio ), chief risk officer, the divisional presidents and the general counsel. the ercc is responsible for managing the company's risks and overseeing the enterprise risk management program. the ercc also manages the capital structure of the enterprise and is responsible the attribution of capital to the lines of business. the ercc reports to the board primarily through firmco and through interactions with the audit committee. the company also has committees that manage specific risks and recommend risk mitigation strategies to the ercc. these committees include, but are not limited to, the company and division asset liability committees, catastrophe risk committee, emerging risk committees, model oversight committees ( moc ) and operational risk committee ( orc ). risk management framework at the company, risk is managed at multiple levels. the first line of risk management is generally the responsibility of the lines of business. senior business leaders are responsible for taking and managing risks specific to their business objectives and business environment. in many cases, the second line of risk management is the principal responsibility of erm. erm has the responsibility to ensure the company has insight into its aggregate risk and that risks are managed within the company's overall risk tolerance. internal audit forms the third line of risk management by helping assess and ensure that risk controls are present and effective. the company's risk management framework consists of four core elements: 1. risk culture and governance: the company has established policies for its major risks and a formal governance structure with leadership oversight and an assignment of accountability and authority. the governance structure starts at the board and cascades to the ercc and then to individual risk committees across the company. in addition, the company promotes a strong risk management culture and high expectations around ethical behavior. 2. risk identification and assessment: through its erm organization, the company has developed processes for the identification, assessment, and, when appropriate, response to internal and external risks to the company's operations and business objectives. risk identification and prioritization has been established within each area, including processes around emerging risks. 3. risk appetite and limits: the company has a formal risk appetite framework that is approved by the company's ercc and reviewed by the board. the risk appetite framework includes risk appetite statements, risk preferences, risk tolerances and an associated limit structure for each of its major insurance and financial risks. these formal limits are encapsulated in formal risk policies that are reviewed at least annually by the ercc. 4. risk monitoring, controls and communication: the company monitors its major risks at the enterprise level through a number of enterprise reports, including but not limited to, a monthly risk dashboard, tracking the return on risk-capital across products, and regular stress testing. erm communicates the company's risk exposures to senior and executive management and the board, and reviews key business performance metrics, risk indicators, audit reports, risk/control self assessments and risk event data. 11 table of contents risk exposures and quantification the company quantifies its enterprise insurance and financial risk exposures using multiple lenses including statutory, economic and, where appropriate, u.s. gaap. erm leverages various modeling techniques and metrics to provide a view of the company's risk exposure in both normal and stressed environments. erm regularly monitors the company's risk exposure as compared to defined statutory limits and provides regular reporting to the ercc. in order to quantify group capital levels the company uses an economic capital model ( ecm ) to quantify the value of risk management across the business lines and to advance its risk-based decision-making and optimization across risk and business. the company also uses the ecm to inform the attribution of risk capital to each line of business. the company categorizes its main risks as follows in order to achieve a consistent and disciplined approach to quantifying, evaluating, and managing risk: insurance risk operational risk financial risk business risk insurance risk the company defines insurance risk as its exposure to loss due to property, liability, mortality, morbidity, disability, longevity and other perils and risks covered under its policies, including adverse development on loss reserves supporting its products and geographic accumulations of loss over time due to property or casualty catastrophes. operational risk the company defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. financial risk financial risk is broadly defined by the company to include liquidity, interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, and credit risks, all of which have the potential to materially impact the company's financial condition. financial risk also includes exposure to events that may cause correlated movement in the above risk factors. business risk the company manages its business risk at all levels of the organization. the company categorizes its business risk as strategic risk and management risk. strategic risk is defined as the risk to the defined company objectives from adverse developments in the company's strategy vis- -vis changing market conditions and competitor actions. management risk is defined as the risk to defined company objectives from the ineffective or inefficient execution of the company's strategic and business decisions. enterprise strategic and management risks are assessed through strategic, business and operating plan reviews, as well as through management self-assessment processes and benchmarking. for further discussion on risk management, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management. regulation insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states. the extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. 12 table of contents most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the hartford. this legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department's prior approval. in the jurisdictions in which the company's insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of the hartford's outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory filings. certain of the company's life insurance subsidiaries sold variable life insurance, variable annuity, and some fixed guaranteed products that are securities registered with the sec under the securities act of 1933, as amended. some of the products have separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 act ), and/or are regulated by state law. separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation. moreover, each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund that is also registered as an investment company under the 1940 act ( underlying funds ). the company offers these underlying funds and retail mutual funds that are registered with and regulated by the sec. in addition, other subsidiaries of the company sold and distributed the company's variable insurance products, underlying funds and retail mutual funds as broker dealers and are subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), the sec and/or in, some instances, state securities administrators. other entities operate as investment advisers registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. one subsidiary is an investment company registered under the 1940 act. because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. some of these regulations include, among other things, regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers' funds, corporate governance, capital, record keeping, and reporting requirements. the extent of insurance regulation on business outside the united states varies significantly among the countries in which the hartford operates. some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate insurers extensively. foreign insurers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. the hartford's international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective countries. in addition, as described under legislative developments, we are subject to a number of dodd-frank act provisions. failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees. we cannot predict the impact of these actions on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. intellectual property we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. we have a worldwide trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the hartford name, the stag logo and the combination of these two marks. the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. we regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. employees the hartford has approximately 22,500 employees as of december 31, 2012 . available information the hartford makes available, free of charge, on or through its internet website

contents item 1a. risk factors investing in the hartford involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford and could also cause the trading price of our securities, including our common stock and other equity-related securities, to experience significant fluctuations and volatility. however, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones related to our business and the hartford may also be subject to other general risks that are not specifically enumerated which may have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). the following risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance. our operating environment remains subject to uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery. the success of the realignment of our businesses and our capital management plan are subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks and may not be adequate to mitigate the financial, competitive and other risks associated with our operating environment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the significant disruptions and difficult conditions in global economies and capital markets experienced in recent years has cast significant uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of an economic recovery, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2013. continued high unemployment, lower family income, higher tax rates, including on small business owners, lower business investment and lower consumer spending have adversely affected or may in the future adversely affect the demand for financial and insurance products, as well as their profitability in some cases. the rate of growth and recovery, including employment levels, from the recession has been below historic levels and a period of slow growth may persist for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the success of the realignment of our businesses and our capital management plan remain subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks. we may not achieve all of the benefits we expect to derive from our plan to repurchase $500 of our equity and reduce our debt by $1 billion over the course of 2013 and 2014 and our decision to focus on our property and casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses, place our individual annuity business into runoff and sell the individual life, woodbury financial services and retirement plans businesses. our capital management plan is subject to execution risks, including, among others, risks related to market fluctuations and investor interest and potential legal constraints that could delay execution at an otherwise optimal time. there can be no assurance that we will in fact complete our capital management plan over the planned time frame or at all. further, our opportunities to reduce the size and risk of the variable annuity book may be limited and initiatives pursued may not achieve the anticipated benefits. we also may not be able to eliminate expenses associated with the divested businesses in the manner and on the schedule we currently anticipate and we may incur additional restructuring charges. we may take further actions beyond the capital management plan and business realignment, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings that may involve additional uncertainties and risks that negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. in addition, we are exposed to execution risk relating to the continued reinvestment of our investment portfolios and the continuing refinement of our hedge programs for our run-off annuity block. if our actions are not adequate, our ability to support the scale of our business and to absorb operating losses and liabilities under our customer contracts could be impaired, which would in turn adversely affect our overall competitiveness and the capital position of the company. our results, financial condition and statutory capital remain sensitive to equity and credit market performance and effects of interest rates and foreign currency, and we expect that market conditions will put pressure on returns in our investment portfolios and that our hedging costs (in particular with respect to our in-force variable annuity blocks) will remain higher than historical levels. interest rates in recent periods continue to be at or near historically low levels. a sustained low interest rate environment would continue to pressure our net investment income and could result in lower margins, increased pension expense and lower estimated gross profits on certain products. further, if global economic conditions worsen and real estate valuations drop to new cycle lows, we may experience additional realized and unrealized investment losses, particularly in the real estate and financial services sectors. negative rating agency actions with respect to our investments could also indirectly adversely affect our statutory capital and risk-based capital ( rbc ) ratios, which could in turn have other negative consequences for our business and results. even if the measures we have taken (or take in the future) are effective to mitigate the risks associated with our current operating environment, they may have unintended consequences. for example, rebalancing our hedging program to protect economic value, while being mindful of statutory surplus, may result in greater earnings volatility under generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ( u.s. gaap ). we could be required to consider actions to manage our capital position and liquidity or further reduce our exposure to market and financial risks. we may also be forced to sell assets on unfavorable terms that could cause us to incur losses or lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery. we could also face other pressures, such as employee recruitment and retention issues and potential loss of distribution for our products. 14 table of contents we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, market volatility, foreign exchange rates and global real estate market deterioration that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with our operations in mutual funds and talcott resolution, such as u.s. and international variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. should equity markets decline from current levels, assets under management and related fee income will be reduced. such a decline could result in a need for significant additional allocated capital to certain insurance companies due to rating agency and regulatory requirements, including with respect to stress scenarios. furthermore, certain of our products have guaranteed benefits that increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure should equity markets decline. sustained declines in equity markets may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support these products and adversely affect our ability to support our other businesses. interest rates in recent periods continue to be at or near historically low levels. as noted above, a sustained low interest rate environment would continue to pressure our net investment income and could result in lower margins, increased pension expense and lower estimated gross profits on certain products. in addition, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities within our talcott resolution operations, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long-term interest rates subjects us to reinvestment risks, increased hedging costs, spread compression and capital volatility. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will reduce the market value of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates were to rise dramatically within a six-to-twelve month time period, certain products within our talcott resolution division might be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. although our products have features such as surrender charges and market-value adjustments, we are subject to disintermediation risk. an increase in interest rates can also impact our tax planning strategies and in particular our ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. if issuer credit spreads widen significantly or retain historically wide levels over an extended period of time, additional other-than-temporary impairments and decreases in the market value of our investment portfolio will likely result. in addition, losses have also occurred due to the volatility in credit spreads. when credit spreads widen, we incur losses associated with the credit derivatives where the company assumes exposure. when credit spreads tighten, we incur losses associated with derivatives where the company has purchased credit protection. if credit spreads tighten significantly, the company's net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity can make it difficult to value certain of our securities when trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ( mva ) annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the u.s. and japanese libor in japan. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the u.s. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the u.s. or japanese libor in japan, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this has resulted and may continue to result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product. our primary foreign currency exchange risk is related to certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan and u.k. variable annuities. the strengthening of the yen compared with other currencies would substantially increase our exposure to pay yen-denominated obligations. in addition, our foreign currency exchange risk relates to net income from foreign operations, non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, and our yen-denominated individual fixed annuity product. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated annuity products. a strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to foreign currencies will increase our exposure to the u.s. variable annuity guarantee benefits where policyholders have elected to invest in international funds, generating losses and statutory surplus strain. 15 table of contents our real estate market exposure includes investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations, mortgage and real estate partnerships, and mortgage loans. deterioration in the real estate market in the recent past has adversely affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. significant further deterioration in the real estate market, including increases in property vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures, could result in new cycle lows for market values and have a negative impact on sources of refinancing resulting in reduced market liquidity and higher risk premiums. this could result in impairments of real estate backed securities, a reduction in net investment income associated with real estate partnerships, and increases in our valuation allowance for mortgage loans. significant declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads, inflation, the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, or global real estate market deterioration, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes, both natural and man-made, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, wind storms, fires, tornadoes, explosions, pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, tornadoes in the midwest and southeast, earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states, and the spread of disease in metropolitan areas. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. starting in 2004 and 2005, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events have incorporated medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity - reflecting the potential influence of multi-decadal climate patterns within the atlantic. in addition, changing climate conditions across longer time scales, including the potential risk of broader climate change, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the severity of certain natural catastrophe losses across various geographic regions. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and increase the potency of viral pathogens and bacterial outbreaks that can cause pandemics or adverse mortality trends. potential examples of the impact of climate change on catastrophe exposure include, but are not limited to the following: an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere, more frequent brush fires in certain geographies due to prolonged periods of drought, higher incidence of deluge flooding, and the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. additionally, due to such catastrophes, policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment products. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. to the extent that loss experience unfolds or models improve, we will seek to reflect any of these changes in the design and pricing of our products. however, the company may be exposed to regulatory or legislative actions that prevent a full accounting of loss expectations in the design or pricing of our products or result in additional risk-shifting to the insurance industry. 16 table of contents actual results could materially differ from the analytical models we use to assist our decision making in key areas such as underwriting, capital, hedging, reserving, and catastrophe risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we employ various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, hedging, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk. both proprietary and third party models we use incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of interest rates, capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, currency exchange rates, policyholder behavior, equity markets and inflation, among others. the modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions. consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. the profitability and financial condition of the company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. if, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or our estimates of the risks we are exposed to prove to be materially inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity at the time it becomes known. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge or restrict an insurer's ability to offer or enforce specific policy deductibles. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates or accept additional risk not contemplated in our existing rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state's insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in all of our property and casualty insurance product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. in addition, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 17 table of contents the amount of statutory capital that we have, and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements, can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market, interest rate and foreign currency conditions, changes in policyholder behavior and changes in rating agency models. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdiction in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of internal reinsurance arrangements, and changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios will generally increase. this may be offset, however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and rbc requirements could also increase, lowering rbc ratios. for example, while our property and casualty companies are expected to generate statutory surplus in 2013, our life companies' statutory surplus, excluding the statutory surplus gain from the dispositions of individual life and retirement plans, is expected to be flat to positive in 2013, which while an improvement over 2012 is challenged due to continued low interest rates and high loss cost trends in group benefits. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, could increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, at their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency's judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products. 18 table of contents our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for a further discussion of potential impacts of ratings downgrades on derivative instruments, including potential collateral calls, see the "capital resources and liquidity - derivative commitments" section of item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated rather than diversified. our adjustment of our risk management program relating to products we offered with guaranteed benefits to emphasize protection of economic value will likely result in greater u.s. gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income (loss) in periods of rising equity market pricing levels. some of the in-force business within our talcott resolution operations, especially variable annuities, offer guaranteed benefits which, in the event of a decline in equity markets, would not only result in lower earnings, but will also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we are also subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, including the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ( gmab ), guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) associated with in-force variable annuities. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. however, due to the severe economic conditions experienced in recent years, we adjusted our risk management program to place greater relative emphasis on the protection economic value. this shift in relative emphasis has resulted in greater u.s. gaap earnings volatility and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income (loss) in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, lower interest rates, rises in volatility and weakening of the yen against other currencies. while we believe that these actions have improved the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay and in turn may need additional capital to support in-force business. we are also subject to the risk that these management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity . the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company's consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, and separate account assets. the determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment in determining their fair values and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 19 table of contents evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether a credit and/or non-credit impairment exists and whether an impairment should be recognized in current period earnings or in other comprehensive income. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company currently uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost; changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer; whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments; changes in the financial condition of the security's underlying collateral; the payment structure of the security; the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, commercial and residential property value declines that vary by property type and location and average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year; other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies; our intent to sell a debt or an equity security with debt-like characteristics (collectively, debt security ) or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery; and our intent and ability to retain an equity security without debt-like characteristics for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value. impairment losses in earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities (which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities, european private and sovereign issuers, or other high yielding bonds) mortgage loans or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities or loans may deteriorate causing these securities or loans to incur losses. 20 table of contents our investment portfolio includes securities backed by real estate assets the value of which have been adversely impacted by the recent recessionary period, high unemployment rates and the associated property value declines, ultimately resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows for certain securities. the company also has exposure to european based issuers of securities and providers of reinsurance, as well as indirect european exposure resulting from the variable annuity products that it has sold in japan and the united kingdom. further details of the european private and sovereign issuers held within the investment portfolio and indirect variable annuity exposures can be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - investment portfolio risks and risk management. the company's european based reinsurance arrangements are further described in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - investment portfolio risks and risk management - european exposure. further property value declines and loss rates that exceed our current estimates, as outlined in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - other-than-temporary impairments, or a worsening of global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. to the extent the investment portfolio is not adequately diversified, concentrations of credit risk may exist which could negatively impact the company if significant adverse events or developments occur in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic regions. the company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company's stockholders' equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government, and the government of japan. however, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, the company's credit concentration risk could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company deferred acquisition costs associated with the prior sales of its universal and variable life and variable annuity products. these costs are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the company evaluates the egps compared to the dac asset to determine if an impairment exists. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and gmib using components of egps. the projection of egps, or components of egps, requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns in excess of amounts credited to policyholders, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin (including impairments), mortality, benefit utilization, annuitization and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques, could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including lapse rates, benefit utilization, surrenders, and annuitization, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb and gmib which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the company to limit risk. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 21 table of contents deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management's determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains, to offset previously recognized capital losses, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on realized capital losses, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 ( tripra ) is also limited. although tripra provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism, those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. under tripra, once our losses exceed 20% of our subject commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 85% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. our estimated deductible under the program is $1.2 billion for 2013. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. it is also possible that future legislative action could change tripra, which is due to expire at the end of 2014, unless extended. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our results during the period or periods affected and, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks or other geopolitical or military crises, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. for some asbestos and environmental claims, we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these longer-tailed exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related periods. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now, but could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 22 table of contents we may incur losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the effect of losses that may arise from catastrophes to transfer other risks that can cause unfavorable results of operations, or to effect the sale of one line of business to an independent company through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers' credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. historically, reinsurance pricing has changed significantly from time to time. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop to the extent possible other alternatives to reinsurance. further, due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables will be due, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our principal competitors are other property and casualty insurers, group benefits providers and mutual funds. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may experience difficulty in marketing, distributing and providing investment advisory services in relation to our products through current and future distribution channels and advisory firms. we distribute our insurance products and mutual funds through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through or in connection with individual third-party arrangements. for example, we market our consumer markets products in part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 2020. our ability to distribute products through affinity partners may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. in december 2011, we entered into a 5-year agreement with wellington management company as the preferred sub-advisor for the hartford mutual funds. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties, including potentially as a result of a strategic transaction, could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the impact of regulatory initiatives, including the enactment of the dodd-frank act, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory developments relating to the recent financial crisis may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. u.s. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities, including the sec, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve"), the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ), the nyse and the financial industry regulatory authority, inc. ( finra ) are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. such measures are likely to lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important companies in particular. such measures could include taxation of financial transactions and restrictions on employee compensation. the dodd-frank act was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. implementation of the dodd-frank act is ongoing and may affect our operations and governance in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 23 table of contents certain provisions of the dodd-frank act will require central clearing of, and/or impose new margin and capital requirements on, derivatives transactions, which we expect will increase the costs of our hedging program. other provisions in the dodd-frank act that may impact us include: the new federal insurance office within treasury; the possible adverse impact on the pricing and liquidity of the securities in which we invest resulting from the proprietary trading and market making limitation of the volcker rule; the possible prohibition of certain asset-backed securities transactions that could adversely impact our ability to offer insurance-linked securities; and enhancements to corporate governance, especially regarding risk management. the dodd-frank act vests the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) with the power to designate systemically important institutions, which will be subject to special regulatory supervision and other provisions intended to prevent, or mitigate the impact of, future disruptions in the u.s. financial system. systemically important institutions are limited to large bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies that are so important that their potential failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states. the fsoc published a final rule setting forth the process they propose to follow when designating systemically important nonbank financial companies in april 2012. based on its most current financial data, the hartford is below the initial quantitative thresholds that will be used to determine which nonbank companies merit consideration. the fsoc has indicted it will review on a quarterly basis whether nonbank financial institutions meet the metrics for further review. if we are designated as a systemically important institution, we could be subject to higher capital requirements and additional regulatory oversight imposed by the federal reserve, as well as to post-event assessments imposed by the fdic to recoup the costs associated with the orderly liquidation of other systemically important institutions in the event one or more such institutions fails. further, in certain circumstances the fdic is authorized to petition a state court to commence an insolvency proceeding to liquidate an insurance company that fails in the event the insurer's state regulator fails to act. if designated, we could also be subject to increased capital requirements or quantitative limits with respect to our sponsorship of and investments in private equity and hedge funds, which could limit our discretion in managing our general account. the federal reserve issued a proposed rule in december 2011 that would apply capital and liquidity requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, and stress testing and risk management requirements to systemically important institutions, and subject such institutions to an early remediation regime based on these requirements. the federal reserve has noted that they may tailor the application of the proposed rule to the particular attributes of systemically important nonbank financial companies. if the hartford were to be designated as systemically important by the fsoc, these requirements could apply to the hartford. however, it is not yet clear how or to what extent these requirements would be applied to systemically important nonbank financial companies. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments involving claim litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or significant changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable law could have a similar effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves, and how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our products appropriately. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could also be adversely affected if judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from current expectations. 24 table of contents potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we are subject to extensive u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and can affect our strategy, as well as the demand for and profitability of the products we offer. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; protecting privacy; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; approving acquisitions, divestitures and similar transactions; restricting the payment of dividends to the parent company and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; requiring insurers to dividend any excess profits to policy holders; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. for example, the naic and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. the naic has undertaken a solvency modernization initiative focused on updating the u.s. insurance solvency regulation framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. any proposed or future legislation or naic initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. further, because these laws and regulations are complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal, accounting, or reserving issue may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. the application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may not be consistent with the opinion of state insurance departments. we cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate (primarily the japan financial services agency, the central bank of ireland and the united kingdom financial services authority), which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. 25 table of contents these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. see the risk factor, the impact of regulatory initiatives, including the enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ), could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations. the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. these obligations include payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends on our capital stock. the connecticut insurance holding company laws limit the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers. in addition, these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment by those subsidiaries of any dividend which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of: 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as of december 31 of the preceding year, or net income, or net gain from operations if the subsidiary is a life insurance company, for the previous calendar year, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. in addition, if any dividend of a connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer's earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, or deemed commercially domiciled, generally contain similar, and in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. dividends paid to us by our insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on their cash requirements. for further discussion on dividends from insurance subsidiaries, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - capital resources &amp; liquidity. our rights to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries, for example, upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the ability of holders of our common stock to benefit indirectly from a distribution, are subject to the prior claims of creditors of the applicable subsidiary, except to the extent that we may be a creditor of that subsidiary. claims on these subsidiaries by persons other than us include, as of december 31, 2012, claims by policyholders for benefits payable amounting to $111.9 billion , claims by separate account holders of $ 141.6 billion , and other liabilities including claims of trade creditors, claims from guaranty associations and claims from holders of debt obligations, amounting to $14.4 billion. holders of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. as of december 31, 2012, there were 575,000 shares of our series f preferred stock issued and outstanding. under the terms of the series f preferred stock, our ability to declare and pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock will be subject to restrictions in the event we fail to declare and pay (or set aside for payment) full dividends on the series f preferred stock. the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. 26 table of contents if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we use computer systems to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems or third-parties firms to maintain our systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, conducting our financial reporting and analysis, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios and hedging programs. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a terrorist attack or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees and business partners are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed. moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer related penetrations. while, to date, the hartford has not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity, administrative and technical controls as well as other preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service and other cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties with whom we interact, impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. in addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to utilize such capabilities in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with regulations enacted by u.s. federal and state governments, the european union, japan or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others. a misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from an employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions are also subject to the risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third party liability and first party insurance coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all loss. our framework for managing operational risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us that could adversely affect our businesses. our business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage operational risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and other activities, many of which are very complex and for some of which we rely on third parties. we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of these activities through a risk control framework encompassing a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. we cannot be completely confident that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks, or that our employees and third-party agents will effectively implement them. management of operational risks can fail for a number of reasons, including design failure, systems failure, failures to perform, cyber security attacks, human error, or unlawful activities on the part of employees or third parties. in the event that our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations. 27 table of contents if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. as we continue to focus on reducing the expense necessary to support our operations, we have become increasingly committed to outsourcing strategies for certain technology and business functions. if third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations, including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. for other risks associated with our outsourcing of certain functions, see the risk factor, if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for instance, the steps taken by the federal government to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would have gone into effect on january 1, 2013 will result in higher tax rates, including for many small business owners who are already preparing for increased costs associated with healthcare reform. this may cause small businesses to hire fewer workers and decrease investment in their businesses, including purchasing vehicles, property and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. conversely, if income tax rates decline it could adversely affect the company's ability to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. many of the products that the company previously sold benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company previously sold individual life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders' beneficiaries. we also sold annuity contracts that allowed policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. the company also benefits from certain tax items, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. because the company no longer sells individual life insurance, changes in the future taxation of life insurance and/or annuity contracts will not adversely impact future sales. if, however, the treatment of earnings accrued inside a life or annuity contract was changed prospectively, and the taxation of current contracts was grandfathered, it would make running off our existing annuity business more difficult. furthermore, changes to the taxation of tax exempt bonds could limit our investment choices and depress portfolio yields. lastly, there could be changes in the taxation of reserving methodologies for p&amp;c companies that could increase our taxes. due in large part to the recent financial crisis that has affected many governments, there is an increasing risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and/or their policyholders. for example, the obama administration proposed federal budget released in february 2012 entitled fy 2013, budget of the united states government included among many other proposals, a proposal which, if enacted, would have adversely affected the amount of the dividends received deduction the company currently enjoys. if this proposal were included in the federal budget proposal for fy 2014 and subsequently enacted, the company's actual tax expense could increase, reducing earnings. although the specific form of fy 2014 budget and any related legislation is uncertain, any such legislation could include provisions that lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company and/or its policyholders or not provide for grandfathering the current tax treatment of existing life and annuity products. this could occur in the context of deficit reduction or other tax reform. the effects of any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, and could result in lapses of policies currently held, and/or our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes. 28 table of contents regulatory requirements could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. before a person can acquire control of a u.s. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any such additional information as the insurance commissioner may deem necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders or in the public interest. generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer or its parent company. because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various u.s. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. other laws or required approvals pertaining to one or more of our existing subsidiaries, or a future subsidiary, may contain similar or additional restrictions on the acquisition of control of the company. these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control, including transactions that our board of directors and some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. u.s. gaap and related financial reporting requirements are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by the relevant authoritative bodies. such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. changes in u.s. gaap and financial reporting requirements, or in the interpretation of u.s. gaap or those requirements, could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. moreover, the sec is currently evaluating international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ) to determine whether ifrs should be incorporated into the financial reporting system for u.s. issuers. certain of these standards could result in material changes to our reported results of operation. in connection with the restatement of our results for the three and nine month period ended september 30, 2012, we identified a material weakness, since remediated, in our internal control over financial reporting and an ineffectiveness in our disclosure controls and procedures. future material weaknesses could lead to errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or untimely filings, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, and a decline in our stock price and that of our other securities. in connection with the restatement of our results for the three and nine month period ended september 30, 2012 and the filing of an amendment to our quarterly report on form 10-q for such period, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls for that same period were ineffective. we have since remediated such material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and in our disclosure controls and procedures, and as of december 31, 2012, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective within the meaning of exchange act rule 13a-15(e) and that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, taking into account the steps taken to address such material weakness. further material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or ineffectiveness in disclosure controls and procedures could result in errors in our financial statements or untimely filings, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, and a decline in our stock price and that of our other securities. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party's intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is

data, unless otherwise stated) general the hartford financial services group, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the hartford , the company , we , or our ) is an insurance and financial services company. the hartford, headquartered in connecticut, is among the largest providers of property and casualty insurance and investment products to both individual and business customers in the united states of america. also, the hartford continues to manage life and annuity products previously sold. hartford fire insurance company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of the hartford's subsidiaries. at december 31, 2013 , total assets and total stockholders' equity of the hartford were $277.9 billion and $18.9 billion , respectively. organization the hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry. the company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to consumers and businesses. the company seeks on an ongoing basis to develop and expand its distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies of scale and improved technology, and capitalizes on its brand name and the hartford stag logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry. in 2012, the hartford concluded an evaluation of its strategy and business portfolio. the company is currently focusing on its property &amp; casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses. the objective of this realignment is to position the organization for higher returns on equity, reduced sensitivity to capital markets, a lower cost of capital and increased financial flexibility. as a result, the company completed sales of its retirement plans, individual life and u.k. annuity businesses in 2013. in addition, the company sold woodbury financial services, inc. ("woodbury financial services", "wfs") an indirect wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary, and placed its annuity businesses into runoff in 2012. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business dispositions and note 20 - discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements. as a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, the hartford financial services group, inc. has no significant business operations of its own. therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations. additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the hartford financial services group, inc. may be found in the capital resources and liquidity section of part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md&amp;a ). reporting segments the hartford currently conducts business principally in six reporting segments including property &amp; casualty commercial, consumer markets, property &amp; casualty other operations, group benefits, mutual funds and talcott resolution as well as a corporate category. the hartford includes in its corporate category the company's debt financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities; and purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments. the following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of the hartford's reporting segments. for further discussion on the reporting segments, including financial disclosures of revenues by product line, geographical revenue, net income (loss), and assets for each reporting segment, see note 4 - segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements. 5 property &amp; casualty commercial principal products and services property &amp; casualty commercial provides businesses with workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages under several different products, primarily throughout the united states, within its standard commercial lines, which consists of the hartford's small commercial and middle market lines of business. additionally, a variety of customized insurance products and risk management services including workers' compensation, automobile, general liability, professional liability, livestock and specialty casualty coverages are offered through the segment's specialty lines. standard commercial lines seeks to offer products with coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder's individualized risk characteristics. for small businesses, those businesses whose annual payroll is under $5 and whose revenue and property values are less than $15 each, property and liability coverages are bundled as part of a single multi-peril package policy marketed under the spectrum name. medium-sized businesses, companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed the small business definition, are served within middle market. the middle market line of business provides workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, fidelity, surety and marine coverages. within the specialty lines, a significant portion of the specialty casualty business, including workers' compensation business, is written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides collateral to support loss payments made within their deductible. the specialty casualty business also provides retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. the captive and specialty programs business provides tailored property and casualty programs primarily to customers with common risk characteristics and those seeking a loss sensitive solution. the financial products business provides a suite of management and professional liability insurance products including d&amp;o (directors and officers) and e&amp;o (errors and omissions) liability products. marketing and distribution standard commercial lines provide insurance products and services through the company's home office located in hartford, connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. the products are marketed nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. the current pace of consolidation within the independent agent and broker distribution channel will likely continue such that, in the future a larger proportion of written premium will likely be concentrated among fewer agents and brokers. additionally the company offers insurance products to customers of payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies. specialty lines also provide insurance products and services through its home office located in hartford, connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. specialty lines markets its products nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent retail agents, brokers and wholesalers. competition in the small commercial marketplace, the hartford competes against a number of large national carriers, as well as regional carriers in certain territories. competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. the small commercial market has become increasingly competitive as carriers seek to differentiate themselves through product expansion, price reduction, enhanced service and cutting-edge technology. larger carriers such as the hartford have improved their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with agents through the use of predictive modeling tools and automation which speeds up the process of evaluating a risk and quoting new business. written premium growth rates in the small commercial market have slowed in recent years due to the economy and underwriting margins have been pressured by increased competition. a number of companies have sought to grow their business by increasing their underwriting appetite, appointing new agents and expanding business with existing agents. also, carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more aggressively competing for small commercial accounts as small commercial business has generally been less price-sensitive. middle market business is characterized as high touch and involves case-by-case underwriting and pricing decisions. the pricing of middle market accounts is prone to significant variation or cyclicality over time, with sensitivity to legislative and macro-economic forces. additionally, various state legislative reforms in recent years designed to control workers compensation indemnity costs have led to rate reductions in many states. these factors, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have resulted in more new business opportunities in the marketplace as customers shop their policies for a lower price. in the face of this competitive environment, the hartford continues to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. to gain a competitive advantage in this environment, carriers are improving automation with agents and brokers, increasing pricing sophistication, and enhancing their product offerings. these enhancements include industry specialization, with the hartford and other national carriers tailoring products and services to specific industry verticals such as technology, health care and renewable energy. 6 in the surety business, favorable underwriting results over the past couple of years have led to increased competition for market share, setting the stage for potential written price decreases. driven by the upheaval in the credit markets, new public construction activity remains at a historically low level, resulting in lower demand for contract surety business specialty lines is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that operate independently within their specific industries. these businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have different business models and operating cycles. specialty lines competes on an account- by-account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction. competition in this market includes other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the hartford provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. disciplined underwriting and targeted returns are the objectives of specialty lines since premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment's view of perceived market opportunity. for specialty casualty businesses, written pricing competition continues to be significant, particularly for the larger individual accounts. carriers are aggressively negotiating renewals with customers by initiating the renewal process well in advance of the policy renewal date, to improve retention, reducing new business opportunities within the marketplace. within the national account business, as written pricing increases, more insureds may opt for loss-sensitive products in lieu of guaranteed cost policies. carriers writing professional liability business are increasingly focused on profitable private, middle market companies. this trend has continued as the downturn in the economy has led to a significant drop in the number of initial public offerings, and volatility for all public companies. also, carriers' new business opportunities in the marketplace for directors &amp; officers and errors &amp; omissions insurance have been significantly influenced by customer perceptions of financial strength, as investment portfolio losses have had a negative effect on the financial strength ratings of some insurers. in the commercial marketplace, the weak economy has prompted carriers to offer differentiated products and services as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. in addition to the initiatives specific to each of the hartford's property &amp; casualty commercial lines of business noted above, the company is leveraging its diverse product, service and distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated value in the market, while simultaneously increasing its ability to access its own diverse customer base for new product sales. consumer markets principal products and services consumer markets provides automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the united states, including a special program designed exclusively for members of aarp ( aarp program ). the hartford's auto and homeowners products provide coverage options and customized pricing tailored to a customer's individual risk. the hartford has individual customer relationships with aarp program policyholders and, as a group, these customers represent a significant portion of the total consumer markets' business. business sold to aarp members, either direct or through independent agents, amounted to earned premiums of $2.9 billion , $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. consumer markets previously operated a member contact center for health insurance products offered through the aarp health program (catalyst 360). for further information regarding the sale of catalyst 360 in 2013, see note 2 - business dispositions of notes to consolidated financial statements. marketing and distribution consumer markets reaches diverse customers through multiple distribution channels including direct sales to the consumer, brokers and independent agents. in direct sales to the consumer, the company markets its products through a mix of media, including direct mail and e-commerce marketing, television and advertising, both digitally and in publications. most of consumer markets' direct sales to the consumer are associated with its exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp, with the current agreement in place through january 1, 2023, to market automobile, homeowners and home-based business insurance products to aarp's approximately 38 million members. this agreement provides consumer markets with an important competitive advantage given the number of baby boomers over age 50, many of whom become aarp members. during 2013, the company had affinity agreements with the american kennel club, sierra club, the national wildlife federation and direct selling association. in addition to selling product through its relationship with aarp and other affinities, the company markets direct to the consumer within select underwriting markets, acquired through partnerships or list acquisitions, and to consumers in geographies where we think we have a competitive advantage. the agency channel provides products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market. these independent agents are not employees of the hartford. 7 competition the personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete on the basis of price, product, service (including claims handling), stability of the insurer and brand recognition. companies with recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. in recent years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and retain profitable business. this has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the consumer. industry sales of personal lines insurance direct to the consumer have been growing faster than sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance. carriers that distribute products mainly through agents compete by offering agents commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. more agents have been using comparative rater tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. the use of comparative rater tools has further increased price competition. carriers with more efficient cost structures will have an advantage in competing for new business through price. the use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business and carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. some companies, including the hartford, have written a greater percentage of their new business in preferred market segments which tend to have better loss experience but also lower average premiums. in addition, a number of companies have invested in telematics the use of devices in insured vehicles to transmit information about driving behavior such as miles driven, speed, acceleration, deceleration and are using that information to price the risk. companies that are the first to introduce telematics may enjoy a competitive advantage through favorable risk selection. group benefits principal products and services group benefits provides group life, accident and disability coverage, group retiree health and voluntary benefits to individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions. group benefits offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. policies sold in this segment are generally term insurance, allowing group benefits to adjust the rates or terms of its policies in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, declining interest rates, and other factors. policies are typically sold with one, two or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product and market segment. in addition to the products and services traditionally offered within each of its lines of business, group benefits offers the hartford productivity advantage ( thpa ), a single-company solution for leave management, integrating work absence data from the insurer's short-term and long-term group disability and workers' compensation insurance with its leave management administration services. marketing and distribution the group benefits distribution network includes an experienced group of company employees, managed through a regional sales office system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. competition group benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. this line of business focuses on both its risk management expertise and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. competitive factors affecting group benefits include the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for coverage and services, the company's relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of customer service. in addition, active price competition continues in the marketplace resulting in multi-year rate guarantees being offered to customers. top tier carriers in the marketplace also offer on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the group benefits business provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. 8 mutual funds principal products and services mutual funds offers mutual funds for retail and retirement accounts and provides investment-management and administrative services such as product design, implementation and oversight. this business also includes the runoff of the mutual funds supporting the company's variable annuity products. wellington management company, llp ("wellington management") serves as the primary sub-advisor for the hartford's 96 mutual funds, including equity, fixed-income and asset-allocation funds. marketing and distribution mutual fund sales professionals are segmented into two teams; a retail team and an institutional team. the retail team distributes the hartford's open-end funds and markets 529 college savings plans to national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions, independent financial advisors and registered investment advisors. the institutional team distributes the hartford's funds to professional buyers, such as broker-dealers, consultants, record keepers, and bank trust groups. competition mutual funds compete with other mutual fund companies along with investment brokerage companies and differentiate themselves through product solutions, performance, and service. in this non-proprietary broker sold market, the company and its competitors compete aggressively for net sales. talcott resolution talcott resolution's business is comprised of runoff business from the company's u.s. annuity, international annuity (in japan), and institutional and private-placement life insurance businesses. talcott resolution's mission is to pursue opportunities to reduce the size and risk of the annuity book of business while honoring the company's obligations to its annuity contractholders. talcott resolution manages approximately 1.4 million annuity contracts with account values of approximately $150 billion as of december 31, 2013 . in 2013, the company completed the sale of its u.k. annuity business. the talcott resolution business segment includes our retirement plans and individual life businesses sold in 2013 through reinsurance agreements with the respective buyers. in 2012, the company completed the sale of its u.s. individual annuities new business capabilities and the sale of the administration and operating assets of its private placement life insurance business. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business dispositions and note 20 - discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements. reserves the hartford establishes and carries as liabilities reserves for its insurance products to estimate for the following: a liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, as well as estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims; a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the life insurance policyholder as of the consolidated financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value; a liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; fair value reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and death and living benefit reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. further discussion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reserves, including asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a critical accounting estimates property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance. additional discussion may be found in the company's accounting policies for insurance product reserves within note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements. 9 reinsurance the hartford cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers for both its property and casualty and life insurance products. such arrangements do not relieve the hartford of its primary liability to policyholders. failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the hartford. for property and casualty insurance products, reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater diversification of business and limit the hartford's maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. a major portion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reinsurance is effected under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. the hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses over stipulated amounts. for life insurance products, the hartford is involved in both the cession and assumption of insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. the company entered into two reinsurance transactions to cede risks upon completion of the sales of its retirement plans and individual life businesses in january 2013. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business dispositions of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, the company has reinsured to third parties a portion of the risk associated with u.s. variable annuities and the associated guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ) riders, and of the risks associated with variable annuity contract and rider benefits issued by hartford life insurance kk ( hlikk ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. for further discussion of reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management. additional discussion of reinsurance may also be found in note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements. investment operations the majority of the company's investment portfolios are managed by hartford investment management company ( himco ). himco manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the company's various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. the risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset sector, credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio limits for below investment grade holdings and foreign currency exposure limits. the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the company's results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset diversification, asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. for further discussion of himco's portfolio management approach, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management. in addition to managing the general account assets of the company, himco is also a sec registered investment adviser for third party institutional clients, a sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital markets transactions. himco specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active portfolio management within a disciplined risk framework that seeks to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012 , the fair value of himco's total assets under management was approximately $112.6 billion and $144.1 billion , respectively, of which $6.1 billion and $7.6 billion , respectively, were held in himco managed third party accounts. enterprise risk management the company has an enterprise risk management function ( erm ) that is charged with providing analysis of the company's risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the company's risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances. erm plays an integral role at the hartford by fostering a strong risk management culture and discipline. the mission of erm is to support the company in achieving its strategic priorities by: providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the company, including risk concentrations and correlations; helping management define the company's overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk return profile of the business relative to the company's strategic intent and financial underpinning; assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the company's overall risk philosophy; communicating and monitoring the company's risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and providing valuable insight to assist leaders in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines. 10 enterprise risk management structure and governance at the hartford, the board of directors ( the board ) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight. it exercises its oversight function through its standing committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. in addition, the finance, investment and risk management committee ( firmco ), which is comprised of all members of the board, has responsibility for the oversight of the investment, financial, and risk management activities of the company, and oversight of all risk exposures, including those that do not fall within the responsibility of any other standing committee. the audit committee is responsible for, among other things, discussing with management policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. at the corporate level, the company's enterprise chief risk officer ( chief risk officer ) leads erm. the chief risk officer reports directly to the company's chief executive officer ( ceo ). the company has established the enterprise risk and capital committee ( ercc ) that includes the company's ceo, chief financial officer , chief investment officer, chief risk officer, the presidents and chief operating officers of each business segment, and the general counsel. the ercc is responsible for managing the company's risks and overseeing the enterprise risk management program. the ercc also manages the capital structure of the enterprise and is responsible for the attribution of capital to the lines of business. the ercc reports to the board primarily through firmco and through interactions with the audit committee. the company also has committees that manage specific risks and recommend risk mitigation strategies to the ercc. these committees include, but are not limited to, the company and division asset liability committees, catastrophe risk committee, emerging risk committees, model oversight committees and operational risk committee. risk management framework at the company, risk is managed at multiple levels. the hartford utilizes three lines of defense in risk management to integrate its risk management strategy and appetite into all functional areas of the company, the board and senior level risk committees. the first line of defense in risk management is generally the responsibility of the lines of business. senior business leaders are responsible for managing risks specific to their business objectives and business environment. the second line of defense in risk management is generally owned by erm. erm has the responsibility to ensure that the company has insight into its aggregate risk and that risks are managed within the firm's overall risk appetite. legal and compliance also commonly perform second line of defense risk management. the third line of defense in risk management is owned by internal audit. internal audit provides independent assurance services to evaluate the effectiveness of management's controls, informs the risk identification process and provides audit and consultative support to the company. the company's risk management framework consists of five core elements: 1. risk culture and governance: the company has established policies for its major risks and a formal governance structure with leadership oversight and an assignment of accountability and authority. the governance structure starts at the board and cascades to the ercc and then to individual risk committees across the company. in addition, the company promotes a strong risk management culture and high expectations around ethical behavior. 2. risk identification and assessment: through its erm organization, the company has developed processes for the identification, assessment, and, when appropriate, response to internal and external risks to the company's operations and business objectives. risk identification and prioritization has been established within each area, including processes around emerging risks. 3. risk appetite, tolerances, and limits: the company has a formal enterprise risk appetite framework that is approved by the ercc and reviewed by the board. the risk appetite framework includes an enterprise risk appetite statement, risk preferences, risk tolerances and an associated limit structure for each of the company's major risks. these limits, which are encapsulated in formal risk policies, are reviewed by the appropriate governing risk committee. 4. risk management and controls: while the company utilizes the committee structure to elevate risk discussions and decision-making, there are a variety of working groups that provide decisioning and management of risk within determined tolerances and limits. 5. risk reporting and communication: the company monitors its major risks at the enterprise level through a number of enterprise reports, including but not limited to, a monthly risk dashboard, tracking the return on risk-capital across products, and regular stress testing. erm communicates the company's risk exposures to senior and executive management and the board, and reviews key business performance metrics, risk indicators, audit reports, risk/control self-assessments and risk event data. 11 risk exposures and quantification the company quantifies its enterprise insurance and financial risk exposures using multiple lenses including statutory, economic and, where appropriate, u.s. gaap. erm leverages various modeling techniques and metrics to provide a view of the company's risk exposure in both normal and stressed environments. erm regularly monitors the company's risk exposure as compared to defined statutory limits and provides regular reporting to the ercc. in order to quantify group capital levels the company uses an economic capital model ( ecm ) to quantify the value of risk management across the business lines and to advance its risk-based decision-making and optimization across risk and business. the company also uses the ecm to inform the attribution of risk capital to each line of business. the company categorizes its main risks as follows in order to achieve a consistent and disciplined approach to quantifying, evaluating, and managing risk: insurance risk operational risk financial risk additionally, the company manages its business risk, categorized as strategic risk and management risk, at all levels of the organization. strategic risk is defined as the risk to the defined company objectives from adverse developments in the company's strategy vis- -vis changing market conditions and competitor actions. management risk is defined as the risk to defined company objectives from the ineffective or inefficient execution of the company's strategic and business decisions. enterprise strategic and management risks are assessed through strategic, business and operating plan reviews, as well as through management self-assessment processes and benchmarking and is inherently included in the company's evaluation of insurance, operational, and financial risk. insurance risk the company defines insurance risk as its exposure to loss due to property, liability, mortality, morbidity, disability, longevity and other perils and risks covered under its policies, including adverse development on loss reserves supporting its products and geographic accumulations of loss over time due to property or casualty catastrophes. operational risk the company defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. financial risk financial risk is broadly defined by the company to include liquidity, interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, and credit risks, all of which have the potential to materially impact the company's financial condition. financial risk also includes exposure to events that may cause correlated movement in the above risk factors. for further discussion on risk management, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management. regulation insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states. the extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the hartford. this legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department's prior approval. in the jurisdictions in which the company's insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of the hartford's outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory filings. 12 certain of the company's life insurance subsidiaries sold variable life insurance, variable annuity, and some fixed guaranteed products that are securities registered with the sec under the securities act of 1933, as amended. some of the products have separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 act ), and/or are regulated by state law. separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation. moreover, each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund that is also registered as an investment company under the 1940 act ( underlying funds ). the company offers these underlying funds and retail mutual funds that are registered with and regulated by the sec. in addition, other subsidiaries of the company sold and distributed the company's variable insurance products, underlying funds and retail mutual funds as broker-dealers and are subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), the sec and/or in, some instances, state securities administrators. other entities operate as investment advisers registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. one subsidiary is an investment company registered under the 1940 act. because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. some of these regulations include, among other things, regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers' funds, corporate governance, capital, record keeping, and reporting requirements. the extent of insurance regulation on business outside the united states varies significantly among the countries in which the hartford operates. some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate insurers extensively. foreign insurers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. the hartford's international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective countries. in addition, as described under legislative developments, we are subject to a number of dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ) provisions. failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees. we cannot predict the impact of these actions on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. intellectual property we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. we have a trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the hartford name, the stag logo and the combination of these two marks. the duration of trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. we regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. in addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to on-line quoting, insurance related processing, insurance telematics, proprietary interface platforms, and other matters, some of which may be important to our business operations. patents are of varying duration depending on filing date, and will typically expire at the end of their natural term. employees the hartford has

factors, any of which could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford and could also impact the trading price of our securities. the hartford may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties that are not specifically described below, which may have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use, however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance. risks relating to economic, market and political conditions unfavorable conditions in our operating environment, including general economic and global capital market conditions, and financial and capital markets risks, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, market volatility, foreign exchange rates and real estate market deterioration, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. despite the rise in u.s. equity markets in 2013, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of an economic recovery, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2014. weak economic conditions, such as continued high unemployment, low labor force participation, lower family income, higher tax rates, including on small business owners, lower business investment and lower consumer spending have adversely affected or may in the future adversely affect the demand for financial and insurance products, as well as their profitability in some cases. these weak economic conditions are also likely to result in the persistence of a sustained low interest rate environment as well as volatility in other capital market conditions, which will continue to pressure our investment results. one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with our operations in mutual funds and talcott resolution, such as u.s. and japan variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. should global equity markets decline from current levels, assets under management and related fee income will be reduced. certain of our products have guaranteed benefits that increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure should equity markets decline. sustained declines in equity markets may result in the need to utilize significant additional capital to support these products and adversely affect our ability to support our other businesses. while interest rates in recent periods continue to be near historically low levels, recent increases in market rates have marginally reduced our reinvestment risk. however, further reductions in market rates or a sustained low interest rate environment would pressure our net investment income and could result in lower margins and lower estimated gross profits on certain products. in addition, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities within our talcott resolution operations, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long-term interest rates subjects us to reinvestment risks, increased hedging costs, spread compression and capital volatility. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will reduce the market value of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates were to rise dramatically within a six-to-twelve month time period, certain products within our talcott resolution division might be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate in an unrealized loss position. an increase in interest rates can also impact our tax planning strategies and in particular our ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. assets supporting the liabilities within our property &amp; casualty and group benefits businesses are largely invested in fixed income securities. changes in interest rates will affect the value of these assets and expose the company to reinvestment risk and disintermediation risk if cash flows differ materially from our projections. additionally, new and renewal business for these products is priced based on prevailing interest rates. as interest rates decline, pricing targets will increase to offset the lower anticipated investment income earned on invested premiums. conversely, as interest rates rise, pricing targets will decrease to reflect higher anticipated investment income. such changes in pricing may affect our competitiveness in the marketplace, and in turn, written premium and earnings margin achieved. 14 our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. if issuer credit spreads widen significantly and retain historically wide levels over an extended period of time, other-than-temporary impairments and decreases in the market value of our investment portfolio will likely result. in addition, losses may also occur due to the volatility in credit spreads. when credit spreads widen, we incur losses associated with the credit derivatives where the company assumes exposure. when credit spreads tighten, we incur losses associated with derivatives where the company has purchased credit protection. if credit spreads tighten significantly, the company's net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity can make it difficult to value certain of our securities when trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ( mva ) annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the u.s. and japanese libor in japan. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the u.s. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the u.s. or japanese libor in japan, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this has resulted in the past and may result in the future in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product. our primary foreign currency exchange risk is related to certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan variable annuities. the strengthening of the yen compared with other currencies would substantially increase our exposure to pay yen-denominated obligations. in addition, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses from the hedging of yen denominated individual fixed annuity products. our real estate market exposure includes investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations, mortgage and real estate partnerships, and mortgage loans. deterioration in the real estate market has adversely affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in the past. while the real estate market has shown signs of improvement, deteriorating fundamentals (including increases in property vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures) could cause a decline in market values, which would have a negative impact on sources of refinancing, resulting in reduced market liquidity and higher risk premiums. this could result in reductions in market value and impairments of real estate backed securities, a reduction in net investment income associated with real estate partnerships, and increases in our valuation allowance for mortgage loans. significant declines in global equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads, inflation, the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar and euro, or real estate market deterioration, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our hedging assets seek to reduce the net economic sensitivity of our potential obligations from guaranteed benefits to equity market, interest rate, and foreign exchange fluctuations. because of the accounting asymmetries between our economic targets and statutory and gaap accounting, rising equity markets, rising interest rates, or a strengthening of the u.s. dollar may result in statutory or gaap losses. concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated rather than diversified. 15 risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations actual results could materially differ from the analytical models we use to assist our decision making in key areas such as underwriting, capital, hedging, reserving, and catastrophe risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we employ various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, hedging, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk. both proprietary and third party models we use incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of interest rates, capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, currency exchange rates, policyholder behavior, equity markets and inflation, among others. the modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions, which may be stale, incomplete or erroneous. consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. the profitability and financial condition of the company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. if, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or our estimates of the risks we are exposed to prove to be materially inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected. our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company's consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, certain hedge fund investments, and separate account assets. the determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly increasing/decreasing interest rates, rapidly widening/narrowing credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment in determining their fair values and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether a credit and/or non-credit impairment exists and whether an impairment should be recognized in current period earnings or in other comprehensive income. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company currently uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. impairment losses in earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 16 if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company deferred acquisition costs associated with the prior sales of its variable annuity products. while deferred acquisition costs related to the japan block of business were written off in the first quarter of 2013 when the company executed on its hedging strategy, deferred acquisition costs for the u.s. block are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the company evaluates the egps compared to the dac asset to determine if an impairment exists. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") using components of egps. the projection of egps, or components of egps, requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin (including impairments), mortality, benefit utilization, annuitization and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques, as well as the effect of increased surrenders, could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including lapse rates, benefit utilization, surrenders, and annuitization, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb and gmib, which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset or to recognize an impairment of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management's determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains, to offset previously recognized capital losses, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on realized capital losses, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the company to limit risk. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. for some asbestos and environmental claims, we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these longer-tailed exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related periods. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now, but could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 17 financial strength, credit and counterparty risks the amount of statutory capital that we have, and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements, can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market, interest rate and foreign currency conditions, changes in policyholder behavior, changes in rating agency models, and changes in regulations. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital ( rbc ) formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdiction in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of internal reinsurance arrangements, and changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios would generally be expected to increase. however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and increases in rbc requirements, surplus and rbc ratios may not increase when equity markets increase. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, could increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency (including its assessment of the strategic importance of the rated company to the insurance group), general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, at their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency's judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products. 18 our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for a further discussion of potential impacts of ratings downgrades on derivative instruments, including potential collateral calls, see the "capital resources and liquidity - derivative commitments" section of item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities mortgage loans or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities or loans may deteriorate causing these securities or loans to incur losses. our investment portfolio includes securities backed by real estate assets, the value of which may be adversely impacted if conditions in the real estate market significantly deteriorate, including declines in property values and increases in vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures, ultimately resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows for certain securities. the company also has exposure to foreign-based issuers of securities and providers of reinsurance, as well as indirect european exposure resulting from the variable annuity products that it has sold in japan. these foreign issuers include european issuers as well as certain emerging market issuers. despite the recent stabilization in the european market, there are still fundamental structural issues that remain and may result in the re-emergence of fiscal and economic issues. in addition, there has been recent volatility within certain emerging market countries spurred by concerns over the u.s. federal reserve tapering its monetary stimulus, an economic slowdown in china, and the devaluation of certain currencies. further details of the european and certain emerging market private and sovereign issuers held within the investment portfolio and indirect variable annuity exposures can be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - investment portfolio risks and risk management. the company's european based reinsurance arrangements are further described in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - investment portfolio risks and risk management. property value declines and loss rates that exceed our current estimates, as outlined in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - other-than-temporary impairments, or a worsening of global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. to the extent the investment portfolio is not adequately diversified, concentrations of credit risk may exist which could negatively impact the company if significant adverse events or developments occur in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic regions. the company's investment portfolio is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company's stockholders' equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government, and the government of japan. however, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, our investment portfolio's credit concentration risk to issuers could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. for discussion of the company's exposure to credit concentration risk of reinsurers, see the risk factor, we may incur losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. 19 we may incur losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently use reinsurance to reduce the effect of losses that may arise from catastrophes, transfer other risks that can cause unfavorable results of operations, or effect the sale of one line of business to an independent company. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers' credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or dispute their contractual obligations. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. this risk may be magnified by a concentration of reinsurance-related credit risk resulting from the sale of the company's individual life business. further details of such concentration can be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - reinsurance as a risk management strategy - life insurance product reinsurance recoverable. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. reinsurance pricing changes significantly over time, and no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop to the extent possible other alternatives to reinsurance. further, due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables will be due, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations. the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. these obligations include payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends on our capital stock. the connecticut insurance holding company laws limit the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers and require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of dividends above certain levels. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, or deemed commercially domiciled, including foreign jurisdictions with respect to our international operations, generally contain similar, and in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. dividends paid to us by our insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on their cash requirements. for further discussion on dividends from insurance subsidiaries, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - capital resources &amp; liquidity. our rights to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries, for example, upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the ability of holders of our common stock to benefit indirectly from a distribution, are subject to the prior claims of creditors of the applicable subsidiary, except to the extent that we may be a creditor of that subsidiary. holders of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. 20 insurance and product-related risks our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the policyholders that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes, both natural and man-made, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable natural events, including, among others, earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, wind storms, fires, tornadoes, and pandemics. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, explosions or infrastructure failures. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, tornadoes in the midwest and southeast, earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states, and the spread of disease in metropolitan areas. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events have incorporated medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity - reflecting the potential influence of multi-decadal climate patterns within the atlantic. in addition, changing climate conditions across longer time scales, including the potential risk of broader climate change, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the severity of certain natural catastrophe losses across various geographic regions. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and increase the potency of viral pathogens and bacterial outbreaks that can cause pandemics or adverse mortality trends. potential examples of the impact of climate change on catastrophe exposure include, but are not limited to the following: an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere, more frequent brush fires in certain geographies due to prolonged periods of drought, higher incidence of deluge flooding, and the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. additionally, due to such catastrophes, policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. to the extent that loss experience unfolds or models improve, we will seek to reflect any of these changes in the design and pricing of our products. however, the company may be exposed to regulatory or legislative actions that prevent a full accounting of loss expectations in the design or pricing of our products or result in additional risk-shifting to the insurance industry. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity at the time it becomes known. 21 as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge or restrict an insurer's ability to offer or enforce specific policy deductibles. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates or accept additional risk not contemplated in our existing rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state's insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in all of our property and casualty insurance product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. in addition, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our adjustment of our risk management program relating to products we offered with guaranteed benefits to emphasize protection of economic value will likely result in greater statutory and u.s. gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income (loss). some of the in-force business within our talcott resolution operations, especially variable annuities, offer guaranteed benefits which, in the event of a decline in equity markets, would not only result in lower earnings, but will also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we are also subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, including the guaranteed minimum withdrawal gmwb, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ( gmab ), guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and gmib associated with in-force variable annuities. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. however, due to the severe economic conditions experienced in recent years, we adjusted our risk management program to place greater relative emphasis on the protection of economic value. this shift in relative emphasis has resulted in greater statutory and u.s. gaap earnings volatility and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income (loss) in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, higher interest rates, declines in volatility and weakening of the yen against other currencies. while we believe that these actions have improved the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay and, in turn, may need additional capital to support in-force business. we are also subject to the risk that these management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 22 the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 ( tripra ) is also limited. although tripra provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism, those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. under tripra, once our losses exceed 20% of our subject commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 85% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. our estimated deductible under the program is $1.2 billion for 2014. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. moreover, tripra is due to expire at the end of 2014 unless congress takes legislative action to reauthorize it. because many of the insurance policies we write in 2014 have terms that extend beyond the current expiration of tripra, if congress fails to reauthorize tripra, the company may be exposed to substantially higher losses from a terrorist attack than it anticipated. the company may also be required to take actions to reduce its exposure to terrorism risks in the future, which could negatively impact its business. even if congress extends tripra beyond 2014, it could make changes that would negatively impact the company. for example, past reauthorizations have narrowed the insurance lines that are covered under the program. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our results during the period or periods affected and, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks or other geopolitical or military crises, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory and legal risks the impact of regulatory initiatives and legislative developments, including the enactment of the dodd-frank act of 2010, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory initiatives and legislative developments may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. u.s. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities, including the sec, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve"), the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ), the nyse and the financial industry regulatory authority, inc. ( finra ) are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. such measures are likely to lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important companies in particular. such measures could include taxation of financial transactions and restrictions on employee compensation. the dodd-frank act was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. implementation of the dodd-frank act is ongoing and may affect our operations and governance in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the dodd-frank act requires central clearing of, and imposes new margin requirements on, certain derivatives transactions, which increases the costs of our hedging program. other provisions in the dodd-frank act that may impact us include: the new federal insurance office within treasury; the possible adverse impact on the pricing and liquidity of the securities in which we invest resulting from the proprietary trading and market making limitation of the volcker rule; the possible adverse impact on the market for insurance-linked securities, including catastrophe bonds, resulting from the limitations of banking entity involvement in and ownership of certain asset-backed securities transactions; and enhancements to corporate governance, especially regarding risk management. 23 the dodd-frank act vests the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) with the power to designate systemically important institutions, which will be subject to special regulatory supervision and other provisions intended to prevent, or mitigate the impact of, future disruptions in the u.s. financial system. based on its most current financial data, the hartford is below the quantitative thresholds used by the fsoc to determine which nonbank companies merit consideration. however, the fsoc has indicted it will review on a quarterly basis whether nonbank financial institutions meet the metrics for further review. if we were to be designated as a systemically important institution, we could be subject to heightened regulation under the federal reserve, which could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. in addition, we could be subject to assessments to pay for the orderly liquidation of other systemically important financial institutions that have become insolvent. as a result of these requirements, we could incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments involving claim litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or significant changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable law could have a similar effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves, and how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our products appropriately. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could also be adversely affected if judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from current expectations. potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we are subject to extensive u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and can affect our strategy, as well as the demand for and profitability of the products we offer. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. these regulatory regimes are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than insurers, their shareholders and other investors. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing and authorization for lines of business, statutory capital and reserve requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business. in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. for example, the naic and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. the naic has undertaken a solvency modernization initiative focused on updating the u.s. insurance solvency regulation framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. any proposed or future legislation or naic initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. further, because these laws and regulations are complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that our business may not fully comply with a particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal, accounting, or reserving issue or that such regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. the application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may not be consistent with the opinion of state insurance departments. we cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate (primarily the japan financial services agency), which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. 24 these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. see the risk factor, the impact of regulatory initiatives, including the enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. changes in federal or state tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, and could result in our incurring materially higher corporate taxes. higher tax rates may cause small businesses to hire fewer workers and decrease investment in their businesses, including purchasing vehicles, property and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. conversely, if income tax rates decline it could adversely affect the company's ability to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. in addition, the company's tax return reflects certain items, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. there is an increasing risk that, in the context of deficit reduction or overall tax reform, federal and/or state tax legislation could modify or eliminate these items, impacting the company, its investments, investment strategies, and/or its policyholders. although the specific form of any such legislation is uncertain, changes to the taxation of municipal bond interest could materially and adversely impact the value of those bonds, limit our investment choices and depress portfolio yield. elimination of the dividends received deduction or changes to the taxation of reserving methodologies for p&amp;c companies could increase the company's actual tax rate, thereby reducing earnings. moreover, many of the products that the company previously sold benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company previously sold annuity contracts that allowed policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. because the company no longer sells these products, changes in the future taxation of life insurance and/or annuity contracts will not adversely impact future sales. if, however, the treatment of earnings accrued inside an annuity contract was changed prospectively, and the tax-favored status of existing contracts was grandfathered, holders of existing contracts would be less likely to surrender, which would make running off our existing annuity business more difficult. regulatory requirements could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. before a person can acquire control of a u.s. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any such additional information as the insurance commissioner may deem necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders or in the public interest. generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer or its parent company. because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various u.s. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. other laws or required approvals pertaining to one or more of our existing subsidiaries, or a future subsidiary, may contain similar or additional restrictions on the acquisition of control of the company. these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control, including transactions that our board of directors and some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition. u.s. gaap and related financial reporting requirements are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by the relevant authoritative bodies. such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. changes in u.s. gaap and financial reporting requirements, or in the interpretation of u.s. gaap or those requirements, could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. moreover, the sec is currently evaluating international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ) to determine whether ifrs should be incorporated into the financial reporting system for u.s. issuers. certain of these standards could result in material changes to our reported results of operations. 25 other operational risks the success of the realignment of our businesses, our capital management plan, expense reduction initiatives and other actions, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, are subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the success of the realignment of our businesses and our capital management plan remain subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks. we may not achieve all of the benefits we expect to derive from our plan to repurchase $2 billion of our equity and reduce our debt by $656 million over the course of 2014 and 2015 and our decision to focus on our property and casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses, place our individual annuity business into runoff and sell the individual life and retirement plans businesses. our capital management plan is subject to execution risks, including, among others, risks related to market fluctuations and investor interest and potential legal constraints that could delay execution at an otherwise optimal time. there can be no assurance that we will in fact complete our capital management plan over the planned time frame or at all. further, while the company continues to actively consider alternatives for reducing the size and risk of the variable annuity book, opportunities to do so may be limited and any initiatives pursued, which may include divestitures, may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may negatively impact our statutory capital, net income, core earnings or shareholders' equity. initiatives to reduce expenses so that our ongoing businesses remain or become cost efficient may not be successful and we may not be able to reduce corporate and shared services expenses in the manner and on the schedule we currently anticipate. we may take further actions beyond the capital management plan and business realignment, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings that may involve additional uncertainties and risks that negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. our principal competitors are other property and casualty insurers, group benefits providers and mutual funds. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. because of the highly competitive nature of these industries, there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may experience difficulty in marketing, distributing and providing investment advisory services in relation to our products through current and future distribution channels and advisory firms. we distribute our insurance products and mutual funds through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through or in connection with individual third-party arrangements. for example, we market our consumer markets products in part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 2023. our ability to distribute products through affinity partners may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties, including potentially as a result of a strategic transaction or other company initiatives, could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we use computer systems to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems or maintenance. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain third parties, to access our systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, conducting our financial reporting and analysis, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios and hedging programs. 26 systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a terrorist attack or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees and business partners are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed. moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer related penetrations. while, to date, the hartford is not aware of having experienced a material breach of cybersecurity, administrative and technical controls as well as other preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties with whom we interact, impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. in addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to utilize such capabilities in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with regulations enacted by u.s. federal and state governments, the european union, japan or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others. a misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from an employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions are also subject to the risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third party liability and first party insurance coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all loss. our framework for managing operational risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us that could adversely affect our businesses. our business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage operational risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and other activities, many of which are very complex and for some of which we rely on third parties. we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of these activities through a risk control framework encompassing a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. we cannot be completely confident that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks, or that our employees and third-party agents will effectively implement them. management of operational risks can fail for a number of reasons, including design failure, systems failure, failures to perform, cyber security attacks, human error, or unlawful activities on the part of employees or third parties. in the event that our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations. 27 if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing and similar third-party relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third-party vendors to provide certain services on our behalf. as we continue to focus on reducing the expense necessary to support our operations, we have become increasingly committed to outsourcing strategies for certain technology and business functions. we may also seek to reduce coordination costs and take advantage of economies of scale by transitioning multiple functions and services to a small number of third-party providers. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. if our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers, particularly those on which we rely for multiple functions or services, is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations), increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. for other risks associated with our outsourcing of certain functions, see the risk factor, if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, systems, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may be subject to patent claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, systems, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information

i item 1. business (dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated) general the hartford financial services group, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the hartford , the company , we , or our ) is an insurance and financial services company. the hartford, headquartered in connecticut, is among the largest providers of property and casualty insurance and group life and disability products to individual and business customers in the united states of america. the hartford is also a provider of mutual funds to investors and additionally, the hartford continues to manage life and annuity products previously sold. hartford fire insurance company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of the hartford's subsidiaries. at december 31, 2014 , total assets and total stockholders' equity of the hartford were $245 billion and $18.7 billion , respectively. organization the hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry. the company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to consumers and businesses. the company seeks on an ongoing basis to develop and expand its distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies of scale and improved technology, and capitalizes on its brand name and the hartford stag logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry. in 2012, the hartford concluded an evaluation of its strategy and business portfolio. the company is currently focusing on its property &amp; casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses. this realignment positions the organization for higher returns on equity, reduced sensitivity to capital markets, a lower cost of capital and increased financial flexibility. as a result, the company completed the sale of hartford life insurance kk ("hlikk") in 2014 and its retirement plans, individual life and u.k. annuity businesses in 2013. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business dispositions and note 19 - discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, the company sold woodbury financial services, inc. ("woodbury financial services", "wfs"), an indirect wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary, and placed its annuity businesses into runoff in 2012. as a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, the hartford financial services group, inc. has no significant business operations of its own. therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations. additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the hartford financial services group, inc. may be found in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md&amp;a ) capital resources and liquidity. reporting segments the hartford currently conducts business principally in six reporting segments including commercial lines (formerly property &amp; casualty commercial), personal lines (formerly consumer markets), property &amp; casualty other operations, group benefits, mutual funds and talcott resolution, as well as a corporate category. the hartford includes in its corporate category the company's debt financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities; and purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments. the following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of the hartford's reporting segments. for further discussion of the reporting segments, including financial disclosures of revenues by product line, net income (loss), and assets for each reporting segment, see note 4 - segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements. commercial lines principal products and services commercial lines provides businesses with workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, marine and livestock coverages under several different products, primarily throughout the united states, within its standard commercial lines, which consists of the hartford's small commercial and middle market lines of business. additionally, a variety of customized insurance products and risk management services including workers' compensation, automobile, general liability, professional liability, bond, and specialty casualty coverages are offered through the segment's specialty lines. standard commercial lines seeks to offer products with coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder's individualized risk characteristics. for small businesses, those businesses whose annual payroll is under $5 and whose revenue and property values are less than $15 each, property and liability coverages are bundled as part of a single multi-peril package policy marketed under the spectrum name. the small commercial line of business also provides workers' compensation and automobile coverages. medium-sized businesses, companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed the small business definition, are served within middle market. the middle market line of business provides workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, marine and livestock coverages. 5 within the specialty lines, a significant portion of the specialty casualty business, including workers' compensation business, is written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides collateral to support loss payments made within their deductible. the specialty casualty business also provides retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. the captive programs business provides tailored property and casualty programs primarily to customers with common risk characteristics and those seeking a loss sensitive solution. the bond business provides (1) contract surety bonds for general, highway/heavy, trade and specialty contractors; (2) commercial surety required in a variety of businesses and court situations; and (3) fidelity coverage for businesses, financial institutions and public entities. the financial products business provides a suite of management and professional liability insurance products including d&amp;o (directors and officers) and e&amp;o (errors and omissions) liability products. marketing and distribution standard commercial lines provide insurance products and services through the company's home office located in hartford, connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. the products are marketed nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. the current pace of consolidation within the independent agent and broker distribution channel will likely continue such that, in the future a larger proportion of written premium will likely be concentrated among fewer agents and brokers. additionally the company offers insurance products to customers of payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies. specialty lines also provide insurance products and services through its home office located in hartford, connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. specialty lines markets its products nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent retail agents, brokers and wholesalers. competition in the small commercial marketplace, the hartford competes against a number of large national carriers, as well as regional carriers in certain territories. competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. the small commercial market has become increasingly competitive as carriers seek to differentiate themselves through product expansion, price reduction, enhanced service and cutting-edge technology. larger carriers such as the hartford have improved their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with agents through the use of predictive modeling tools and automation which speeds up the process of evaluating a risk and quoting new business. written premium growth rates in the small commercial market have slowed in recent years due to the economy and underwriting margins have been pressured by increased competition. a number of companies have sought to grow their business by increasing their underwriting appetite, appointing new agents and expanding business with existing agents. also, carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more aggressively competing for small commercial accounts as small commercial business has generally been less price-sensitive. middle market business is characterized as high touch and involves case-by-case underwriting and pricing decisions. the pricing of middle market accounts is prone to significant variation or cyclicality over time, with sensitivity to legislative and macro-economic forces. additionally, various state legislative reforms in recent years designed to control workers compensation indemnity costs have led to rate reductions in many states. these factors, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have resulted in more new business opportunities in the marketplace as customers shop their policies for a lower price. in the face of this competitive environment, the hartford continues to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. to gain a competitive advantage in this environment, carriers are improving automation with agents and brokers, increasing pricing sophistication, and enhancing their product offerings. these enhancements include industry specialization, with the hartford and other national carriers tailoring products and services to specific industry verticals such as technology, life sciences, construction and renewable energy. specialty lines is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that operate independently within their specific industries. these businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have different business models and operating cycles. specialty lines competes on an account- by-account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction. competition in this market includes other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the hartford provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. disciplined underwriting and targeted returns are the objectives of specialty lines since premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment's view of perceived market opportunity. for specialty casualty businesses, written pricing competition continues to be significant, particularly for the larger individual accounts. carriers are aggressively negotiating renewals with customers by initiating the renewal process well in advance of the policy renewal date, to improve retention, reducing new business opportunities within the marketplace. within the national account business, as written pricing increases, more insureds may opt for loss-sensitive products in lieu of guaranteed cost policies. in the bond business, favorable underwriting results over the past couple of years have led to increased competition for market share, setting the stage for potential written price decreases. new public construction activity is slowly rebounding from the historically low levels, resulting in slightly higher demand for contract surety business as compared to previous years. 6 carriers writing professional liability business are increasingly focused on profitable private, middle market companies. this trend has continued as the downturn in the economy has led to a significant drop in the number of initial public offerings, and volatility for all public companies. also, carriers' new business opportunities in the marketplace for directors &amp; officers and errors &amp; omissions insurance have been significantly influenced by customer perceptions of financial strength, as investment portfolio losses have had a negative effect on the financial strength ratings of some insurers. in the commercial marketplace, the weak economy has prompted carriers to offer differentiated products and services as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. in addition to the initiatives specific to each of the hartford's commercial lines of business noted above, the company is leveraging its diverse product, service and distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated value in the market, while simultaneously increasing its ability to access its own diverse customer base for new product sales. personal lines principal products and services personal lines provides automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the united states, including a special program designed exclusively for members of aarp ( aarp program ). the hartford's auto and homeowners products provide coverage options and customized pricing tailored to a customer's individual risk. the hartford has individual customer relationships with aarp program policyholders and, as a group, these customers represent a significant portion of the total personal lines' business. business sold to aarp members, either direct or through independent agents, amounted to earned premiums of $3.0 billion , $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. during 2014, personal lines rolled out its new auto product, open road , in 37 states, increasing pricing flexibility and market responsiveness. in addition, personal lines continued to roll out its telematics device, truelane , to more states, and the device is currently available in 40 states to both direct and independent agent customers. the truelane device records the driving data of personal lines' customers, who receive a discount of up to 10% for the initial policy term with the potential for additional discounts upon renewal. marketing and distribution personal lines reaches diverse customers through multiple distribution channels including direct sales to the consumer, brokers and independent agents. in direct sales to the consumer, personal lines markets its products through a mix of media, including direct mail, digital marketing, television and advertising, both digitally and in publications. more recently, personal lines has begun marketing to consumers through online distribution partners who generate leads for the company. through the agency channel, personal lines provides products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market. these independent agents are not employees of the company. most of personal lines' sales are associated with its exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp, with the current agreement in place through january 1, 2023 , to provide automobile, homeowners and and personal umbrella coverages to aarp's nearly 37 million members, either direct or through independent agents. this agreement provides personal lines with an important competitive advantage given the number of baby boomers over age 50 , many of whom become aarp members. during 2014, the company expanded its relationship with aarp to provide its industry-leading small business products offered by commercial lines to aarp members who are small business owners. in addition to selling product through its relationship with aarp and through independent agents, personal lines markets direct to the consumer within select underwriting markets and where we believe we have a competitive advantage. competition the personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete on the basis of price, product, service (including claims handling), stability of the insurer and brand recognition. companies with recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. in recent years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and retain profitable business. this has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the consumer. industry sales of personal lines insurance direct to the consumer have been growing faster than sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance. carriers that distribute products mainly through agents compete by offering agents commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering online and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. a large majority of agents have been using comparative rater tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. the use of comparative rater tools increases price competition. carriers with more efficient cost structures will have an advantage in competing for new business through price. 7 the use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business and carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. some companies, including the hartford, have written a greater percentage of their new business in preferred market segments which tend to have better loss experience but also lower average premiums. in addition, a number of companies have invested in telematics the use of devices in insured vehicles to transmit information about driving behavior such as miles driven, speed, acceleration, deceleration and are using that information to price the risk and drive favorable risk selection. also, new auto technology advancements including lane departure warnings, backup cameras, active collision alerts are being deployed rapidly and are expected to improve driver safety and reduce the likelihood of vehicle collisions. such advancements could reduce loss frequency and therefore average premiums resulting in lower industry premiums and increased competition. companies that are the first to recognize these trends by, for example, introducing vehicle safety discounts or otherwise reflecting these trends in pricing, may enjoy a competitive advantage. group benefits principal products and services group benefits provides group life, accident and disability coverage, group retiree health and voluntary benefits to individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions. group benefits also offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. in addition, group benefits offers a single-company leave management solution, the hartford productivity advantage , which integrates work absence data from the insurer's short-term and long-term group disability and workers' compensation insurance with its leave management administration services. group benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy terms in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, declining interest rates, and other factors. policies are typically sold with one, two or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product and market segment. marketing and distribution the group benefits distribution network is managed through a regional sales office system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. competition group benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. this line of business focuses on both its risk management expertise and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. competitive factors affecting group benefits include the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for coverage and services, the company's relationships with its third-party distributors and private exchanges, and the quality of customer service. in addition, active price competition continues in the marketplace resulting in multi-year rate guarantees being offered to customers. top tier carriers in the marketplace also offer on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the group benefits business provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. mutual funds principal products and services mutual funds provides investment management, administration, distribution and related services to investors through investment products in both domestic and international markets, and is separated into two distinct asset categories referred to as mutual fund funds and talcott funds. mutual fund funds includes equity, fixed income, alternative and asset allocation investment products that are actively sold primarily through retail, bank trust and registered investment advisor channels. talcott funds represents those assets held in separate accounts supporting legacy runoff hartford variable insurance products. wellington management company, llp ("wellington management") serves as sole sub-advisor for mutual funds. marketing and distribution the mutual funds distribution team is organized to sell across a variety of channels including national and regional broker-dealer organizations, independent financial advisors, defined contribution plans, consultants, record keepers, bank trust groups, and registered investment advisors. competition mutual funds competes with other mutual fund companies and investment brokerage companies and differentiates itself through fund performance, product innovation and solutions, and service. 8 talcott resolution talcott resolution is comprised of the runoff of the company's u.s. annuity and institutional and private-placement life insurance businesses, and the retained japan fixed payout annuity liabilities. talcott resolution's mission is to pursue opportunities to reduce the size and risk of the annuity book of business while honoring the company's obligations to its annuity contractholders. talcott resolution manages approximately 930 thousand annuity contracts with account value of approximately $77 billion and private placement life insurance with account value of approximately $40 billion as of december 31, 2014 . in 2014, the company completed the sale of its japan annuity business. the talcott resolution business segment includes our retirement plans and individual life businesses sold in 2013 through reinsurance agreements with the respective buyers. in addition, the company completed the sale of its u.k. annuity business in 2013. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business dispositions and note 19 - discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements. reserves the hartford establishes and carries as liabilities reserves for its insurance products to estimate for the following: a liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, as well as estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims; a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the life insurance policyholder as of the consolidated financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value; a liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; fair value reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and death and living benefit reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. further discussion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reserves, including asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a critical accounting estimates property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance. additional discussion may be found in the company's accounting policies for insurance product reserves within note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements. reinsurance the hartford cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers for both its property and casualty and life insurance products. such arrangements do not relieve the hartford of its primary liability to policyholders. failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the hartford. for further discussion of reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management and note 7 - reinsurance of notes to consolidated financial statements. for property and casualty insurance products, reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater diversification of business and limit the hartford's maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. a major portion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reinsurance is effected under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. the hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses over stipulated amounts. for life insurance products, the hartford is involved in both the cession and assumption of insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. the company has ceded reinsurance in connection with the sales of its retirement plans and individual life businesses in 2013. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business dispositions of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, the company has reinsured to third parties a portion of the risk associated with u.s. individual variable annuities and the associated guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ) riders. 9 investment operations the majority of the company's investment portfolios are managed by hartford investment management company ( himco ). himco manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, and generate the income necessary to support the company's various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. the risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset sector, credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio limits for below investment grade holdings and foreign currency exposure limits. the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the company's results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset diversification, asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. for further discussion of himco's portfolio management approach, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management. in addition to managing the general account assets of the company, himco is also a sec registered investment adviser for a variable insurance trust and third party institutional clients, a sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital markets transactions. himco specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active portfolio management within a disciplined risk framework that seeks to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 , the fair value of himco's total assets under management was approximately $109.5 billion and $112.6 billion , respectively, of which $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion , respectively, were held in himco managed third party accounts. enterprise risk management the company has an enterprise risk management function ( erm ) that is charged with providing analysis of the company's risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the company's risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances. erm plays an integral role at the hartford by fostering a strong risk management culture and discipline. the mission of erm is to support the company in achieving its strategic priorities by: providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the company, including risk concentrations and correlations; helping management define the company's overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk/return profile of the business relative to the company's strategic intent and financial underpinning; assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the company's overall risk philosophy; communicating and monitoring the company's risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and providing insight to assist leaders in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines. enterprise risk management structure and governance at the hartford, the board of directors ( the board ) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight. it exercises its oversight function through its standing committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. in addition, the finance, investment and risk management committee ( firmco ), which is comprised of all members of the board, has responsibility for the oversight of the investment, financial, and risk management activities of the company, except as otherwise provided in the company governance guidelines. the oversight of all risk exposures includes, but is not limited to: market risk, including credit, interest rate, equity market, and foreign exchange; liquidity and capital requirements of the company; insurance risks, including those arising out of catastrophes and acts of terrorism; cybersecurity risk; and any other risk that poses a material threat to the strategic viability of the company. the audit committee is responsible for, among other things, discussing with management policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. 10 at the corporate level, the company's enterprise chief risk officer ( chief risk officer ) leads erm. the chief risk officer reports directly to the company's chief executive officer ( ceo ). the company has established the enterprise risk and capital committee ( ercc ) that includes the company's ceo, president, chief financial officer, chief investment officer, chief risk officer, general counsel and others as deemed necessary by the committee chair. the ercc oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the company. the ercc also oversees capital management and the allocation of capital to the lines of business. the ercc is responsible for significant company-wide risk exposures including, but not limited to, financial risk, liquidity and capital requirements, insurance risk, operational risks, and any other risk deemed significant. the ercc reports to the board primarily through the firmco and through interactions with the audit committee. the company also has committees that manage specific risks and recommend risk mitigation strategies to the ercc. these committees include, but are not limited to, asset liability committees, catastrophe risk committee, emerging risk committees, model oversight committees and operational risk committee. risk management framework at the company, risk is managed at multiple levels. the hartford utilizes three lines of defense in risk management to integrate its risk management strategy and appetite into all areas of the company. the first line of defense in risk management is generally the responsibility of the lines of business. senior business leaders are responsible for managing risks specific to their business objectives and business environment. the second line of defense in risk management is generally owned by erm. erm has the responsibility to ensure that the company has insight into its aggregate risk and that risks are managed within the company's overall risk appetite. legal and compliance also commonly act as a second line of defense in risk management. the third line of defense in risk management is owned by internal audit. internal audit provides independent assurance that each business unit's controls are present, compliant, and effective, informs the risk identification process and provides audit and consultative support to the company. the company's risk management framework consists of five core elements: 1. risk culture and governance: the company has established policies for its major risks and a formal governance structure with leadership oversight and an assignment of accountability and authority. the governance structure starts at the board and cascades to the ercc and then to individual risk committees across the company. in addition, the company promotes a strong risk management culture and high expectations around ethical behavior. 2. risk identification and assessment: through its erm organization, the company has developed processes for the identification, assessment, and, when appropriate, response to internal and external risks to the company's operations and business objectives. risk identification and prioritization has been established within each area, including processes around emerging risks. 3. risk appetite, tolerances, and limits: the company has a formal enterprise risk appetite framework that is approved by the ercc and reviewed by the board. the risk appetite framework includes an enterprise risk appetite statement, risk preferences, risk tolerances and enterprise risk limits. enterprise risk limits which quantify tolerances into specific limits by risk category are defined in underlying enterprise risk policies. 4. risk management and controls: while the company utilizes the committee structure to elevate risk discussions and decision-making, there are a variety of working groups that provide decisioning and management of risk within determined tolerances and limits. erm and the appropriate governing risk committees regularly monitor the company's risk exposure as compared to defined limits and tolerances and provides regular reporting to the ercc. 5. risk reporting and communication: the company monitors its major risks at the enterprise level through a number of enterprise reports, including but not limited to, a monthly risk dashboard, and regular stress testing. erm communicates the company's risk exposures to senior and executive management and the board, and reviews key business performance metrics, risk indicators, audit reports, risk/control self-assessments and risk event data. risk exposures and quantification the company quantifies its enterprise insurance and financial risk exposures using multiple lenses including statutory, economic and, where appropriate, u.s. gaap. erm leverages various modeling techniques and metrics to provide a view of the company's risk exposure in both normal and stressed environments. 11 in order to quantify group capital levels the company uses an economic capital model ( ecm ) to quantify the value of risk management across the business lines and to advance its risk-based decision-making and optimization across risk and business. the company also uses the ecm to inform capital attribution. the company categorizes its main risks as follows in order to achieve a consistent and disciplined approach to quantifying, evaluating, and managing risk: insurance risk operational risk financial risk additionally, the company manages its legal and management risks, across the enterprise. management risk includes strategic risk, the risk of ineffective or inefficient execution of the company's strategy, as well as tax risk and reputational risk. insurance risk the company defines insurance risk as its exposure to loss due to property, liability, mortality, morbidity, disability, longevity and other perils and risks covered under its policies, including adverse development on loss reserves supporting its products and geographic accumulations of loss over time due to property or casualty catastrophes. operational risk the company defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. financial risk financial risk is broadly defined by the company to include liquidity, interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, and credit risks, all of which have the potential to materially impact the company's financial condition. financial risk also includes exposure to events that may cause correlated movement in the above risk factors. for further discussion on risk management, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management. regulation insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states. the extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the hartford. this legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department's prior approval. in the jurisdictions in which the company's insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of the hartford's outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory filings. certain of the company's life insurance subsidiaries sold variable life insurance, variable annuity, and some fixed guaranteed products that are securities registered with the sec under the securities act of 1933, as amended. some of the products have separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 act ), and/or are regulated by state law. separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation. moreover, each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund that is also registered as an investment company under the 1940 act ( underlying funds ). the company offers these underlying funds and retail mutual funds that are registered with and regulated by the sec. 12 in addition, other subsidiaries of the company sold and distributed the company's variable insurance products, underlying funds and retail mutual funds as broker-dealers and are subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), the sec and/or in, some instances, state securities administrators. other entities operate as investment advisers registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. some of these regulations include, among other things, regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers' funds, corporate governance, capital, record keeping, and reporting requirements. the extent of insurance regulation on business outside the united states varies significantly among the countries in which the hartford operates. some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate insurers extensively. foreign insurers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. the hartford's international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective countries. in addition, as described under legislative developments, we are subject to a number of dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ) provisions. failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees. we cannot predict the impact of these actions on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. intellectual property we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. we have a trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the hartford name, the stag logo and the combination of these two marks. the duration of trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. we regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. in addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to on-line quoting, insurance related processing, insurance telematics, proprietary interface platforms, and other matters, some of which may be important to our business operations. patents are of varying duration depending on filing date, and will typically expire at the end of their natural term. employees the hartford has approximately 17,500 employees as of december 31, 2014 . available information the company's internet address is

whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford and could also impact the trading price of our securities. the hartford may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties that are not specifically described below, which may have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use, however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance. risks relating to economic, market and political conditions unfavorable conditions in our operating environment, including general economic and global capital market conditions, including financial and capital markets risks, such as changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, market volatility, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices and real estate market deterioration, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. the company's investment portfolio and insurance liabilities are sensitive to changes in global capital market conditions. stressed conditions or disruptions in global capital markets can directly impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity as well as impact the economic environment. weak economic conditions, such as high unemployment, low labor force participation, lower family income, higher tax rates, lower business investment and lower consumer spending may have adversely affected or may in the future adversely affect the demand for insurance and financial products, as well as their profitability in some cases. weak economic conditions are also likely to result in the persistence of a low interest rate environment as well as volatility in other global capital market conditions, which will continue to pressure our investment results. one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with our operations in mutual funds and talcott resolution, such as u.s. variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. should equity markets decline from current levels, assets under management and related fee income will be reduced. certain of our products have guaranteed benefits that increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure when equity markets decline. sustained declines in equity markets may result in the need to utilize significant additional capital to support these products and adversely affect our ability to support our other businesses. a sustained low interest rate environment would pressure our net investment income and could result in lower margins and lower estimated gross profits on certain products. new and renewal business for our property and casualty and group benefits products is priced based on prevailing interest rates. as interest rates decline, pricing targets will tend to increase to offset the lower anticipated investment income earned on invested premiums. conversely, as interest rates rise, pricing targets will tend to decrease to reflect higher anticipated investment income. such changes in pricing may affect our competitiveness in the marketplace, and in turn, written premium and earnings margin achieved. in addition, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities within our group benefits and talcott resolution operations, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long-term interest rates subjects us to reinvestment risks, increased hedging costs, spread compression and capital volatility. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will reduce the market value of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates were to rise dramatically certain products within our talcott resolution segment might be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. an increase in interest rates can also impact our tax planning strategies and, in particular, our ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to changes in market price of fixed income instruments associated with changes in credit spreads. if issuer credit spreads widen significantly and retain wide levels over an extended period of time, other-than-temporary impairments and decreases in the market value of our investment portfolio will likely result. in addition, losses may also occur due to volatility in credit spreads. when credit spreads widen, we incur losses associated with credit derivatives where the company assumes exposure. when credit spreads tighten, we incur losses associated with derivatives where the company has purchased credit protection. if credit spreads tighten significantly, the company's net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity can make it difficult to value certain of our securities when trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 14 our exposure to commodity prices primarily relates to our investment portfolio. our investment portfolio includes fixed maturities and equity securities issued by companies and sovereigns that derive a portion of their revenues from commodities, including oil, coal, natural gas, precious and non-precious metals. in periods in which the prices of these and other commodities fall, absent other countervailing changes, decreases in the market value of our investment portfolio will likely result. if these declines in commodities prices are severe and persist over an extended period of time, other-than-temporary impairments may result. our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ( mva ) annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the u.s. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the u.s. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the u.s. , the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets, resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this has resulted in the past and may result in the future in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product. our real estate market exposure includes investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations, mortgage and real estate partnerships, and mortgage loans. deterioration in the real estate market has adversely affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in the past. while the real estate market has shown signs of improvement, deteriorating fundamentals (including increases in property vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures) could cause a decline in market values, which would have a negative impact on sources of refinancing, resulting in reduced market liquidity and higher risk premiums. this could result in reductions in market value and impairments of real estate-backed securities, a reduction in net investment income associated with real estate partnerships, and increases in our valuation allowance for mortgage loans. significant declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads, inflation, the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar or real estate market deterioration, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our hedging assets seek to reduce the net economic sensitivity of our potential obligations from guaranteed benefits to equity market and interest rate fluctuations. because of the accounting asymmetries between our hedging targets and statutory and gaap accounting principles for our guaranteed benefits, rising equity markets and/or rising interest rates may result in statutory or gaap losses. concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated rather than diversified. risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations actual results could materially differ from the analytical models we use to assist our decision making in key areas such as underwriting, capital, hedging, reserving, and catastrophe risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we employ various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, hedging, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk. both proprietary and third party models we use incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of interest rates, capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, currency exchange rates, policyholder behavior, equity markets and inflation, among others. the modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions, which may be stale, incomplete or erroneous. consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. the profitability and financial condition of the company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. if, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or our estimates of the risks we are exposed to prove to be materially inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected. 15 our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company's consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, certain hedge fund investments, and separate account assets. the determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly increasing/decreasing interest rates, rapidly widening/narrowing credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment in determining their fair values and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether a credit and/or non-credit impairment exists and whether an impairment should be recognized in current period earnings or in other comprehensive income. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security to determine if a security is other-than-temporarily-impaired. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. impairment losses in earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company deferred acquisition costs associated with the prior sales of its variable annuity products. deferred acquisition costs for the u.s. variable annuity products are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the company evaluates the egps compared to the dac asset to determine if an impairment exists. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and the life contingent portion of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwb") using components of egps. the projection of egps, or components of egps, requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin (including impairments), mortality, benefit utilization, annuitization and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in separate account fund returns are most likely to impact the egp, along with the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques, as well as the effect of increased surrenders, could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including lapse rates, benefit utilization, surrenders, and annuitization, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 16 if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset or to recognize an impairment of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management's determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate capital gains to offset previously recognized capital losses, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on deferred tax assets, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the company to limit risk. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. for some asbestos and environmental claims, we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these longer-tailed exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related periods. depending on the scale of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. financial strength, credit and counterparty risks the amount of statutory capital that we have, and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements, can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market and interest rate conditions, changes in policyholder behavior, changes in rating agency models, and changes in regulations. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital ( rbc ) formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. 17 in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates, the impact of internal reinsurance arrangements, admissibility of deferred tax assets and changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios would generally be expected to increase. however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and increases in rbc requirements, surplus and rbc ratios may not increase when equity markets increase. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, could increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency (including its assessment of the strategic importance of the rated company to the insurance group), general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or other circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency's judgment of its internal rating and the publicly issued rating it assigns us . we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products. our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for a further discussion of potential impacts of ratings downgrades on derivative instruments, including potential collateral calls, see the "capital resources and liquidity - derivative commitments" section of item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities, mortgage loans or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities or loans may deteriorate causing these securities or loans to incur losses. our investment portfolio includes securities backed by real estate assets, the value of which may be adversely impacted if conditions in the real estate market significantly deteriorate, including declines in property values and increases in vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures, ultimately resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows for certain securities. 18 the company also has exposure to foreign-based issuers of securities and providers of reinsurance. these foreign issuers include european and certain emerging market issuers. despite stabilization in the european market, there are still fundamental structural issues that remain and may result in the re-emergence of fiscal and economic issues. in addition, there has been recent volatility within certain emerging market countries spurred by concerns over the potential for rising u.s. interest rates, slowing global growth, lower prices for oil and other commodities, and the devaluation of certain currencies. further details of the european and certain emerging market private and sovereign issuers held within the investment portfolio can be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - investment portfolio risks and risk management. the company's european based reinsurance arrangements are further described in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - investment portfolio risks and risk management. property value declines and loss rates that exceed our current estimates, as outlined in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - other-than-temporary impairments, or a worsening of global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. to the extent the investment portfolio is not adequately diversified, concentrations of credit risk may exist which could negatively impact the company if significant adverse events or developments occur in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic regions. the company's investment portfolio is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company's stockholders' equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government. however, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, our investment portfolio's credit concentration risk to issuers could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. for discussion of the company's exposure to credit concentration risk of reinsurers, see the risk factor, we may incur losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently use reinsurance to reduce the effect of losses that may arise from catastrophes, transfer other risks that can cause unfavorable results of operations, or effect the sale of one line of business to an independent company. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers' credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or dispute their contractual obligations. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. this risk may be magnified by a concentration of reinsurance-related credit risk resulting from the sale of the company's individual life business. further details of such concentration can be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - reinsurance as a risk management strategy - life insurance product reinsurance recoverable. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. reinsurance pricing changes significantly over time, and no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop to the extent possible other alternatives to reinsurance. further, due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables will be due, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations. the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. 19 moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. these obligations include payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends on our capital stock. the connecticut insurance holding company laws limit the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers and require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of dividends above certain levels. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, or deemed commercially domiciled, generally contain similar, and in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. dividends paid to us by our insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on their cash requirements. for further discussion on dividends from insurance subsidiaries, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - capital resources &amp; liquidity. our rights to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries, for example, upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the ability of holders of our common stock to benefit indirectly from a distribution, are subject to the prior claims of creditors of the applicable subsidiary, except to the extent that we may be a creditor of that subsidiary. holders of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. insurance and product-related risks our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the coverage provided to policyholders that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes, both natural and man-made, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable natural events, including, among others, earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, wind storms, fires, tornadoes, and pandemics. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, explosions or infrastructure failures. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, tornadoes in the midwest and southeast, earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states, and the spread of disease. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured employees and property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. in addition, changing climate conditions across longer time scales, including the potential risk of broader climate change, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the severity of certain natural catastrophe losses across various geographic regions.potential examples of the impact of climate change on catastrophe exposure include, but are not limited to the following: an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere, more frequent brush fires in certain geographies due to prolonged periods of drought, higher incidence of deluge flooding, and the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. in addition, our businesses have exposure to global or nationally occurring pandemics caused by highly infectious and potentially fatal diseases, and are spread through human, animal or plant populations. additionally, due to such catastrophes, caused by natural or man-made events, policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies. 20 our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. to the extent that loss experience unfolds or models improve, we will seek to reflect any of these changes in the design and pricing of our products. however, the company may be exposed to regulatory or legislative actions that prevent a full accounting of loss expectations in the design or pricing of our products or result in additional risk-shifting to the insurance industry. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 ( tripra ) is also limited. although tripra provides benefits for certified acts of terrorism that exceed a certain threshold of industry losses ($100 in 2015, increasing to $200 by 2020), those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. under tripra, once our losses exceed 20% of our subject commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us a percentage of our losses (85% in 2015, decreasing 1% annually until 2020) attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. our estimated deductible under the program is $1.19 billion for 2015. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our results during the period or periods affected and, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks or other geopolitical or military crises, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity at the time it becomes known as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. 21 state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge or restrict an insurer's ability to offer or enforce specific policy deductibles. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates or accept additional risk not contemplated in our existing rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state's insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards, more expansive coverage offerings and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards, more coverage restrictions and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in all of our property and casualty insurance product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. in addition, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. adjustments to our risk management program relating to products we offered with guaranteed benefits to emphasize protection of economic value may result in statutory and u.s. gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income (loss). some of the in-force business within our talcott resolution operations, especially variable annuities, offer guaranteed benefits, including gmwb and gmdb which, in the event of a decline in equity markets, would not only result in lower earnings, but will also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. adjustments to our risk management program may result in greater statutory and u.s. gaap earnings volatility and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income (loss) in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, higher interest rates and declines in volatility. while we believe that these actions would improve the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay and, in turn, may need additional capital to support in-force business. we are also subject to the risk that these management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory and legal risks the impact of regulatory initiatives and legislative developments, including the implementation of the dodd-frank act of 2010, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory initiatives and legislative developments may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. u.s. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities, including the sec, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve"), the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ), the nyse and the financial industry regulatory authority, inc. ( finra ) are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. such measures are likely to lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important companies in particular. such measures could include taxation of financial transactions and restrictions on employee compensation. 22 the dodd-frank act was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. implementation of the dodd-frank act is ongoing and may affect our operations and governance in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the dodd-frank act requires central clearing of, and imposes new margin requirements on, certain derivatives transactions, which increases the costs of our hedging program. other provisions in the dodd-frank act that may impact us include: the new federal insurance office within treasury; the possible adverse impact on the pricing and liquidity of the securities in which we invest resulting from the proprietary trading and market making limitation of the volcker rule; the possible adverse impact on the market for insurance-linked securities, including catastrophe bonds, resulting from the limitations of banking entity involvement in and ownership of certain asset-backed securities transactions; and enhancements to corporate governance, especially regarding risk management. the dodd-frank act vests the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) with the power to designate systemically important institutions, which will be subject to special regulatory supervision and other provisions intended to prevent, or mitigate the impact of, future disruptions in the u.s. financial system. based on its most current financial data, the hartford is below the quantitative thresholds used by the fsoc to determine which nonbank companies merit consideration. however, the fsoc has indicted it will review on a quarterly basis whether nonbank financial institutions meet the metrics for further review. if we were to be designated as a systemically important institution, we could be subject to heightened regulation under the federal reserve, which could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. in addition, we could be subject to assessments to pay for the orderly liquidation of other systemically important financial institutions that have become insolvent. as a result of these requirements, we could incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments involving claim litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or significant changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable law could have a similar effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves, and how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our products appropriately. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could also be adversely affected if judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from current expectations. potential changes in regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and can affect our strategy, as well as the demand for and profitability of the products we offer. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. these regulatory regimes are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than insurers, their shareholders and other investors. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing and authorization for lines of business, statutory capital and reserve requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business. in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. for example, the naic and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. the naic has undertaken a solvency modernization initiative focused on updating the u.s. insurance solvency regulation framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. any proposed or future legislation or naic initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. 23 further, because these laws and regulations are complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that our business may not fully comply with a particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal, accounting, or reserving issue or that such regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. the application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may not be consistent with the opinion of state insurance departments. we cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. see the risk factor, the impact of regulatory initiatives, including the enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. changes in federal or state tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, and could result in our incurring materially higher corporate taxes. higher tax rates may cause small businesses to hire fewer workers and decrease investment in their businesses, including purchasing vehicles, property and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. conversely, if income tax rates decline it could adversely affect the company's ability to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. in addition, the company's tax return reflects certain items, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. there is an increasing risk that, in the context of deficit reduction or overall tax reform, federal and/or state tax legislation could modify or eliminate these items, impacting the company, its investments, investment strategies, and/or its policyholders. although the specific form of any such legislation is uncertain, changes to the taxation of municipal bond interest could materially and adversely impact the value of those bonds, limit our investment choices and depress portfolio yield. elimination of the dividends received deduction or changes to the taxation of reserving methodologies for p&amp;c companies could increase the company's actual tax rate, thereby reducing earnings. moreover, many of the products that the company previously sold benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company previously sold annuity contracts that allowed policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. because the company no longer sells these products, changes in the future taxation of life insurance and/or annuity contracts will not adversely impact future sales. if, however, the treatment of earnings accrued inside an annuity contract was changed prospectively, and the tax-favored status of existing contracts was grandfathered, holders of existing contracts would be less likely to surrender, which would make running off our existing annuity business more difficult. regulatory requirements could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. before a person can acquire control of a u.s. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any such additional information as the insurance commissioner may deem necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders or in the public interest. generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer or its parent company. because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various u.s. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. other laws or required approvals pertaining to one or more of our existing subsidiaries, or a future subsidiary, may contain similar or additional restrictions on the acquisition of control of the company. these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control, including transactions that our board of directors and some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. 24 changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition. u.s. gaap and related financial reporting requirements are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by the relevant authoritative bodies. such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. changes in u.s. gaap and financial reporting requirements, or in the interpretation of u.s. gaap or those requirements, could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. moreover, the sec is currently evaluating international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ) to determine whether ifrs should be incorporated into the financial reporting system for u.s. issuers. certain of these standards could result in material changes to our reported results of operations. other operational risks the ability to execute on our capital management plan, expense reduction initiatives and other actions, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, is subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the ability to execute on our capital management plan remains subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks. we may not achieve all of the benefits we expect to derive from our plan to repurchase our equity and reduce our debt. our capital management plan is subject to execution risks, including, among others, risks related to market fluctuations and investor interest and potential legal constraints that could delay execution at an otherwise optimal time. there can be no assurance that we will in fact complete our capital management plan over the planned time frame or at all. initiatives to reduce expenses so that our ongoing businesses remain or become cost efficient may not be successful and we may not be able to reduce corporate and shared services expenses in the manner and on the schedule we currently anticipate. we may take further actions beyond the capital management plan, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, that may involve additional uncertainties and risks that negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. our principal competitors are other property and casualty insurers, group benefits providers and other mutual fund companies. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. because of the highly competitive nature of these industries, there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may experience difficulty in marketing, distributing and providing investment advisory services in relation to our products through current and future distribution channels and advisory firms. we distribute our insurance products and mutual funds through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through or in connection with individual third-party arrangements. for example, we market personal lines products in large part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 1, 2023. our ability to distribute products through affinity partners may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties, including potentially as a result of a strategic transaction or other company initiatives, could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we use computer systems to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems or maintenance. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain third parties, to access our systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, conducting our financial reporting and analysis, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios and hedging programs. 25 systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a terrorist attack (including conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological) or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees and business partners are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed. moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer related penetrations. the frequency and sophistication of such threats continue to increase as well. while, to date, the hartford is not aware of having experienced a material breach of our cybersecurity systems, administrative and technical controls as well as other preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties, with whom we interact, impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. in addition, we routinely transmit, to third parties personal, confidential and proprietary information, which may be related to employees and customers, by email and other electronic means, along with receiving and storing such information on our systems. although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to utilize such capabilities in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with regulations enacted by u.s. federal and state governments, the european union, japan or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others. a misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from an employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, including but not limited to third party administrators, are also subject to cyber-breaches of confidential information, along with the other risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third party liability and first party insurance coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all loss. our framework for managing operational risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us that could adversely affect our businesses. our business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage operational risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and other activities, many of which are very complex and for some of which we rely on third parties. in addition, information technology investments we have made or plan to make in order to improve our operations are subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks which may adversely impact our ability to achieve the anticipated business growth, expense reduction and operational efficiencies. we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of these activities through a risk control framework encompassing a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. we cannot be completely confident that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks, or that our employees and third-party agents will effectively implement them. management of operational risks can fail for a number of reasons, including design failure, systems failure, failures to perform, cyber security attacks, human error, or unlawful activities on the part of employees or third parties. in the event that our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations. 26 if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing and similar third-party relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third-party vendors to provide certain services on our behalf. as we continue to focus on reducing the expense necessary to support our operations, we have become increasingly committed to outsourcing strategies for certain technology and business functions. we have also taken action to reduce coordination costs and take advantage of economies of scale by transitioning multiple functions and services to a small number of third-party providers. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. if our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers, particularly those on which we rely for multiple functions or services, is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations), increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. for other risks associated with our outsourcing of certain functions, see the risk factor, if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, systems, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may be subject to patent claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, systems, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is set forth in the enterprise risk management section of item 7,

amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated) general the hartford financial services group, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the hartford , the company , we , or our ) is a holding company for a group of subsidiaries that provide property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds to individual and business customers in the united states and continues to administer life and annuity products previously sold. the hartford is headquartered in connecticut and its oldest subsidiary, hartford fire insurance company, dates to 1810. at december 31, 2015 , total assets and total stockholders' equity of the hartford were $228 billion and $17.6 billion , respectively. organization the hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry. the company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to individuals and businesses. the company seeks on an ongoing basis to develop and expand its distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies of scale and investments in technology, and capitalize on the strength of its brand, including the hartford stag logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry. as a holding company, the hartford financial services group, inc. is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and has no significant business operations of its own. therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations, pay dividends and repurchase common stock. information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the hartford financial services group, inc. may be found in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md&amp;a ) capital resources and liquidity. reporting segments the hartford conducts business principally in six reporting segments including commercial lines, personal lines, property &amp; casualty other operations, group benefits, mutual funds and talcott resolution, as well as a corporate category. the hartford includes in its corporate category the company's capital raising activities (including debt financing and related interest expense), purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments. the following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of the hartford's reporting segments. for further discussion of the reporting segments, including financial disclosures of revenues by product line, net income (loss), and assets for each reporting segment, see note 3 - segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements. commercial lines principal products and services commercial lines provides workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, marine and livestock insurance products to businesses, primarily throughout the united states. the commercial lines segment includes three lines of business: small commercial; middle market; and specialty. the majority of commercial lines written premium is generated by small commercial and middle market, which provide coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder's individualized risk characteristics. specialty provides a variety of customized insurance products and services including workers' compensation, automobile, general liability, professional liability, bond, and specialty casualty coverages. small commercial provides workers' compensation, automobile, property and liability coverages for small businesses. the company considers small businesses those with annual payroll under $12, revenues under $25 and property values less than $20 per location. property and liability coverages are offered as part of a single package policy, marketed under the spectrum name. middle market provides medium-sized businesses, which are companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed the small business definition, with workers' compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, marine and livestock coverages. within specialty, a significant portion of the business is written through large deductible programs for national accounts. the business also provides retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. the financial products business provides management and professional liability products including d&amp;o (directors and officers) and e&amp;o (errors and omissions) insurance. the bond business provides businesses with contract surety bonds, commercial surety and fidelity coverage. the captive programs business provides tailored programs primarily to customers with common risk characteristics and those seeking a loss sensitive solution. 5 marketing and distribution commercial lines provide insurance products and services through the company's domestic offices and insurance centers. the products are marketed nationally utilizing independent agents, brokers and wholesalers. the independent agent and broker distribution channel is consolidating and this trend is expected to continue. this will likely result in a larger proportion of written premium being concentrated among fewer agents and brokers. in addition, the company offers insurance products to customers of payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies and to members of affinity organizations. competition in small commercial, the hartford competes against large national carriers, as well as regional carriers in certain territories. competitors include stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. the small commercial market is competitive as carriers seek to differentiate themselves through product expansion, price reduction, enhanced service and cutting-edge technology. larger carriers such as the hartford have improved their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with agents and customers through the use of technology, analytics and other capabilities that improve the process of evaluating a risk, quoting new business and servicing customers. the company is also adding to its digital capabilities as customers and distributors demand more access and convenience, and expanding product and underwriting capabilities to accommodate both larger accounts and a broader risk appetite. written premium growth rates have been low for the insurance industry in the small commercial market due to weak economic conditions. this has put pressure on underwriting margins as competitors seek new business by increasing their underwriting appetite, and deepening their relationships with distribution partners. also, carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more aggressively competing for small commercial accounts, which are generally less price-sensitive. middle market business is considered high touch and involves individualized underwriting and pricing decisions. the pricing of middle market accounts is prone to significant variation or cyclicality over time due to changes in individual account characteristics and exposure, as well as legislative and macro-economic forces. in addition, various state legislative reforms in recent years designed to control workers compensation indemnity costs have led to rate reductions in many states. these factors, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have resulted in more customers shopping their policies for a lower price. in the face of this competitive environment, the hartford is working to deepen its product and underwriting capabilities, and leverage its sales and underwriting talent with tools it has introduced in recent years. through advanced training and analytics, the company's field underwriters are working to improve risk selection and pricing decisions. in product development, and related areas such as claims and risk engineering, the company is extending its capabilities in industry verticals, such as construction, auto parts manufacturing and hospitality. the company has also added new middle market underwriters into the midwest and western u.s. to deepen relationships with its distribution partners. specialty competes on an account- by-account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction. competition in this market includes stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. the hartford's relatively large size and underwriting capacity is a competitive advantage over smaller insurance companies. for specialty casualty businesses, written pricing competition continues to be significant, particularly for the larger individual accounts. carriers are aggressively negotiating renewals with customers by initiating the process in advance of the policy renewal date to improve retention and reduce new business opportunities for competitors. as written pricing increases, more insureds may opt for the loss-sensitive products offered in our national accounts segment, including retrospectively rated contracts, in lieu of guaranteed cost policies. within national accounts, the company is planning to introduce a new risk management platform, allowing customers better access to claim data and other information needed by corporate risk managers. this investment will allow the company to work more closely with customers to improve long-term account performance. in the bond business, favorable underwriting results in recent years have led to increased competition for market share, setting the stage for potential written price decreases. public construction project work has slowed, resulting in only modest growth for contract surety business. in professional liability, large and medium-sized businesses are in differing competitive environments. large public d&amp;o, specifically excess layers, is under significant competitive price pressure. the middle market private management liability segment is in a more stable competitive and pricing environment. 6 personal lines principal products and services personal lines provides automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the united states, including a program designed exclusively for members of aarp ( aarp program ). the hartford's auto and homeowners products provide coverage options and pricing tailored to a customer's individual risk. the hartford has individual customer relationships with aarp program policyholders and, as a group, they represent a significant portion of the total personal lines' business. business sold to aarp members, either direct or through independent agents, amounted to earned premiums of $3.2 billion , $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. during 2015, personal lines completed the rollout of its new auto product, open road , which is now available in 44 states. the open road product increases pricing flexibility and market responsiveness, and continues to be refined based on experience. in addition, personal lines has rolled out its telematics program, truelane , to more states, and the program is currently available to customers in 44 states in both the direct and independent agent channels. marketing and distribution personal lines reaches diverse customers through multiple distribution channels, including direct-to-consumer and independent agents. in direct-to-consumer, personal lines markets its products through a mix of media, including direct mail, digital marketing, television and advertising, both digitally and in publications. through the agency channel, personal lines provides products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market, primarily serving mature, preferred consumers. these independent agents are not employees of the company. personal lines has made significant investments in offering direct and agency-based customers the opportunity to interact with the company online, including via mobile devices. in addition, its technology platform for telephone sales centers enables sales representatives to provide an enhanced customer experience, positioning the hartford to offer unique capabilities to aarp's member base. most of personal lines' sales are associated with its exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp, with the current agreement in place through january 1, 2023 , to market automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to aarp's nearly 38 million members, either direct or through independent agents. this agreement provides personal lines with an important competitive advantage given the expected growth of the population of those over age 50 and the strength of the aarp brand. the company has expanded its relationship with aarp to provide its industry-leading small business products offered by commercial lines to aarp members who are small business owners. in addition to selling product through its relationship with aarp, personal lines sells products to non-aarp customers, primarily through the independent agent channel and within select underwriting markets where we believe we have a competitive advantage. competition the personal lines automobile and homeowners insurance markets are highly competitive. personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete on the basis of price, product, service (including claims handling), stability of the insurer and brand recognition. companies with recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. in recent years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and retain profitable business. this has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the consumer. industry sales of personal lines insurance direct to the consumer have been growing faster than sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance. carriers that distribute products mainly through agents compete by offering agents commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering online and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. a large majority of agents have been using comparative rater tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. the use of comparative rater tools increases price competition. carriers that are able to differentiate their offering and work with agents to identify value beyond price are more likely to be successful in this market. the use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business, and carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. some companies, such as the hartford, have written a greater percentage of their new business in preferred market segments. such segments tend to have better loss experience but also have lower average premiums. also, new auto technology advancements including lane departure warnings, backup cameras, automatic braking and active collision alerts are being deployed rapidly and are expected to improve driver safety and reduce the likelihood of vehicle collisions. the hartford is one of the first companies to introduce a vehicle safety discount to consumers whose vehicle is equipped with new safety-promoting technology. 7 in personal lines, the company is investing in capabilities to better utilize data and analytics, and thereby, refine and manage underwriting and pricing. the company is also working to maximize the value of its long-term partnership with aarp. investments in digital tools, contact center capabilities and direct marketing efficiencies are designed to attract and retain more aarp members. the hartford will leverage its agency channel to target aarp members and other customer segments that value the expertise of agents who actively seek the benefits of the hartford's product suite and who value its service model. group benefits principal products and services group benefits provides group life, accident and disability coverage and group retiree health benefits to members of employer groups, associations, and affinity groups. in addition to employer paid coverages, group benefits offers voluntary product coverages including accident, life, disability and critical illness coverages through employee payroll deductions. group benefits also offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. in addition, group benefits offers a single-company leave management solution, the hartford productivity advantage , which integrates work absence data from the insurer's short-term and long-term group disability and workers' compensation insurance with its leave management administration services. group benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy terms in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, declining interest rates, and other factors. policies are typically sold with one, two or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product and market segment. marketing and distribution the group benefits distribution network is managed through a regional sales office system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. additionally, group benefits has relationships with several private exchanges which offer group benefits products to employer groups. competition group benefits competes with numerous insurance companies and financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. this line of business focuses on both its risk management expertise and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. competitive factors affecting group benefits include the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for coverage and services, the company's relationships with its third-party distributors and private exchanges, and the quality of customer service. in addition, active price competition continues in the marketplace resulting in multi-year rate guarantees being offered to customers. top tier carriers in the marketplace also offer on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the group benefits business provides a competitive advantage over smaller companies. additionally, as employers continue to focus on reducing the cost of employee benefits, the shift to employee paid products will become greater. competitive factors affecting the sale of voluntary products include the breadth of products, product education, enrollment capabilities, and overall customer service. in group benefits, the company is working to grow revenue from both its employer group product offerings as well as its voluntary product suite, which includes disability flex, critical illness, and accident coverages. the company's enhanced enrollment and marketing tools help individual participants make sound decisions for their unique benefit needs. mutual funds principal products and services mutual funds provides investment management, administration, distribution and related services to investors through investment products in both domestic and international markets, and is separated into two distinct asset categories referred to as mutual fund assets under management and talcott assets under management. mutual fund assets under management includes equity, fixed income, alternative and asset allocation investment products that are actively sold primarily through retail, bank trust and registered investment advisor channels. talcott assets under management represents those assets held in separate accounts supporting legacy runoff hartford variable insurance products. marketing and distribution the mutual funds distribution team is organized to sell across a variety of channels including national and regional broker-dealer organizations, independent financial advisors, defined contribution plans, consultants, record keepers, bank trust groups, and registered investment advisors. competition mutual funds competes with other mutual fund companies and investment brokerage companies and differentiates itself through fund performance, product innovation and solutions, and service. 8 talcott resolution talcott resolution is comprised of the runoff of the company's u.s. annuity, institutional and private-placement life insurance businesses, and the retained yen denominated fixed payout annuity liabilities. talcott resolution's mission is to efficiently manage the runoff of the business while honoring the company's obligations to its contractholders. talcott resolution manages approximately 852 thousand annuity contracts with account value of approximately $67 billion and private placement life insurance with account value of approximately $40 billion as of december 31, 2015 . the talcott resolution business segment also includes our retirement plans and individual life businesses sold in 2013 through reinsurance agreements with the respective buyers. in 2014, the company completed the sale of hartford life insurance kk, a japanese company ("hlikk"). in addition, the company completed the sale of its u.k. annuity business in 2013. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 18 - discontinued operations and business dispositions of notes to consolidated financial statements. reserves the hartford establishes and carries as liabilities reserves for its insurance products to estimate for the following: a liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, as well as estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims; a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the life and annuity insurance policyholder as of the consolidated financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value; a liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; fair value reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and death and living benefit reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. further discussion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reserves, including asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a critical accounting estimates property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance. additional discussion may be found in the company's accounting policies for insurance product reserves within note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements. reinsurance the hartford cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers for both its property and casualty and life insurance products. such arrangements do not relieve the hartford of its primary liability to policyholders. failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the hartford. for further discussion of reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management and note 5 - reinsurance of notes to consolidated financial statements. for property and casualty insurance products, reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater diversification of business and limit the hartford's maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. a major portion of the hartford's property and casualty insurance product reinsurance is effected under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. the hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses over stipulated amounts. for life insurance products, the hartford is involved in both the cession and assumption of insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. the company has ceded reinsurance in connection with the sales of its retirement plans and individual life businesses in 2013. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 18 - discontinued operations and business dispositions of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, the company has reinsured to third parties a portion of the risk associated with u.s. individual variable annuities and the associated guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ) riders. 9 investment operations the majority of the company's investment portfolios are managed by hartford investment management company ( himco ). himco manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, and generate the returns necessary to support the company's various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. the risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset sector, credit issuer allocation limits, and maximum portfolio limits for below investment grade holdings. the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the company's results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset diversification, asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. for further discussion of himco's portfolio management approach, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a enterprise risk management. in addition to managing the general account assets of the company, himco is also a sec registered investment adviser for a variable insurance trust and third party institutional clients, a sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital markets transactions. himco specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active portfolio management within a disciplined risk framework that seeks to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. in january 2016, himco announced the decision to no longer pursue new business in institutional separate accounts. the change is not expected to have a significant impact on the company's financial position or results of operations. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , the fair value of himco's total assets under management was approximately $102.9 billion and $109.5 billion , respectively, of which $5.4 billion and $6.2 billion , respectively, were held in himco managed third party accounts. enterprise risk management the company has an enterprise risk management function ( erm ) that is charged with providing analysis of the company's risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the company's risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances. erm plays an integral role at the hartford by fostering a strong risk management culture and discipline. the mission of erm is to support the company in achieving its strategic priorities by: providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the company, including risk concentrations and correlations; helping management define the company's overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk/return profile of the business relative to the company's strategic intent and financial underpinning; assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the company's overall risk philosophy; communicating and monitoring the company's risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and providing insight to assist leaders in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines. enterprise risk management structure and governance at the hartford, the board of directors ( the board ) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight. it exercises its oversight function through its standing committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. in addition, the finance, investment and risk management committee ( firmco ), which is comprised of all members of the board, has responsibility for the oversight of the investment, financial, and risk management activities of the company, except as otherwise provided in the company governance guidelines. the oversight of all risk exposures includes, but is not limited to: market risk, including credit, interest rate, equity market, and foreign exchange; liquidity and capital requirements of the company; insurance risks, including those arising out of catastrophes and acts of terrorism; cybersecurity risk; and any other risk that poses a material threat to the strategic viability of the company. the audit committee is responsible for, among other things, discussing with management policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. 10 at the corporate level, the company's enterprise chief risk officer ( chief risk officer ) leads erm. the chief risk officer reports directly to the company's chief executive officer ( ceo ). the company has established the enterprise risk and capital committee ( ercc ) that includes the company's ceo, president, chief financial officer, chief investment officer, chief risk officer, general counsel and others as deemed necessary by the committee chair. the ercc oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the company. the ercc also oversees capital management and the allocation of capital to the lines of business. the ercc is responsible for significant company-wide risk exposures including, but not limited to, financial risk, liquidity and capital requirements, insurance risk, operational risks, and any other risk deemed significant. the ercc reports to the board primarily through the firmco and through interactions with the audit committee. the company also has committees that manage specific risks and recommend risk mitigation strategies to the ercc. these committees include, but are not limited to, asset liability committees, catastrophe risk committee, emerging risk committees, model oversight committees and the operational risk committee. risk management framework at the company, risk is managed at multiple levels. the hartford utilizes three lines of defense in risk management to integrate its risk management strategy and appetite into all areas of the company. the first line of defense in risk management is generally the responsibility of the lines of business. senior business leaders are responsible for managing risks specific to their business objectives and business environment. the second line of defense in risk management is generally owned by erm. erm has the responsibility to ensure that the company has insight into its aggregate risk and that risks are managed within the company's overall risk appetite. legal and compliance also commonly act as a second line of defense in risk management. the third line of defense in risk management is owned by internal audit. internal audit provides independent assurance that each business unit's controls are present, compliant, and effective, informs the risk identification process and provides audit and consultative support to the company. the company's risk management framework consists of five core elements: 1. risk culture and governance: the company has established policies for its major risks and a formal governance structure with leadership oversight and an assignment of accountability and authority. the governance structure starts at the board and cascades to the ercc and then to individual risk committees across the company. in addition, the company promotes a strong risk management culture and high expectations around ethical behavior. 2. risk identification and assessment: through its erm organization, the company has developed processes for the identification, assessment, and, when appropriate, response to internal and external risks to the company's operations and business objectives. risk identification and prioritization has been established within each risk area, including processes around emerging risks. 3. risk appetite, tolerances, and limits: the company has a formal enterprise risk appetite framework and policy that is approved by the ercc and reviewed by the board. the risk appetite framework includes an enterprise risk appetite statement, risk preferences, risk tolerances and enterprise risk limits. enterprise risk limits which quantify tolerances into specific limits by risk category are defined in underlying enterprise risk policies. 4. risk management and controls: while the company utilizes the committee structure to elevate risk discussions and decision-making, there are a variety of working groups that provide decisioning and management of risk within determined tolerances and limits. erm and the appropriate governing risk committees regularly monitor the company's risk exposure as compared to defined limits and tolerances and provide regular reporting to the ercc and firmco. 5. risk reporting and communication: the company monitors its major risks at the enterprise level through a number of enterprise reports, including but not limited to, a monthly risk dashboard, and regular stress testing. erm communicates the company's risk exposures to senior and executive management and the board, and reviews key business performance metrics, risk indicators, audit reports, risk/control self-assessments and risk event data. risk exposures and quantification the company quantifies its enterprise insurance and financial risk exposures using multiple lenses including statutory, economic and, where appropriate, u.s. gaap. erm leverages various modeling techniques and metrics to provide a view of the company's risk exposure in both normal and stressed environments. 11 in order to quantify group capital levels the company uses an economic capital model ( ecm ) to quantify the value of diversification across the business lines and to advance its risk-based decision-making and optimization across risk and business. the company also uses the ecm to inform capital attribution across the businesses. the company categorizes its main risks as follows in order to achieve a consistent and disciplined approach to quantifying, evaluating, and managing risk: insurance risk operational risk financial risk additionally, the company manages its legal and management risks across the enterprise. management risk includes strategic risk, the risk of ineffective or inefficient execution of the company's strategy, as well as tax risk and reputational risk. insurance risk the company defines insurance risk as its exposure to loss due to property, liability, mortality, morbidity, disability, longevity and other perils and risks covered under its policies, including adverse development on loss reserves supporting its products and geographic accumulations of loss over time due to natural catastrophes, casualty catastrophes, terrorism and pandemic events. operational risk the company defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. financial risk financial risk is broadly defined by the company to include liquidity, interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, and credit risks, all of which have the potential to materially impact the company's financial condition. financial risk also includes exposure to events that may cause correlated movement in the above risk factors. for further discussion on risk management, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management. regulation insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states. the extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the hartford. this legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department's prior approval. in the jurisdictions in which the company's insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of the hartford's outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory filings. certain of the company's life insurance subsidiaries sold variable life insurance, variable annuity, and some fixed guaranteed products that are securities registered with the sec under the securities act of 1933, as amended. some of the products have separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 act ), and/or are regulated by state law. separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation. moreover, each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund that is also registered as an investment company under the 1940 act ( underlying funds ). the company offers these underlying funds and retail mutual funds that are registered with and regulated by the sec. 12 in addition, other subsidiaries of the company sold and distributed the company's variable insurance products, underlying funds and retail mutual funds as broker-dealers and are subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), the sec and/or in, some instances, state securities administrators. other entities operate as investment advisers registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. some of these regulations include, among other things, regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers' funds, corporate governance, capital, record keeping, and reporting requirements. the hartford operates in limited foreign jurisdictions. the extent of financial services regulation on business outside the united states varies significantly among the countries in which the hartford operates. some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate financial services providers extensively. foreign financial services providers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. in addition, as described under legislative developments, we are subject to a number of dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ) provisions. failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees. we cannot predict the impact of these actions on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. intellectual property we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. we have a trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the hartford name, the stag logo and the combination of these two marks. the duration of trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. we regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. in addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to on-line quoting, insurance related processing, insurance telematics, proprietary interface platforms, and other matters, some of which may be important to our business operations. patents are of varying duration depending on filing date, and will typically expire at the end of their natural term. employees the hartford has approximately 17,400 employees as of december 31, 2015 . available information the company's internet address is

whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford and could also impact the trading price of our securities. the hartford may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties that are not specifically described below, which may have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use, however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance. risks relating to economic, market and political conditions unfavorable conditions in our operating environment, including general economic and global capital market conditions, such as changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, market volatility, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices and real estate market deterioration, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. the company's investment portfolio and insurance liabilities are sensitive to changes in global capital market conditions. stressed conditions or disruptions in global capital markets can directly impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity as well as impact the economic environment. weak economic conditions, such as high unemployment, low labor force participation, lower family income, higher tax rates, lower business investment and lower consumer spending may have adversely affected or may in the future adversely affect the demand for insurance and financial products, as well as their profitability in some cases. global economic conditions may result in the persistence of a low interest rate environment as well as volatility in other global capital market conditions, which will continue to pressure our investment results. one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with our operations in mutual funds and talcott resolution, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. should equity markets decline from current levels, assets under management and related fee income will be reduced. certain of our products have guaranteed benefits that increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure when equity markets decline. sustained declines in equity markets may result in the need to utilize significant additional capital to support these products and adversely affect our ability to support our other businesses. a sustained low interest rate environment would pressure our net investment income and could result in lower margins and lower estimated gross profits on certain products. new and renewal business for our property and casualty and group benefits products is priced based on prevailing interest rates. as interest rates decline, pricing targets will tend to increase to offset the lower anticipated investment income earned on invested premiums. conversely, as interest rates rise, pricing targets will tend to decrease to reflect higher anticipated investment income. our ability to effectively react to such changes in pricing may affect our competitiveness in the marketplace, and in turn, written premium and earnings margin achieved. in addition, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities within our group benefits and talcott resolution operations, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long-term interest rates subjects us to reinvestment risks, increased hedging costs, spread compression and capital volatility. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will reduce the market value of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates were to rise dramatically certain products within our talcott resolution segment might be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. an increase in interest rates can also impact our tax planning strategies and, in particular, our ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to changes in market price of fixed income instruments associated with changes in credit spreads. if issuer credit spreads widen significantly and remain at wide levels over an extended period of time, other-than-temporary impairments and decreases in the market value of our investment portfolio will likely result. in addition, losses may also occur due to volatility in credit spreads. when credit spreads widen, we incur losses associated with credit derivatives where the company assumes exposure. when credit spreads tighten, we incur losses associated with derivatives where the company has purchased credit protection. if credit spreads tighten significantly, the company's net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. 14 our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ( mva ) annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates , the calculation of statutory reserves may not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets, resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity can make it difficult to value certain of our securities when trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our exposure to commodity prices primarily relates to our investment portfolio. our investment portfolio includes fixed maturities and equity securities issued by companies and sovereigns that derive a portion of their revenues from commodities, including oil, coal, natural gas, and precious and non-precious metals. in periods in which the prices of these and other commodities fall, absent other countervailing changes, decreases in the market value of our investment portfolio will likely result. if these declines in commodities prices are severe and persist over an extended period of time, other-than-temporary impairments may result. significant declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads, inflation, or real estate market deterioration, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. our hedging assets seek to reduce the net economic sensitivity of our potential obligations from guaranteed benefits to equity market and interest rate fluctuations. because of the accounting asymmetries between our hedging targets and statutory and gaap accounting principles for our guaranteed benefits, rising equity markets and/or rising interest rates may result in statutory or gaap losses. concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated rather than diversified. risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations actual results could materially differ from the analytical models we use to assist our decision making in key areas such as underwriting, capital, hedging, reserving, and catastrophe risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we employ various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our insurance businesses, investments and capital management. we use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to, among other things, underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investments, hedging, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk. both proprietary and third party models we use incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of interest rates, capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, currency exchange rates, policyholder behavior, equity markets and inflation, among others. the modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions, which may be stale, incomplete or erroneous. consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. the profitability and financial condition of the company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. if, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or our estimates of the risks we are exposed to prove to be materially inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected. 15 our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company's consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, certain hedge fund investments, and separate account assets. the determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly increasing/decreasing interest rates, rapidly widening/narrowing credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment in determining their fair values and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether a credit and/or non-credit impairment exists and whether an impairment should be recognized in current period earnings or in other comprehensive income. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security to determine if a security is other-than-temporarily-impaired. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. impairment losses in earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death and withdrawal benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company deferred acquisition costs associated with the prior sales of its variable annuity products. deferred acquisition costs for the variable annuity products are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the company evaluates the egps compared to the dac asset to determine if an impairment exists. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and the life contingent portion of gmwb using components of egps. the projection of egps, or components of egps, requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin (including impairments), mortality, benefit utilization, annuitization and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in separate account fund returns are most likely to impact the egp, along with the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques, as well as the effect of increased surrenders, could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including lapse rates, benefit utilization, surrenders, annuitization, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb and life-contingent gmwb which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 16 if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset or to recognize an impairment of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and carryforwards for foreign tax credits, capital losses, net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. factors in management's determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies, sufficient future taxable income and capital gains before net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards expire. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on deferred tax assets, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted if new business, customer retention, profitability or other drivers of performance differ from expectations. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. for some asbestos and environmental claims, we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. in addition, the assumptions used to estimate reserves for asbestos and environmental claims are subject to significant uncertainty, including assumptions about claim frequency, average severity and how insurance coverage applies. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these longer-tailed exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related periods. depending on the scale of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. financial strength, credit and counterparty risks the amount of statutory capital that we have, and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements, can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market and interest rate conditions, changes in policyholder behavior, changes in rating agency models, and changes in regulations. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital ( rbc ) formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. 17 in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries, the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, the amount of dividends or distributions taken out of our insurance subsidiaries, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates, the impact of internal reinsurance arrangements, admissibility of deferred tax assets and changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios would generally be expected to increase. however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, statutory reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and increases in rbc requirements, surplus and rbc ratios may not increase when equity markets increase. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, could increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency (including its assessment of the strategic importance of the rated company to the insurance group), general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or other circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency's judgment of its internal rating and the publicly issued rating it assigns us . we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products. our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for a further discussion of potential impacts of ratings downgrades on derivative instruments, including potential collateral calls, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - capital resources and liquidity - derivative commitments. losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities, mortgage loans or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities or loans may deteriorate causing these securities or loans to incur losses. our investment portfolio includes securities backed by real estate assets, the value of which may be adversely impacted if conditions in the real estate market significantly deteriorate, including declines in property values and increases in vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures, ultimately resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows for certain securities. 18 the company also has exposure to foreign-based issuers of securities and providers of reinsurance. these foreign issuers include european and certain emerging market issuers. despite stabilization in the european market, there are still fundamental structural issues that remain and may result in the re-emergence of fiscal and economic issues. in addition, there has been recent volatility within certain emerging market countries spurred by concerns over the potential for rising u.s. interest rates, slowing global growth, lower prices for oil and other commodities, and the devaluation of certain currencies. further details of the european and certain emerging market private and sovereign issuers held within the investment portfolio and the company's european based reinsurance arrangements can be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - investment portfolio risks and risk management. property value declines and loss rates that exceed our current estimates, as outlined in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - other-than-temporary impairments, or a worsening of global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. to the extent the investment portfolio is not adequately diversified, concentrations of credit risk may exist which could negatively impact the company if significant adverse events or developments occur in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic regions. the company's investment portfolio is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company's stockholders' equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government. however, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, our investment portfolio's credit concentration risk to issuers could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. for discussion of the company's exposure to credit concentration risk of reinsurers, see the risk factor below. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently use reinsurance to reduce the effect of losses that may arise from, among other things, catastrophes, gmdb's under variable annuity contracts and other risks that can cause unfavorable results of operations, and to effect the sale of one line of business to an independent company. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers' credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or dispute their contractual obligations. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us, including the impact of any insolvency or rehabilitation proceedings involving a reinsurer that could affect the company's access to collateral held in trust, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. this risk may be magnified by a concentration of reinsurance-related credit risk resulting from the sale of the company's individual life business. further details of such concentration can be found in part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - enterprise risk management - reinsurance as a risk management strategy - life insurance product reinsurance recoverable. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. reinsurance pricing changes significantly over time, and no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop to the extent possible other alternatives to reinsurance, such as use of the capital markets. further, due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables will be due, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations. the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. 19 moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. these obligations include payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends on our capital stock. the connecticut insurance holding company laws limit the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers and require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of dividends above certain levels. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, or deemed commercially domiciled, generally contain similar, and in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. dividends paid to us by our insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on their cash requirements. for further discussion on dividends from insurance subsidiaries, see part ii, item 7, md&amp;a - capital resources &amp; liquidity. our rights to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries, for example, upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the ability of holders of our common stock to benefit indirectly from a distribution, are subject to the prior claims of creditors of the applicable subsidiary, except to the extent that we may be a creditor of that subsidiary. holders of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. insurance industry and product-related risks our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the coverage provided to policyholders that we insure. we establish property and casualty loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes, both natural and man-made, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable natural events, including, among others, earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, wind storms, fires, tornadoes, and pandemics. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, explosions or infrastructure failures. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, tornadoes in the midwest and southeast, earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states, and the spread of disease. any increases in the values and concentrations of insured employees and property in these areas would increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. in addition, changing climate conditions across longer time scales, including the potential risk of broader climate change, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the severity of certain natural catastrophe losses across various geographic regions.potential examples of the impact of climate change on catastrophe exposure include, but are not limited to the following: an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere, more frequent brush fires in certain geographies due to prolonged periods of drought, higher incidence of deluge flooding, and the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. in addition, our businesses have exposure to global or nationally occurring pandemics caused by highly infectious and potentially fatal diseases, and are spread through human, animal or plant populations. additionally, due to such catastrophes, caused by natural or man-made events, policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies. 20 our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. to the extent that the frequency or severity of catastrophe losses changes over time or models improve, we will seek to reflect any of these changes in the design and pricing of our products. however, the company may be exposed to regulatory or legislative actions that prevent a full recognition of loss expectations in the design or pricing of our products or result in additional risk-shifting to the insurance industry. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 ( tripra ) is also limited. although tripra provides benefits for certified acts of terrorism that exceed a certain threshold of industry losses ($100 in 2015, increasing to $200 by 2020), those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. under tripra, once our losses exceed a deductible of 20% of our subject commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us a percentage of our losses (85% in 2015, decreasing 1% annually until 2020) attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. our estimated deductible under the program is $1.2 billion for 2016. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our results during the period or periods affected and, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks or other geopolitical or military crises, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity at the time it becomes known. competitive activity or technological changes may adversely affect our market share, demand for our products, or our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. our principal competitors are other property and casualty insurers, group benefits providers and other mutual fund companies. competitors may expand their risk appetites in products and services where the hartford currently enjoys a competitive advantage. larger competitors with more capital and new entrants to the market could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. for example, larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. consolidation among insurance companies may allow competitors to grow earnings and achieve economies of scale, giving them an overall competitive advantage. in addition, a number of insurers are making use of "big data" analytics to, among other things, improve pricing accuracy, be more targeted in marketing, strengthen customer relationships and provide more customized loss prevention services. if they are able to use big data more effectively than we are, it may give them a competitive advantage. because of the highly competitive nature of these industries, there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 21 our business could also be affected by technological changes, including further advancements in automotive safety features, the development of autonomous or self-driving vehicles, and platforms that facilitate ride sharing. these technologies could impact the frequency or severity of losses, disrupt the demand for certain of our products, or reduce the size of the automobile insurance market as a whole. while there is substantial uncertainty about the timing, penetration and reliability of such technologies, any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may experience difficulty in marketing, distributing and providing insurance products and investment advisory services through current and future distribution channels and advisory firms. we distribute our insurance products and mutual funds through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through or in connection with individual third-party arrangements. for example, we market personal lines products in large part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 1, 2023. our ability to distribute products through affinity partners may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of certain of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties, including potentially as a result of a strategic transaction or other company initiatives, could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge or restrict an insurer's ability to offer or enforce specific policy deductibles. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates or accept additional risk not contemplated in our existing rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to lower returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state's insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards, more expansive coverage offerings and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards, more coverage restrictions and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in all of our property and casualty insurance product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. in addition, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 22 adjustments to our risk management program relating to products we offered with guaranteed benefits to emphasize protection of economic value may result in statutory and u.s. gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income (loss). some of the in-force business within our talcott resolution operations, especially variable annuities, offer guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits. these gmdbs and gmwbs expose the company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk. a decline in equity markets would not only result in lower earnings, but would also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we use reinsurance and benefit designs, such as caps, to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with product management actions, such as rider fee increases, investment restrictions and buyout offers, as well as derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, which could result in a need for additional capital to support in-force business. from time to time, we may adjust our risk management program based on contracts in force, market conditions, or other factors. while we believe that these actions improve the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, any such adjustments may result in greater statutory and u.s. gaap earnings volatility and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income (loss) in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, higher interest rates and declines in volatility. we are also subject to the risk that these management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory and legal risks the impact of regulatory initiatives and legislative developments, including the implementation of the dodd-frank act of 2010, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory initiatives and legislative developments may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. u.s. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities, including the sec, the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve"), the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ), the nyse and finra are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. such measures are likely to lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important companies in particular. such measures could include taxation of financial transactions and restrictions on employee compensation. the dodd-frank act was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. implementation of the dodd-frank act is ongoing and may affect our operations and governance in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the dodd-frank act requires central clearing of, and imposes new margin requirements on, certain derivatives transactions, which increases the costs of our hedging program. other provisions in the dodd-frank act that may impact us include: the federal insurance office within treasury; the possible adverse impact on the pricing and liquidity of the securities in which we invest resulting from the proprietary trading and market making limitation of the volcker rule; the possible adverse impact on the market for insurance-linked securities, including catastrophe bonds, resulting from the limitations of banking entity involvement in and ownership of certain asset-backed securities transactions; and enhancements to corporate governance, especially regarding risk management. the dodd-frank act vests the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) with the power to designate systemically important institutions, which are subject to special regulatory supervision and other provisions intended to prevent, or mitigate the impact of, future disruptions in the u.s. financial system. based on its most current financial data, the hartford is below the quantitative thresholds used by the fsoc to determine which nonbank companies merit consideration. however, the fsoc has indicated it will review on a quarterly basis whether nonbank financial institutions meet the metrics for further review. if we were to be designated as a systemically important institution, we would be subject to heightened regulation under the federal reserve, which could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. in addition, we could be subject to assessments to pay for the orderly liquidation of other systemically important financial institutions that have become insolvent. as a result of these requirements, we could incur substantial costs that would affect our ability to price our products competitively, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 23 we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments involving claim litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or significant changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable law could have a similar effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves, and how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our products appropriately. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could also be adversely affected if judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from current expectations. potential changes in regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and can affect our strategy, as well as the demand for and profitability of the products we offer. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. these regulatory regimes are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than insurers, their shareholders and other investors. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing and authorization for lines of business, statutory capital and reserve requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business. in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. for example, the naic and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. the naic continues to enhance the u.s. system of insurance solvency regulation, with a particular focus on group supervision, risk-based capital, accounting and financial reporting, enterprise risk management and reinsurance. any proposed or future legislation or naic initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. in addition, the federal reserve board and the international association of insurance supervisors ("iais") each have initiatives underway to develop insurance group capital standards. while the company would not currently be subject to either of these capital standard regimes, it is possible that in the future standards similar to what is being contemplated by the federal reserve board or the iais could apply to the company. the naic is in the process of developing a u.s. group capital calculation that will employ a methodology based on aggregated risk-based capital. further, because these laws and regulations are complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that our business may not fully comply with a particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal, accounting, or reserving issue or that such regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. the application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may not be consistent with the opinion of state insurance departments. we cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. see the risk factor, the impact of regulatory initiatives and legislative developments, including the implementation of the dodd-frank act of 2010, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 24 changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. changes in federal or state tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, and could result in our incurring materially higher corporate taxes. higher tax rates may cause the small businesses we insure to hire fewer workers and decrease investment in their businesses, including purchasing vehicles, property and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. conversely, if income tax rates decline it could adversely affect the company's ability to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. in addition, the company's tax return reflects certain items, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. there is an increasing risk that, in the context of deficit reduction or overall tax reform, federal and/or state tax legislation could modify or eliminate these items, impacting the company, its investments, investment strategies, and/or its policyholders. although the specific form of any such legislation is uncertain, changes to the taxation of municipal bond interest could materially and adversely impact the value of those bonds, limit our investment choices and depress portfolio yield. elimination of the dividends received deduction or changes to the taxation of reserving methodologies for p&amp;c companies could increase the company's actual tax rate, thereby reducing earnings. moreover, many of the products that the company previously sold benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company previously sold annuity contracts that allowed policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. because the company no longer sells these products, changes in the future taxation of life insurance and/or annuity contracts will not adversely impact future sales. if, however, the treatment of earnings accrued inside an annuity contract was changed prospectively, and the tax-favored status of existing contracts was grandfathered, holders of existing contracts would be less likely to surrender, which would make running off our existing annuity business more difficult. regulatory requirements could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. before a person can acquire control of a u.s. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any such additional information as the insurance commissioner may deem necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders or in the public interest. generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer or its parent company. because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various u.s. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. other laws or required approvals pertaining to one or more of our existing subsidiaries, or a future subsidiary, may contain similar or additional restrictions on the acquisition of control of the company. these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control, including transactions that our board of directors and some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition. u.s. gaap and related financial reporting requirements are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by the relevant authoritative bodies. such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. changes in u.s. gaap and financial reporting requirements, or in the interpretation of u.s. gaap or those requirements, could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. other strategic and operational risks as our talcott resolution business continues to runoff, the company is exposed to a number of risks related to the runoff business that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. despite being in runoff, talcott resolution represents a meaningful share of the company's earnings. talcott resolution's revenues and earnings will decline over time as variable and fixed annuity policies lapse. while the company has been reducing expenses associated with the talcott resolution business as the revenues from that business decline, going forward it may become more difficult to reduce expenses, particularly corporate and other enterprise shared services costs, and this could adversely affect the company's results of operations going forward. in addition, dividends and distributions from the company's life insurance subsidiaries have helped fund a significant portion of share repurchases and pay downs of debt under the company's announced capital management program. as the talcott resolution earnings decline, there will be less retained earnings in the company's talcott resolution insurance subsidiaries available to fund capital management actions. 25 further, while the company continues to actively consider alternatives for reducing the size and risk of the annuity book of business, opportunities to do so may be limited and any initiatives pursued may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may negatively impact our statutory capital, net income, core earnings or shareholders' equity. the company could pursue transactions or other strategic options to reduce the size and risk of talcott resolution's annuity book of business which could result in a significant loss to the company. the ability to execute on our capital management plan, expense reduction initiatives and other actions, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, is subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the ability to execute on our capital management plan remains subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks. we may not achieve all of the benefits we expect to derive from our plan to repurchase our equity and reduce our debt. our capital management plan is subject to execution risks, including, among others, risks related to market fluctuations and investor interest and potential legal constraints that could delay execution at an otherwise optimal time. there can be no assurance that we will in fact complete our capital management plan over the planned time frame or at all. initiatives to reduce expenses so that our ongoing businesses remain or become cost efficient may not be successful and we may not be able to reduce corporate and shared services expenses in the manner and on the schedule we currently anticipate. we may take further actions beyond the capital management plan, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, that may involve additional uncertainties and risks that negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we use technology to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems or maintenance. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain third parties, to access our systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support, managing our investment portfolios and hedging programs. and conducting our financial reporting and analysis. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a cyber attack, a blackout, a terrorist attack (including conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological) or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees and business partners are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed. our systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer related penetrations. the frequency and sophistication of such threats continue to increase as well. while, to date, the hartford is not aware of having experienced a material breach of our cyber security systems, administrative and technical controls as well as other preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties, with whom we interact, impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. in addition, we routinely transmit, to third parties personal, confidential and proprietary information, which may be related to employees and customers, by email and other electronic means, along with receiving and storing such information on our systems. although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to utilize such capabilities in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with regulations enacted by u.s. federal and state governments, the european union or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others and, in some cases, specifying required control processes. a misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from an employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. 26 third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, including but not limited to third party administrators, are also subject to cyber-breaches of confidential information, along with the other risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third party liability and first party insurance coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all loss. our framework for managing operational risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us that could adversely affect our businesses. our business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage operational risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and other activities, many of which are very complex and for some of which we rely on third parties. in addition, information technology investments we have made or plan to make in order to improve our operations are subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks which may adversely impact our ability to achieve the intended business growth, expense reduction and operational efficiencies. in particular, a number of the information technology platforms we use to administer and service our business are aging. while we have replaced a number of these systems in recent years, some older information technology platforms remain in place and efforts to replace and modernize them may take longer than expected or may not achieve the intended benefits. we seek to monitor and control our exposure to operational risks through a risk control framework encompassing a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. we cannot be completely confident that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks, or that our employees and third-party agents will effectively implement them. management of operational risks can fail for a number of reasons, including design failure, systems failure, failures to perform, cyber security attacks, human error, or unlawful activities on the part of employees or third parties. in the event that our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations. if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing and similar third-party relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third-party vendors to provide certain services on our behalf. we have also taken action to reduce coordination costs and take advantage of economies of scale by transitioning multiple functions and services to a small number of third-party providers. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. if our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers, particularly those on which we rely for multiple functions or services, is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations), increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. for other risks associated with our outsourcing of certain functions, see the risk factor, if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 27 we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, systems, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may be subject to patent claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, systems, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is set forth in the enterprise risk

invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission. the risks described below are not the only ones facing the hartford. additional risks may also have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of the hartford. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. although potential federal asbestos-related legislation is being considered in the senate, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be enacted or what its effect would be on our aggregate asbestos liabilities. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 18 table of contents the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002, as extended through 2007, is also limited. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or periods affected and, if significant enough, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers being unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes, or other events that can cause unfavorable underwriting results, through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims and we are subject to our reinsurers credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could negatively affect our consolidated operating results. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. recently, the price of reinsurance has increased significantly, and may continue to increase. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. we are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. a rise in interest rates will reduce the net unrealized gain position of our investment portfolio, increase interest expense on our variable rate debt obligations and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain of our life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our life businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. in addition, certain of our life products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans. our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations, non u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product, and certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan variable annuity. these risks relate to the potential decreases in value and income resulting from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates verses the u.s. dollar. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product. in comparison, a strengthening of the japanese yen in comparison to the u.s. dollar and other currencies may increase our exposure to the guarantee benefits associated with the japan variable annuity. if significant, declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 19 table of contents we may be unable to effectively mitigate the impact of equity market volatility on our financial position and results of operations arising from obligations under annuity product guarantees, which may affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our life businesses where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. in addition, some of the products offered by these businesses, especially variable annuities, offer certain guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure as the equity markets decline. we are subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, especially the guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) offered with variable annuity products. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to minimize the claim exposure and the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. while we believe that these and other actions we have taken mitigate the risks related to these benefits, we are subject to the risks that reinsurers are unable or unwilling to pay, that other risk management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. regulatory proceedings or private claims relating to incentive compensation or payments made to brokers or other producers, alleged anti-competitive conduct and other sales practices could have a material adverse effect on us. we have received multiple regulatory inquiries regarding our compensation arrangements with brokers and other producers. for example, in june 2004, the company received a subpoena from the new york attorney general office in connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between brokers and carriers. in mid-september 2004 and subsequently, the company has received additional subpoenas from the new york attorney general office, which relate more specifically to possible anti-competitive activity among brokers and insurers. on october 14, 2004, the new york attorney general office filed a civil complaint against marsh mclennan companies, inc., and marsh, inc. (collectively, marsh ). the complaint alleges, among other things, that certain insurance companies, including the company, participated with marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that marsh would direct business to them. the company was not joined as a defendant in the action, which has since settled. since the beginning of october 2004, the company has received subpoenas or other information requests from attorneys general and regulatory agencies in more than a dozen jurisdictions regarding broker compensation, possible anti-competitive activity and sales practices. these inquiries have concerned lines of business in both our property casualty and life operations. the company may continue to receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from attorneys general or other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues. the company intends to continue cooperating fully with these investigations, and is conducting an internal review, with the assistance of outside counsel, regarding broker compensation issues in its property casualty and group benefits operations. although no regulatory action has been initiated against the company in connection with the allegations described in the civil complaint, it is possible that one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action against the company or one or more of its employees in the future on this matter or on other similar matters. if such an action is brought, it could have a material adverse effect on the company. regulatory and market-driven changes may affect our practices relating to the payment of incentive compensation to brokers and other producers, including changes that have been announced and those which may occur in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. we pay brokers and independent agents commissions and other forms of incentive compensation in connection with the sale of many of the company insurance products. since the new york attorney general office filed a civil complaint against marsh on october 14, 2004, several of the largest national insurance brokers, including marsh, aon corporation and willis group holdings limited, have announced that they have discontinued the use of contingent compensation arrangements. other industry participants may make similar, or different, determinations in the future. in addition, legal, legislative, regulatory, business or other developments may require changes to industry practices relating to incentive compensation. at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of these announced or potential changes on our business or distribution strategies, but such changes could have a material adverse effect on us in the future . our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular period or periods may be adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since 20 table of contents estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that actual losses and related loss expenses exceed our expectations and reserves recorded in our financial statements, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of these determinations, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. as a property and casualty insurer, we are particularly vulnerable to losses from the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made, the occurrence of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, floods, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. we also face substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states. catastrophes could disrupt our operations centers in these areas. further, we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. in addition, because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and profitability, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. in recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services firms that market products and services similar to ours. many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. these competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments that would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. we are involved in legal actions which do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. these actions include, among others, putative state and federal class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, and inland marine; improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other investment products; improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds; and unfair settlement practices in connection with the settlement of asbestos claims. we are also involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims. given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. like many other insurers, we also have been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos. traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux. the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos claims. because of the significant uncertainties surrounding these exposures, it is possible that our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. further, it is unknown whether potential federal asbestos-related legislation will be enacted, and if so, what its effect will be on the hartford aggregate asbestos liabilities. depending on the provisions of any legislation which is ultimately enacted, the legislation may have a material adverse effect on the company. 21 table of contents potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. we are subject to extensive laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the securities and exchange commission, the new york stock exchange, the national association of securities dealers, the u.s. department of justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. in addition, there is risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. state laws in the u.s. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners, or naic, regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions. our asset management operations are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. these regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. changes in all of these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. compliance with these laws and regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by general domestic and international economic and business conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of business we conduct. for example, in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. further, given that we offer our products and services in north america, japan, europe and south america, we are exposed to these risks in multiple geographic locations. our operations are subject to different local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and 22 table of contents challenges which may affect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolio, the required levels of our capital and surplus, and the credit quality of local counterparties. these risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in countries in which we operate, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks of our local borrowers and counterparties, lack of local business experience in certain markets, and, in certain cases, risks associated with the potential incompatibility with partners. additionally, much of our overall growth is due to our expansion into new markets for our investment products, primarily in japan. our expansion in these new markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these areas. accordingly, our overall success depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed despite these differing and dynamic economic, social and political conditions. we may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business and we cannot guarantee that the inability to successfully address the risks related to economic conditions in all of the geographic locations where we conduct business will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. we distribute our annuity, life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through individual third party arrangements. for example, we generated approximately 64% of our personal lines earned premium in 2005 under an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 1, 2010. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products. our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity at the time it becomes known. we may experience a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings which may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital, and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating organizations may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating organizations have, in their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating organization judgment of its rating and the subsequent rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take, or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating organizations, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or an announced potential downgrade, of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. the interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. a downgrade of our credit ratings, or an announced potential downgrade, could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. in addition, a downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us may adversely affect our liquidity. the hartford financial services group, inc. is a holding company with no significant operations. our principal asset is the stock of our insurance subsidiaries. state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. in addition, competitive pressures generally require certain of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments. limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt. 23 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is set forth in the capital markets risk management section of item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors investing in the hartford involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. although potential federal asbestos-related legislation has been considered in the senate, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be considered or be enacted in the future and, if so, what its effect would be on our aggregate asbestos liabilities. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002, as extended through 2007, is also limited. moreover, it is uncertain whether a federal terrorism risk insurance program similar to the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 will be enacted to cover events occurring after december 31, 2007. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or periods affected and, if significant enough, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased 20 table of contents reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers being unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes, or other events that can cause unfavorable results of operations, through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims and we are subject to our reinsurers credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could negatively affect our consolidated operating results. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. recently, the price of reinsurance has increased significantly, and may continue to increase. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. we are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. a rise in interest rates will reduce the net unrealized gain position of our investment portfolio, increase interest expense on our variable rate debt obligations and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain of our life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our life businesses, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our life businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. in addition, certain of our life products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans. our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations, non u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product, and certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan variable annuity. these risks relate to the potential decreases in value and income resulting from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product. in comparison, a strengthening of the japanese yen in comparison to the u.s. dollar and other currencies may increase our exposure to the guarantee benefits associated with the japan variable annuity. if significant, declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we may be unable to effectively mitigate the impact of equity market volatility on our financial position and results of operations arising from obligations under annuity product guarantees, which may affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our life businesses where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. in addition, some of the products offered by these businesses, especially variable annuities, offer certain guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure as the equity markets decline. we are subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, especially the guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) offered with variable annuity products. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to minimize the claim exposure and the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. while we believe that these and other actions we have taken mitigate the risks related to these benefits, we are subject to the risks that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, that other risk management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces 21 table of contents economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. regulatory proceedings or private claims relating to incentive compensation or payments made to brokers or other producers, alleged anti-competitive conduct and other sales practices could have a material adverse effect on us. we have received multiple regulatory inquiries regarding our compensation arrangements with brokers and other producers. for example, in june 2004, the company received a subpoena from the new york attorney general office in connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between brokers and carriers. in mid-september 2004 and subsequently, the company has received additional subpoenas from the new york attorney general office, which relate more specifically to possible anti-competitive activity among brokers and insurers. on october 14, 2004, the new york attorney general office filed a civil complaint against marsh mclennan companies, inc., and marsh, inc. (collectively, marsh ). the complaint alleges, among other things, that certain insurance companies, including the company, participated with marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that marsh would direct business to them. the company was not joined as a defendant in the action, which has since settled. since the beginning of october 2004, the company has received subpoenas or other information requests from attorneys general and regulatory agencies in more than a dozen jurisdictions regarding broker compensation, possible anti-competitive activity and sales practices. these inquiries have concerned lines of business in both our property casualty and life operations. the company may continue to receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from attorneys general or other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues. the company intends to continue cooperating fully with these investigations, and is conducting an internal review, with the assistance of outside counsel, regarding broker compensation issues in its property casualty and group benefits operations. although no regulatory action has been initiated against the company in connection with the allegations described in the civil complaint, it is possible that one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action against the company or one or more of its employees in the future on this matter or on other similar matters. if such an action is brought, it could have a material adverse effect on the company. regulatory and market-driven changes may affect our practices relating to the payment of incentive compensation to brokers and other producers, including changes that have been announced and those which may occur in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. we pay brokers and independent agents commissions and other forms of incentive compensation in connection with the sale of many of our insurance products. since the new york attorney general office filed a civil complaint against marsh on october 14, 2004, several of the largest national insurance brokers, including marsh, aon corporation and willis group holdings limited, have announced that they have discontinued the use of contingent compensation arrangements. other industry participants may make similar, or different, determinations in the future. in addition, legal, legislative, regulatory, business or other developments may require changes to industry practices relating to incentive compensation. pursuant to settlement agreements reached with regulators, several insurance companies have agreed to restrictions on the payment of contingent compensation relating to the placement of excess casualty insurance policies. these insurers have agreed that the restrictions may be extended in time, and to other property and casualty lines, if insurers in a given line or segment, that together represent more than 65% of the market share in the insurance line (based upon national gross written premiums), do not pay contingent compensation. on november 30, 2006, the new york attorney general office notified these insurers that the 65% threshold had been reached for a number of insurance lines, including personal automobile and homeowners insurance. as a result, beginning january 1, 2007, these insurers were prohibited from paying contingent compensation relating to the placement of these types of insurance. in addition, on december 21, 2006, chubb corporation agreed to forego the payment of contingent compensation for all p c insurance lines pursuant to a settlement agreement reached with regulators. these insurers, including chubb, have also agreed to support legislation and regulations to abolish contingent compensation and to require greater disclosure of compensation. at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of these announced or potential future changes on our business or distribution strategies, but such changes could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular period or periods may be adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs 22 table of contents for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that actual losses and related loss expenses exceed our expectations and reserves recorded in our financial statements, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of these determinations, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made, the occurrence of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. we also face substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism, disease pandemics and political instability. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states. further we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. in addition, in the aftermath of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events were updated to incorporate medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity. our life insurance operations are also exposed to risk of loss from catastrophes. for example, natural or man-made disasters or a disease pandemic such as could arise from avian flu, could significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience. policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment products. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and profitability, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. in recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services firms that market products and services similar to ours. many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. these competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments that would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves. pervasive or dramatic changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. similarly, changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable laws could have the same effect. to the extent that judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from our current expectations, they could have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 23 table of contents potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. we are subject to extensive laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the securities and exchange commission, the new york stock exchange, the national association of securities dealers, the u.s. department of justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. in addition, there is risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. state laws in the u.s. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners, or naic, regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions. our asset management operations are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. these regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. changes in all of these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. compliance with these laws and regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 24 table of contents our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by general domestic and international economic and business conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of business we conduct. for example, in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. further, given that we offer our products and services in north america, japan, europe and south america, we are exposed to these risks in multiple geographic locations. our operations are subject to different local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges which may affect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolio, the required levels of our capital and surplus, and the credit quality of local counterparties. these risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in countries in which we operate, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks of our local borrowers and counterparties, lack of local business experience in certain markets, and, in certain cases, risks associated with the potential incompatibility with partners. additionally, some of our recent growth is due to our expansion into new markets for our investment products, primarily in japan. during 2006, our sales of investment products in japan declined significantly from the prior year, as competition increased from both domestic and foreign competitors. looking forward, our overall success in these new markets will depend on our ability to succeed despite differing and dynamic economic, social and political conditions. we may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business and we cannot guarantee that the inability to successfully address the risks related to economic conditions in all of the geographic locations where we conduct business will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. we distribute our annuity, life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through individual third party arrangements. for example, we generated approximately 66% of our personal lines earned premium in 2006 under an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues until january 1, 2020. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products. our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity at the time it becomes known. we may experience a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings which may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital, and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating organizations may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating organizations have, in their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating organization judgment of its rating and the subsequent rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take, or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating organizations, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or an announced potential downgrade, of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. the interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. a downgrade of our credit ratings, or an announced potential downgrade, could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. in addition, a downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above. as a result, it is possible that any, or a 25 table of contents combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us may adversely affect our liquidity. the hartford financial services group, inc. is a holding company with no significant operations. our principal asset is the stock of our insurance subsidiaries. state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. in addition, competitive pressures generally require certain of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments. limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a particular quarterly or annual period or periods. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer, and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurer ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to an unacceptable returns on equity. laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a particular quarterly or annual period or periods. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in a number of product lines and states, we are currently experiencing premium rate reductions. in these product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. even in a period of rate increases, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a particular quarterly or annual period or periods. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or other unanticipated events, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain affiliated third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, such as providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, and providing customer support. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. our systems could also be subject to physical and electronic break-ins, and subject to similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. this may impede or interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. 26 table of contents if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised. we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties and expect to do so selectively in the future. if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy, third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a particular quarterly or annual period or periods. potential changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results or financial condition. many of the products that the company sells currently benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company sells life insurance policies which benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries. we also sell annuity contracts which allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. other products that the company sells also enjoy similar, as well as other, types of tax advantages. the company also benefits from certain tax benefits, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. there is risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company or its policyholders. this could occur in the context of deficit reduction or several types of fundamental tax reform. the effects of any such changes could result in materially lower product sales, lapses of policies currently held, and/or materially higher corporate taxes that would be incurred by the company. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is set forth in the capital markets risk management section of item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors investing in the hartford involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. although potential federal asbestos-related legislation has been considered in the senate, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be reconsidered or enacted in the future and, if so, what its effect would be on our aggregate asbestos liabilities. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 is also limited. accordingly, the effects of a 21 table of contents terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or periods affected and, if significant enough, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes or mortality, or other events that can cause unfavorable results of operations, through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could negatively affect our consolidated operating results. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. historically, reinsurance pricing has changed significantly from time to time. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, and foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. a rise in interest rates will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain of our life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our life businesses, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. a widening of credit spreads will increase the net unrealized loss position of the investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit based non-qualifying derivatives where the company assumes credit exposure, and, if issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an extended period of time, would likely result in higher other-than-temporary impairments. credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities. in addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our life businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. in addition, certain of our life products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans. our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations, non u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, our yen-denominated individual fixed annuity product, and certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan variable annuity. these risks relate to potential decreases in value and income resulting from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product. in comparison, a strengthening of the japanese yen in comparison to the u.s. dollar and other currencies may increase our exposure to the guarantee benefits associated with the japan variable annuity. if significant, declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 22 table of contents we may be unable to effectively mitigate the impact of equity market volatility on our financial position and results of operations arising from obligations under annuity product guarantees, which may affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. some of the products offered by our life businesses, especially variable annuities, offer certain guaranteed benefits which, as a result of any decline in equity markets would not only result in potentially lower earnings, but may also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we are subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, especially the guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ( gmab ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) offered with variable annuity products. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to minimize the claim exposure and the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. while we believe that these and other actions we have taken mitigate the risks related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, and are subject to the risk that other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made, the occurrence of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or liquidity. our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. we also face substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism, disease pandemics and political instability. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. in the aftermath of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events were updated to incorporate medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. our life insurance operations are also exposed to risk of loss from catastrophes. for example, natural or man-made disasters or a disease pandemic such as could arise from avian flu, could significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience. policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment products. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or liquidity. 23 table of contents competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and profitability, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. in recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services firms that market products and services similar to ours. many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. these competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or dramatic changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. similarly, changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable laws could have the same effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves. similarly, changes in the judicial and legislative environment can adversely affect our ability to price our products. to the extent that judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from our current expectations, they could have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. we are subject to extensive laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non-governmental self-regulatory agencies, including foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the securities and exchange commission, the new york stock exchange, the national association of securities dealers, the u.s. department of justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. in addition, there is risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment, even absent any change of interpretation by any particular regulator or enforcement authority, may cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. 24 table of contents state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; requiring insurers to dividend to policy holders any excess profits; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners, or naic, regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. changes in these laws and regulations, or in the interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. compliance with these laws and regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by general domestic and international economic and business conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of business we conduct. for example, in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. further, given that we offer our products and services in north america, japan, europe and south america, we are exposed to these risks in multiple geographic locations. our operations are subject to different local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges, which may affect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolio, the required levels of our capital and surplus and the credit quality of local counterparties. these risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in countries in which we operate, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks of our local borrowers and counterparties, lack of local business experience in certain markets and, in certain cases, risks associated with potential incompatibility with partners. additionally, some of our recent growth is due to our expansion into new markets for our investment products, primarily in japan. during the fourth quarter of 2007, our sales of investment products in japan declined significantly from the earlier part of 2007 as competition from both domestic and foreign competitors increased and as a result of the implementation of the financial instruments exchange law ( fiel ) issued by the financial services agency in september 2007. fiel is designed to strengthen the protection of japanese consumers who buy financial products, such as variable annuities, and is lengthening the sales cycle as the marketplace adapts to the new sales practices. looking forward, our overall success in these new markets will depend on our ability to succeed despite differing and dynamic economic, social and political conditions. there is a risk that we may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, and we cannot guarantee that the inability to successfully address the risks related to economic conditions in all of the geographic locations where we conduct business will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 25 table of contents we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. we distribute our annuity, life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through individual third-party arrangements. for example, we generated approximately 69% of our personal lines earned premium in 2007 under an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues until january 1, 2020. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products. our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity at the time it becomes known. we may experience a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade, or an announced potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. the interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. a downgrade of our credit ratings, or an announced potential downgrade, could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. in addition, a downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us may adversely affect our liquidity. the hartford financial services group, inc. is a holding company with no significant operations. our principal asset is the stock of our insurance subsidiaries. state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. in addition, competitive pressures generally require certain of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments. limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, 26 table of contents joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to an unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in a number of product lines and states, we continue to experience premium rate reductions. in these product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. even in a period of rate increases, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or other unanticipated events, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain affiliated third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. our systems could also be subject to physical and electronic break-ins, and subject to similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. this may impede or interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows. if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised. we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties and expect to do so selectively in the future. if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy, third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. potential changes in federal or state tax laws, including changes impacting the availability of the separate account dividend received deduction, could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results or financial condition. many of the products that the company sells benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company sells life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries. we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. other products that the company sells also enjoy similar, as well as other, types of tax advantages. the company also benefits from certain tax benefits, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. there is risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company or its policyholders. this could occur in the context of deficit reduction or other tax reforms. the effects of any such changes could result in materially lower product sales, lapses of policies currently held, and/or our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes. losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could adversely affect the value of our investments, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may 27 table of contents default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and

stated) general the hartford financial services group, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the hartford or the company ) is an insurance and financial services company. the hartford, headquartered in connecticut, is among the largest providers of investment products, individual life, group life and group disability insurance products, and property and casualty insurance products in the united states of america. hartford fire insurance company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of the hartford subsidiaries. the hartford writes its business primarily in the united states of america. during the second quarter of 2009, the company acquired federal trust corporation and became a savings and loan holding company. at december 31, 2009, total assets and total stockholders equity of the hartford were $307.7 billion and $17.9 billion, respectively. organization the hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry. the company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to consumers and businesses. the company is continuously seeking to develop and expand its distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies of scale and improved technology, and capitalizes on its brand name and the hartford stag logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry. as a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, the hartford financial services group, inc. has no significant business operations of its own. therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations. additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the hartford financial services group, inc. may be found in the capital resources and liquidity section of part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md a ). the company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the company, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to series of the hartford mutual funds, inc.; the hartford mutual funds ii, inc.; and the hartford income shares fund, inc. (collectively, mutual funds ), consisting of 52 mutual funds and 1 closed-end fund, as of december 31, 2009. the company charges fees to these funds, which are recorded as revenue by the company. these mutual funds are registered with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) under the investment company act of 1940. the company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, also provides investment management and administrative services (for which it receives revenue) for 18 mutual funds established under the laws of the province of ontario, canada, and registered with the ontario securities commission. the mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the company. as such, the mutual fund assets and liabilities and related investment returns are not reflected in the company consolidated financial statements since they are not assets, liabilities and operations of the company. reporting segments the hartford is organized into two major operations: life and property casualty, each containing reporting segments. within the life and property casualty operations, the hartford conducts business principally in eleven reporting segments. corporate primarily includes the company debt financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities, banking operations and certain purchase accounting adjustments. the following is a discussion of life and property casualty operations, including principal products, distribution, and competition. for financial disclosures on revenues by product, profit and loss, and assets for each reporting segment, see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. life segments life is organized into six reporting segments, retail products group ( retail ), individual life, group benefits, retirement plans, international and institutional solutions group ( institutional ). life other category includes: leveraged private placement life insurance; corporate items not directly attributable to any of its reporting segments; the mark-to-mark adjustment for international variable annuity account assets that are classified as equity securities, trading, and related change in interest credited; and intersegment eliminations. for disclosures of assets under management, account values, fully insured ongoing premiums, life insurance in-force and net investment spread, see part ii, item 7, md a, key performance measures and ratios and the respective segment discussions. life provides investment products for approximately 7 million customers; life insurance for approximately 753,000 customers, group benefits products for millions of individuals, and maintains in-force annuity products for approximately 485,000 international customers. 5 table of contents life principal products retail provides variable and fixed individual annuities with living and death benefit guarantees, mutual funds and 529 plans in the united states. in october 2009, the company launched a new variable annuity product designed to meet customer needs for growth and income within the risk tolerances of the hartford which is replacing its guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit product. individual life provides variable universal life, universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance products to affluent, emerging affluent and business life insurance clients. group benefits provides group life, accident and disability coverage, group retiree health and voluntary benefits to individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions. group benefits offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing services and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. policies sold in this segment are generally term insurance allowing group benefits to adjust the rates or terms of its policies in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, declining interest rates, and other factors. policies are typically sold with one-, two- or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product. retirement plans provides retirement products and services, including asset management and plan administration, to small and medium-size corporations pursuant to section 401(k) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended ( 401(k) ). retirement also provides retirement products and services, including asset management and plan administration, to municipalities and not-for-profit organizations pursuant to section 457 and 403(b) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended ( 457 and 403(b) ). in 2008, retirement completed three acquisitions. return on assets was lower for retirement plans overall in 2009 reflecting in part, a full year of the new business mix represented by the acquisitions, which includes larger, more institutionally priced plans, predominantly executed on a mutual fund platform, and the cost of maintaining multiple technology platforms during the integration period. international, with operations in japan, brazil, ireland, canada, and the united kingdom, provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to individuals and groups outside the united states. during the second quarter of 2009, the company suspended all new sales in the japan and european operations. international is currently completing its restructuring of its operations to maximize profitability and capital efficiency while continuing to focus on risk management and maintaining appropriate service levels for in-force policies. in the fourth quarter of 2009, international has entered into an agreement to divest its brazil joint venture. institutional, prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, provided variable private placement life insurance ( ppli ), structured settlements, institutional annuities, longevity assurance, income annuities, institutional mutual funds and stable value investment products. in the fourth quarter of 2009, the company completed a strategic review of the institutional business and has decided to exit several businesses that have been determined to be outside of the company core business model. institutional ppli, mutual funds, income annuities and certain institutional annuities will continue to be managed for growth. the private placement life insurance industry (including the corporate-owned and bank-owned life insurance markets) has experienced a slowdown in sales due to, among other things, limited availability of stable value wrap providers. we believe that the company current ppli assets will experience high persistency, but our ability to grow this business in the future will be affected by near term market and industry challenges. structured settlements, guaranteed investment products, and most institutional annuities will not be actively marketed, however, certain guaranteed investment products, such as funding agreements, may be offered on a selective basis. life distribution retail distribution network includes national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and independent financial advisors. life periodically negotiates provisions and terms of its relationships with unaffiliated parties, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to life or such third parties. life primary wholesaler of its individual annuities is hartford life distributors, llc, and its affiliate, planco, llc (collectively hld ) which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of hartford life. hld provides sales support to registered representatives, financial planners and broker-dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the united states. as part of the company assessment of its opportunities in the variable annuity marketplace it significantly scaled back its hld operations in 2009. individual life distribution network includes national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks, independent agents, independent life and property-casualty agents, and woodbury financial services, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary retail broker-dealer. to wholesale life products, life has a group of highly qualified life insurance professionals with specialized training in sophisticated life insurance sales. group benefits distribution network includes an experienced group of company employees, managed through a regional sales office system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets, including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. retirement plans distribution network includes company employees with extensive experience selling its products and services through national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and other financial institutions. international distribution network, prior to the second quarter of 2009, included broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and independent financial advisors. international suspended sales in the second quarter of 2009 in japan and the u.k. 6 table of contents institutional distribution network includes: specialized brokers, with expertise in the large case market; financial advisors that work with individual investors; investment banking and wealth management specialists; benefits consulting firms; investment consulting firms employed by retirement plan sponsors; and hartford employees. life competition retail and retirement compete with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain banks, securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial intermediaries marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. product sales are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and credited rates, reputation and customer service. retail annuity deposits continue to decline resulting from the recent equity market volatility and competition. many competitors have responded to the recent equity market volatility by increasing the price of their living benefit products and changing the level of the guarantee offered. management believes that the most significant industry de-risking changes have occurred. however, competitors continue to sell annuity products with significant guarantees. in the first six months of 2009, the company increased fees on in-force variable annuity guarantees in order to address the risks and costs associated with variable annuity benefit features. the company continues to explore other risk limiting techniques including product design, hedging and reinsurance. as part of the company de-risking initiative, the company is transitioning to a new variable annuity product designed to meet customers future income needs within the risk tolerances of the company. retail mutual funds compete with other mutual fund companies and differentiate themselves through product solutions, performance, expenses, wholesaling and service. in this non-proprietary broker sold market, the hartford and its competitors compete aggressively for net sales. success will be driven by diversifying net sales across the mutual fund platform, delivering superior investment performance and creating new investment solutions for current and future mutual fund shareholders. for the 457 and 403(b) as well as the 401(k) markets, which offer mutual funds wrapped in a variable annuity, variable funding agreement, or mutual fund retirement program, the variety of available funds and their performance is most important to plan sponsors. the competitors tend to be the major mutual fund companies. the past few years have seen consolidation among industry providers seeking to increase scale, improve cost efficiencies, and enter new market segments. the consolidation of providers is expected to continue as smaller providers exit the market. individual life competes with approximately 1,000 life insurance companies in the united states, as well as other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products . product sales are affected primarily by the breadth and quality of life insurance products, pricing, relationships with third-party distributors, effectiveness of wholesaling support, pricing and availability of reinsurance, and the quality of underwriting and customer service. the individual life industry continues to see a distribution shift away from the traditional life insurance sales agents, to the consultative financial advisor as the place people go to buy their life insurance. individual life regional sales office system is a differentiator in the market and allows it to compete effectively across multiple distribution outlets. group benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. group benefits focuses on its risk management expertise and on efficiencies and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. competitive factors primarily affecting group benefits are the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for coverage and services, life relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of customer service. in addition, active price competition continues in the marketplace resulting in longer rate guarantee periods being offered to customers. top tier carriers in the marketplace also offer on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the group benefits business provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. institutional competes with other life insurance companies and asset managers who provide investment and risk management solutions. product sales are often affected by competitive factors such as investment performance, company credit ratings, perceived financial strength, product design, marketplace visibility, distribution capabilities, fees, credited rates, and customer service. in 2009, ratings agency downgrades, as well as changes in the company strategic business model, limited institutional sales and resulted in the company exiting certain markets. for institutional mutual funds, the variety of available funds, fee levels, and fund performance are most important to plan sponsors and investment consultants. competitors tend to be the major mutual fund companies, insurance companies, and asset managers. 7 table of contents property casualty segments property casualty is organized into five reporting segments: the underwriting segments of personal lines, small commercial, middle market and specialty commercial (collectively ongoing operations ); and the other operations segment. for a discussion of property casualty operations including segment performance, see part ii, item 7, md a, key performance measures and ratios and the respective segment discussions. property casualty principal products property casualty provides (1) workers compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, specialty casualty, marine, livestock and fidelity and surety coverages to commercial accounts primarily throughout the united states; (2) professional liability coverage and directors and officers liability coverage; (3) automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverage to individuals throughout the united states; and (4) insurance-related services. the hartford seeks to distinguish itself in the property and casualty market through its product depth and innovation, distribution capacity, customer service expertise, and technology for ease of doing business. personal lines provides standard automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages to individuals across the united states, including a special program designed exclusively for members of aarp. over the past three years, the hartford rolled out new auto and homeowners products with more coverage options and customized pricing tailored to a customer individual risk. aarp represents a significant portion of the total personal lines business and amounted to earned premiums of $2.8 billion in both 2009 and 2008 and $2.7 billion in 2007. personal lines also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through the aarp health program. in july, 2009, the company extended the aarp health program agreement through 2018. small commercial and middle market provide workers compensation, property, automobile, liability and umbrella coverages under several different products, primarily throughout the united states. in small commercial, some of these coverages are sold together as part of a single multi-peril package policy called spectrum. the sale of spectrum business owners package policies and workers compensation policies accounts for most of the written premium in the small commercial segment. like personal lines, small commercial offers a product with more coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder individualized risk characteristics. workers compensation insurance accounts for the largest share of the written premium in the middle market segment. small commercial businesses generally represent companies with up to $5 in annual payroll, $15 in annual revenues or $15 in total property values while middle market businesses generally represent companies with greater than $5 in annual payroll, $15 in annual revenues or $15 in total property values. specialty commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk management services. specialty commercial provides standard commercial insurance products including workers compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies. specialty commercial also provides professional liability, fidelity, surety and specialty casualty coverages. a significant portion of specialty casualty business, including workers compensation business, is written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides collateral to support loss payments made within their deductible. the specialty casualty business also provides retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. captive and specialty programs within specialty commercial, provides insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups. in addition, specialty commercial provides third-party administrator services for claims administration, integrated benefits and loss control through specialty risk services, llc, a subsidiary of the company. the other operations segment operates under a single management structure, heritage holdings, which is responsible for two related activities. the first activity is the management of certain subsidiaries and operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new business. the second is the management of claims (and the associated reserves) related to asbestos, environmental and other exposures. property casualty marketing and distribution personal lines reaches diverse markets through multiple distribution channels including direct sales to the consumer, brokers and independent agents. in direct sales to the consumer, the company markets its products through a mix of media, including direct marketing, the internet and advertising in publications. most of personal lines direct sales to the consumer are through its exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp to market automobile, homeowners and home-based business insurance products to aarp nearly 37 million members. the hartford exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp continues until january 1, 2020 for automobile, homeowners and home-based business. this agreement provides personal lines with an important competitive advantage as management expects favorable baby boom demographics to increase aarp membership during this period. the personal lines agency business provides customized products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market. similar to the other ongoing operations segments, these independent agents are not employees of the hartford. an important strategic objective of the company is to develop common products and processes for all of its personal lines business regardless of the distribution channel. in 2009, the company began selling its new open road advantage auto product in 20 states. in those 20 states, the open road advantage auto product is sold across the company distribution channels, including directly to aarp members, through independent agents to both aarp members and non-members and directly to non-members in four pilot states. 8 table of contents both small commercial and middle market provide insurance products and services through the company home office located in hartford, connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. the segments market their products nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. the current pace of consolidation within the independent agent and broker distribution channel will likely continue such that, in the future, a larger share of written premium will likely be concentrated with the larger agents and brokers. in small commercial, the company also has relationships with payroll service providers whereby the company offers insurance products to customers of the payroll service providers. specialty commercial provides insurance products and services through its home office located in hartford, connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. the segment markets its products nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent retail agents, brokers and wholesalers. property casualty competition the personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete on the basis of price, product, service (including claims handling), stability of the insurer and brand recognition. companies with recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. in the past three years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and retain profitable business. this has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the consumer. sales of personal lines insurance directly to the consumer have been growing faster than sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance, and now sales of auto insurance direct to the consumer represent more than 20% of total industry auto premium. carriers that distribute products mainly through agents have been competing by offering agents increased commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. more agents have been using comparative rater tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. the use of comparative rater tools has further increased price competition. carriers with more efficient cost structures will have an advantage in competing for new business through price. the use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business and, carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. many insurers have reduced their writings of new homeowners business in catastrophe-exposed states which has intensified competition in areas that are not subject to the same level of catastrophes, such as states in the midwest. the total market premium for personal auto insurance is expected to grow about 3% in 2010 driven primarily by increases in written pricing with new passenger vehicle sales expected to be relatively flat. despite the sluggish housing market, total market premium for personal homeowners insurance is expected to increase about 3% to 4% in 2010 driven by rate increases and efforts to improve insurance-to-value. the insurance market for small commercial businesses is competitive with insurers seeking to differentiate themselves through product, price, service and technology. the hartford competes against a number of large, national carriers as well as regional competitors in certain territories. competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. the market for small commercial business has become more competitive as favorable loss costs in the past few years have led carriers to expand coverage and reduce pricing. written premium growth rates in the small commercial market have slowed and underwriting margins will likely decrease due to earned pricing decreases and increases in loss cost severity. a number of companies have sought to grow their business by increasing their underwriting appetite, appointing new agents and expanding business with existing agents. carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more aggressively competing for small commercial accounts as small commercial business has generally been less price-sensitive. similar to the personal lines market, carriers offering small commercial products have been improving their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with the agent including the use of predictive modeling tools and automation to speed up the process of evaluating a risk and quoting on new business. as a result, price competition has increased, particularly for larger accounts within small commercial. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller insurers. the middle market commercial insurance marketplace is a highly competitive environment regarding product, price and service. the hartford competes against a number of large, national carriers as well as regional insurers in certain territories. competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and alternative risk sharing groups. middle market business is characterized as high touch with case-by-case underwriting and pricing decisions. as such, compared to small commercial, the pricing of middle market accounts is prone to more significant variation or cyclicality from year to year. legislative reforms in a number of states in recent years have helped to control indemnity costs on workers compensation claims, but these have also led to rate reductions in many states. in addition, companies writing middle market business have continued to experience a reduction in average premium size due to shrinking company payrolls, exposure bases and continued price competition. these factors coupled with soft market conditions, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have resulted in more new business opportunities in the marketplace as customers shop their policies for a better price. despite additional opportunities, the hartford continues to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. in the soft market, middle market is seeing an increase in industry specialization by agents and brokers which has placed even greater importance on the carrier need to demonstrate industry expertise to win new business. to gain a competitive advantage, carriers are improving automation with the agent or broker, appointing more agents and enhancing their product offerings. 9 table of contents specialty commercial is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that operate independently within their specific industries. these businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have different business models and operating cycles. specialty commercial competes with other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations for much of its business on an account by account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller companies. disciplined underwriting and targeted returns are the objectives of specialty commercial since premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment view of perceived market opportunity. for specialty casualty business, written pricing competition continues to be significant, particularly for the larger individual accounts. carriers are trying to protect their in-force casualty business by starting to renew policies well before the policy renewal date. employing this early renewal practice often prevents other carriers from quoting on the business, resulting in fewer new business opportunities within the marketplace. with national account business, as the market continues to soften, more insureds may opt for guaranteed cost policies in lieu of loss-sensitive products. carriers writing professional liability business are increasingly more focused on profitable private, middle market companies. this trend has continued as the downturn in the economy has led to a significant drop in the number of initial public offerings and volatility for all public companies. losses taken on investment portfolios have affected the financial strength ratings of some insurers in the marketplace for directors and officers and errors and omissions insurance and a carrier new business opportunities can be significantly affected by customer perceptions about its financial strength. for surety business, favorable underwriting results within the past couple of years has led to more intense competition for market share. this could lead to written price declines and less favorable terms and conditions. driven by the upheaval in the credit markets, new private construction activity has declined dramatically, resulting in lower demand for contract surety business. life reserves life insurance subsidiaries of the company establish and carry as liabilities, predominantly, five types of reserves: (1) a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the policyholder as of the financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value, (2) a liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, (3) a liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; (4) fair value reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and (5) death and living benefit reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. the liabilities for unpaid losses and future policy benefits are calculated based on actuarially recognized methods using morbidity and mortality tables, which are modified to reflect life actual experience when appropriate. liabilities for unpaid losses include estimates of amounts to fully settle known reported claims as well as claims related to insured events that the company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. future policy benefit reserves are computed at amounts that, with additions from estimated net premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are expected to be sufficient to meet life policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured disability or death. other insurance liabilities include those for unearned premiums and benefits in excess of account value. reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves. property casualty reserves the hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the hartford. these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported to the hartford and those that have been incurred but not reported ( ibnr ) and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. this estimation process involves a variety of actuarial techniques and is primarily based on historical experience and consideration of current trends. the hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos-related and environmental-related exposures. as discussed further in part ii, item 7, md a critical accounting estimates, significant uncertainty limits the company ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses with regard to environmental and particularly asbestos claims. most of the company property and casualty reserves are not discounted. however, the company has discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted certain reserves for indemnity payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers compensation policies. for further discussion of the company discounted reserves, see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2009, net property and casualty reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ( u.s. gaap ) were approximately equal to net reserves reported on a statutory basis. under u.s. gaap, liabilities for unpaid losses for permanently disabled workers compensation claimants are discounted at rates that are no higher than risk-free interest rates and which generally exceed the statutory discount rates set by regulators, such that workers compensation reserves for statutory reporting are higher than the reserves for u.s. gaap reporting. largely offsetting the effect of the difference in discounting is that a portion of the u.s. gaap provision for uncollectible reinsurance is not recognized under statutory accounting. further discussion of the hartford property and casualty reserves, including asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in part ii, item 7, md a critical accounting estimates property and casualty reserves, net of reinsurance. 10 table of contents a reconciliation of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is herein referenced from note 11 of notes to

accident year, resulting in a reclassification of $347 of ibnr reserves from the 2003 to 2006 accident years to the 2002 and prior accident years. this reclassification of reserves by accident year had no effect on total recorded reserves within any segment or on total recorded reserves for any line of business within a segment. reserve changes for accident years 1999 prior the largest impacts of net reserve re-estimates are shown in the 1999 prior accident years. the reserve re-estimates in calendar year 2003 include an increase in reserves of $2.6 billion related to reserve strengthening based on the company evaluation of its asbestos reserves. the reserve evaluation that led to the strengthening in calendar year 2003 confirmed the company view of the existence of a substantial long-term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment. the reserve re-estimates in calendar years 2004 and 2006 were largely attributable to reductions in the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities. reserve changes for accident year 2000 prior to calendar year 2006, there was reserve deterioration, spread over several calendar years, on accident years 2000 and prior driven, in part, by deterioration of reserves for assumed casualty reinsurance and workers compensation claims. numerous actuarial assumptions on assumed casualty reinsurance turned out to be low, including loss cost trends, particularly on excess of loss business, and the impact of deteriorating terms and conditions. workers compensation reserves also deteriorated, as medical inflation trends were above initial expectations. reserve changes for accident years 2001 and 2002 accident years 2001 and 2002 are reasonably close to original estimates. however, each year shows some swings by calendar period, with some favorable development prior to calendar year 2005, largely offset by unfavorable development in calendar years 2005 through 2008. the release for accident year 2001 during calendar year 2004 relates primarily to reserves for september 11. subsequent adverse developments on accident year 2001 relate to assumed casualty reinsurance and unexpected development on mature claims in both general liability and workers compensation. reserve releases for accident year 2002 during calendar years 2003 and 2004 come largely from short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly and actual reported losses are predictive of ultimate losses. reserve increases on accident year 2002 during calendar year 2005 were recognized, as unfavorable development on accident years prior to 2002 caused the company to increase its estimate of unpaid losses for the 2002 accident year. 12 table of contents reserve changes for accident years 2003 through 2008 even after considering the 2007 calendar year reclassification of $347 of ibnr reserves from the 2003 to 2006 accident years to the 2002 and prior accident years, accident years 2003 through 2007 show favorable development in calendar years 2004 through 2009. a portion of the release comes from short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly. during calendar year 2005 and 2006, favorable re-estimates occurred in personal lines for both loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses. in addition, catastrophe reserves related to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes developed favorably in 2006. during calendar years 2005 through 2008, the company recognized favorable re-estimates of both loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses on workers compensation claims driven, in part, by state legal reforms, including in california and florida, underwriting actions and expense reduction initiatives that have had a greater impact in controlling costs than was originally estimated. in 2007, the company released reserves for small commercial package business claims as reported losses have emerged favorably to previous expectations. in 2007 through 2009, the company released reserves for middle market general liability claims due to the favorable emergence of losses for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims. reserves for professional liability claims were released in 2008 and 2009 related to the 2003 through 2007 accident years due to a lower estimate of claim severity on both directors and officers insurance claims and errors and omissions insurance claims. reserves of personal lines auto liability claims were released in 2008 due largely to an improvement in emerged claim severity for the 2005 to 2007 accident years. ceded reinsurance the hartford cedes insurance risk to reinsurance companies. reinsurance does not relieve the hartford of its primary liability and, as such, failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the hartford. the hartford evaluates the risk transfer of its reinsurance contracts, the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk. the company monitoring procedures include careful initial selection of its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where possible, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers. reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e., risk transfer). for further discussion, see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements. if the ceded transactions do not provide risk transfer, the company accounts for these transactions as financing transactions. for property casualty operations, these reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater diversification of business and limit the hartford maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. a major portion of the hartford property and casualty reinsurance is effected under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. the hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses over stipulated amounts. in accordance with normal industry practice, life is involved in both the cession and assumption of insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, the company policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by the life operations was $10. in addition, life has reinsured u.s. minimum death benefit guarantees, japan guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, as well as u.s. guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits offered in connection with its variable annuity contracts. reinsurance of the company gmwb riders meet the definition of a derivative reported at fair value: under fair value the change in fair value of the reinsurance derivative is reported in earnings. life also assumes reinsurance from other insurers. for the years ended december 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, life did not make any significant changes in the terms under which reinsurance is ceded to other insurers. for further discussion on reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md a capital markets risk management - reinsurance. investment operations the company investment portfolios are primarily divided between life and property casualty and are managed by hartford investment management company ( himco ). himco manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the company various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. the risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment grade holdings and foreign currency exposure. the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the company results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. for further discussion of himco portfolio management approach, see part ii, item 7, md a investment credit risk. in addition to managing the general account assets of the company, himco is also an sec registered investment advisor for third-party institutional clients, a sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital markets transactions. himco specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active management within a disciplined risk framework to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of himco total assets under management was approximately $144.0 billion and $138.8 billion, respectively, of which $8.1 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, were held in himco managed third party accounts. 13 table of contents regulation and premium rates insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states. the extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the hartford. this legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department prior approval. in the jurisdictions in which the company insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of the hartford outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory filings. the extent of insurance regulation on business outside the united states varies significantly among the countries in which the hartford operates. some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate insurers extensively. foreign insurers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. the hartford international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective countries. in 2009, the company acquired federal trust corporation, a thrift holding company, and as a result is subject to regulations by the office of thrift supervision. also, as a result of the company participation in the capital purchase program, it is subject to certain restrictions and oversight by the u.s. treasury. intellectual property we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. we have a worldwide trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the hartford name, the stag logo and the combination of these two marks. the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. we regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. employees the hartford had approximately 28,000 employees as of december 31, 2009. available information the hartford makes available, free of charge, on or through its internet website (http://www.thehartford.com) the hartford annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after the hartford electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the sec. 14 table of contents item 1a. risk factors investing in the hartford involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the sec. our operating environment remains challenging in light of uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery and the impact of governmental budgetary and regulatory initiatives. the steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate to mitigate the financial, competitive and other risks associated with our operating environment, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate from their current levels or regulatory requirements change significantly, and we may be required to or we may seek to raise additional capital or take other strategic or financial actions that could adversely affect our business and results or trading prices for our common stock. persistent volatility in financial markets and uncertainty about the timing and strength of a recovery in the global economy adversely affected our business and results in 2009, and we believe that these conditions may continue to affect our operating environment in 2010. high unemployment, lower family income, lower business investment and lower consumer spending in most geographic markets we serve have adversely affected the demand for financial and insurance products, as well as their profitability in some cases. our results, financial condition and statutory capital remain sensitive to equity and credit market performance, and we expect that market volatility will continue to pressure returns in our life and property and casualty investment portfolios and that our hedging costs will remain high. until economic conditions become more stable and improve, we also expect to experience realized and unrealized investment losses, particularly in the commercial real estate sector where significant market illiquidity and risk premiums exist that reflect the current uncertainty in the real estate market. deterioration or negative rating agency actions with respect to our investments, or our own credit and financial strength ratings, could also indirectly adversely affect our statutory capital and rbc ratios, which could in turn have other negative consequences for our business and results. the steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate if economic conditions do not stabilize in line with our forecasts or if they experience a significant deterioration. these steps include ongoing initiatives, particularly those relating to repositioning our investment portfolios, so we are also exposed to significant execution risk. in addition, we have modified our variable annuity product offerings and, in october 2009, launched a new variable annuity product. however, the future success of this new variable annuity product will be dependent on market acceptance. the level of market acceptance of this new product will directly affect the level of variable annuity sales of the company in the future. if our actions are not adequate, our ability to support the scale of our business and to absorb operating losses and liabilities under our customer contracts could be impaired, which would in turn adversely affect our overall competitiveness. we could be required to raise additional capital or consider other actions to manage our capital position and liquidity or further reduce our exposure to market and financial risks. while we participated in the capital purchase program (the cpp ) of the u.s. treasury department ( treasury ) as a means to strengthen our capital position, we may seek to repay those funds, which would also likely require us to raise capital. any capital that we raise may be on terms that are dilutive to shareholders or otherwise unfavorable to us. we may also be forced to sell assets on unfavorable terms that could cause us to incur charges or lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery. we could also face other pressures, such as employee recruitment and retention issues and potential loss of distributors for our products. finally, trading prices for our common stock could decline as a result or in anticipation of sales of our common stock or equity-linked instruments. even if the measures we have taken (or take in the future) are effective to mitigate the risks associated with our current operating environment, they may have unintended consequences. for example, rebalancing our hedging program may better protect our statutory surplus, but also results in greater u.s. gaap earnings volatility. actions we take may also entail impairment or other charges or adversely affect our ability to compete successfully in an increasingly difficult consumer market. regulatory developments relating to the recent financial crisis may also significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. u.s. and overseas governmental or regulatory authorities, including the sec, the office of thrift supervision ( ots ), the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) or the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. new regulations will likely affect critical matters, including capital requirements, and published proposals by insurance regulatory authorities that could reduce the pressure on our capital position may not be adopted or may be adopted in a form that does not afford as much capital relief as anticipated. if we fail to manage the impact of these developments effectively, our prospects, results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and global real estate market deterioration which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and global real estate market deterioration. 15 table of contents one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our life businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. the decline in equity markets over the last two years has significantly reduced assets under management and related fee income during that period. in addition, certain of our life products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure should equity markets decline. due to declines in equity markets, our liability for these guaranteed benefits has significantly increased and our statutory capital position has decreased. further sustained declines in equity markets may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support these products. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns are likely to have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans. our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six-to-twelve month time period, certain of our life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. an increase in interest rates can also impact our tax planning strategies and in particular our ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our life businesses, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. in other situations, declines in interest rates or changes in credit spreads may result in reducing the duration of certain life liabilities, creating asset liability duration mismatches and lower spread income. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. if issuer credit spreads widen significantly or retain historically wide levels over an extended period of time, additional other-than-temporary impairments and increases in the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio will likely result. in addition, losses have also occurred due to the volatility in credit spreads. when credit spreads widen, we incur losses associated with the credit derivatives where the company assumes exposure. when credit spreads tighten, we incur losses associated with derivatives where the company has purchased credit protection. if credit spreads tighten significantly, the company net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity can make it difficult to value certain of our securities when trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period-to-period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ( mva ) annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the u.s. and japanese libor in japan. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the u.s. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the u.s. or japanese libor in japan, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this has resulted and may continue to result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the product. our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations, non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, our yen-denominated individual fixed annuity product, and certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan and u.k. variable annuities. these risks relate to potential decreases in value and income resulting from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product. in comparison, certain of our life products offer guaranteed benefits which could substantially increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure should the yen strengthen versus other currencies. correspondingly, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to other currencies will increase our exposure to the u.s. variable annuity guarantee benefits where policyholders have elected to invest in international funds. our real estate market exposure includes investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities ( cmbs ), residential mortgage-backed securities ( rmbs ), commercial real estate ( cre ) collateralized debt obligations ( cdos ), mortgage and real estate partnerships, and mortgage loans. the recent deterioration in the global real estate market, as evidenced by increases in property vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures, has negatively impacted property values and sources of refinancing resulting in market illiquidity and risk premiums that reflect the current uncertainty in the real estate market. should these trends continue, further reductions in net investment income associated with real estate partnerships, impairments of real estate backed securities and increases in our valuation allowance for mortgage loans may result. 16 table of contents if significant, further declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads, the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, and global real estate market deterioration, individually or in combination, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity both directly and indirectly by creating competitive and other pressures including, but not limited to, employee retention issues and the potential loss of distributors for our products. in addition, in the conduct of our business, there could be scenarios where in order to reduce risks, fulfill our obligations or to raise incremental liquidity, we would sell assets at a loss. declines in equity markets, changes in interest rates and credit spreads and global real estate market deterioration can also negatively impact the fair values of each of our segments. if a significant decline in the fair value of a segment occurred and this resulted in an excess of that segment book value over fair value, the goodwill assigned to that segment might be impaired and could cause the company to record a charge to impair a part or all of the related goodwill assets. our adjustment of our risk management program relating to products we offer with guaranteed benefits to emphasize protection of statutory surplus will likely result in greater u.s. gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income in periods of rising equity market pricing levels. some of the products offered by our life businesses, especially variable annuities, offer certain guaranteed benefits which, in the event of a decline in equity markets, would not only result in lower earnings, but will also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we are also subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, especially the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ( gmab ), guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) offered with variable annuity products. as of december 31, 2009, the net liability for gmwb and gmab was $2.0 billion. at that date, the liability for gmib and gmdb was a combined $989, net of reinsurance. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. however, due to the severe economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008, we adjusted our risk management program to place greater relative emphasis on the protection of statutory surplus. this shift in relative emphasis has resulted in greater u.s. gaap earnings volatility in 2009 and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income in periods of rising equity market pricing levels. while we believe that these actions have improved the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. we are also subject to the risk that other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the amount of statutory capital that we have and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market, interest rate and foreign currency conditions, changes in policyholder behavior and changes in rating agency models. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital ( rbc ) formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company control. the company financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios will generally increase, however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and rbc requirements could increase resulting in lower rbc ratios. due to all of these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. in 2009, our financial strength and credit ratings were downgraded by multiple rating agencies. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be further downgraded by one or more rating agencies. 17 table of contents we have experienced and may experience additional future downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. in 2009, our financial strength and credit ratings were downgraded by multiple rating agencies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, at their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or an announced potential further downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products. our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or an announced potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, and separate account assets. the company is required to categorize these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). in many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability position may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in these situations, the company will determine the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. the determination of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, more securities may fall to level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment. as such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation thereby resulting in values that may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. as of december 31, 2009, 9%, 75% and 16% of our available for sale securities and short-term investments were considered to be level 1, 2 and 3, respectively. evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether a credit and/or non-credit impairment exists and whether an impairment should be recognized in current period earnings or in other comprehensive income. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company currently uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. 18 table of contents additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost; changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer; whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments; changes in the financial condition of the security underlying collateral; the payment structure of the security; the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, commercial and residential property value declines that vary by property type and location and average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year; other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies; our intent to sell a debt or an equity security with debt-like characteristics (collectively, debt security ) or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery; and our intent and ability to retain an equity security without debt-like characteristics for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value. during 2009, the company recognized $1.5 billion of impairment losses in earnings. additional impairments may be recorded in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results and financial condition. losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities (which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities or other high yielding bonds) mortgage loans or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities or loans may deteriorate causing these securities or loans to incur losses. our investment portfolio includes securities backed by real estate assets that have been adversely impacted due to the recent recessionary period and the associated property value declines, resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flow for certain securities. additional significant property value declines and loss rates, which exceed our current estimates, as outlined in part ii, item 7, md a investment credit risk other-than-temporary impairments, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company stockholders equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government. however, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, the company credit concentration risk could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. 19 table of contents if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company defers acquisition costs associated with the sales of its universal and variable life and variable annuity products. these costs are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and gmib using components of egps. the projection of estimated gross profits requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns in excess of amounts credited to policyholders, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin (including impairments), mortality, and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques, could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate, if significant impairment charges are anticipated or if significant or sustained equity market declines persist, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb and gmib which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. for 2009, the company recorded a $1.0 billion, after-tax, charge related to the dac unlock. if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the company to limit risk. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains, to offset previously recognized capital losses, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. however, we anticipate limited ability, going forward, to recognize a full tax benefit on certain realized capital losses. therefore, if based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. our valuation allowance of $86, as of december 31, 2009, based on future facts and circumstances may not be sufficient. charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 is also limited. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or periods affected and, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 20 table of contents it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made, the occurrence of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations and liquidity. our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. we also face substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism, disease pandemics and political instability. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. starting in 2004 and 2005, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events have incorporated medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity reflecting the potential influence of multi-decadal climate patterns within the atlantic. in addition, changing climate conditions across longer time scales, including the potential risk of broader climate change, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of certain natural catastrophe losses across various geographic regions. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. potential examples of the impact of climate change on catastrophe exposure include, but are not limited to the following: an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere, more frequent brush fires in certain geographies due to prolonged periods of drought, higher incidence of deluge flooding, and the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. our life insurance operations are also exposed to risk of loss from catastrophes. for example, natural or man-made disasters or a disease pandemic such as could arise from avian flu, could significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience. policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment products. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations and cash flows. to the extent that loss experience unfolds or models improve, we will seek to reflect any increased risk in the design and pricing of our products. however, the company may be exposed to regulatory or legislative actions that prevent a full accounting of loss expectations in the design or price of our products or result in additional risk-shifting to the insurance industry. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes or mortality, or other events that can cause unfavorable results of operations, through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. historically, reinsurance pricing has changed significantly from time to time. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. 21 table of contents our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. in recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services firms that market products and services similar to ours. the current economic environment has only served to further increase competition. many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. these competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents and for our employees. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. in addition, as actual or potential future downgrades occur, and if our competitors have not been similarly downgraded, sales of our products could be significantly reduced. because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our participation in the cpp subjects us to additional restrictions, oversight and cost that could materially affect our business, results and prospects. although participation in the cpp has been an important component of our strategy to enhance our capital position and financial flexibility, our continued participation subjects us to additional restrictions, oversight and costs, and has other potential consequences, that could materially affect our business, results and prospects, including the following: our continued participation in the cpp, even as other financial institutions have repaid their government assistance, may cause us to be perceived as having greater capital needs and weaker overall financial prospects than those of our competitors that have not participated in the cpp, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results, including new product sales and policy retention rates, and affect trading prices for our common stock. as a condition to our participation in cpp, we acquired federal trust corporation, the parent company of federal trust bank ( ftb ), a federally chartered, fdic-insured thrift. as a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the ots and ots reporting requirements. all of our activities must be financially-related activities as defined by federal law (which includes insurance activities), and ots has enforcement authority over us, including the right to pursue administrative orders or penalties and the right to restrict or prohibit activities determined by ots to be a serious risk to ftb. we must also be a source of strength to ftb, which could require further capital contributions. receipt of cpp funds subjects us to restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an adverse impact on our business, results or the trading prices for our common stock. for example, we are subject to significant limitations on the amount and form of bonus, retention and other incentive compensation that we may pay to executive officers and senior management. these provisions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel. other regulatory initiatives applicable to participants in federal funding programs may also be forthcoming. compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. future federal statutes may adversely affect the terms of the cpp that are applicable to us, and the treasury may amend the terms of our agreement unilaterally if required by future statutes, including in a manner materially adverse to us. 22 table of contents while our objective is to repay the cpp funds invested in us, our ability to do so is subject to federal regulatory approvals that may impose significant conditions, including a requirement that we raise additional capital, and we cannot predict whether or when we may reach agreement with the federal regulators with respect to the terms of our repayment. our ability to raise capital as a condition to repayment will in turn depend on a variety of considerations, including our capital resources and market conditions at the time, as well as the terms on which we could raise capital, and any potential dilutive impact on shareholders. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or significant changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable law could have a similar effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves, and how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our products appropriately. our results, financial condition and liquidity could also be adversely affected if judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from current expectations. potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we are subject to extensive u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and can affect our strategy, as well as the demand for and profitability of the products we offer. there is also a risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; requiring insurers to dividend to policy holders any excess profits; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. 23 table of contents state insurance regulators and the naic regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. changes in these laws and regulations, or in the interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. compliance with these laws and regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. we distribute our annuity, life and property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through individual third-party arrangements. for example, we generated approximately 72% of our personal lines earned premium in 2009 under an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues until january 1, 2020. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity at the time it becomes known. limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. the hartford financial services group, inc. is a holding company with no significant operations. our principal asset is the stock of our insurance subsidiaries. state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments. limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to an unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. 24 table of contents additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in a number of product lines and states, we continue to experience premium rate reductions. in these product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. even in a period of rate increases, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or other unanticipated events, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain affiliated third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. our systems could also be subject to physical and electronic break-ins, and subject to similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. this may impede or interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised. we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties and expect to do so selectively in the future. if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy, third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. potential changes in federal or state tax laws, including changes impacting the availability of the separate account dividend received deduction, could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results or financial condition or liquidity. many of the products that the company sells benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company sells life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries. we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. other products that the company sells also enjoy similar, as well as other, types of tax advantages. the company also benefits from certain tax benefits, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. due in large part to the recent financial crisis that has affected many governments, there is an increasing risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and/or their policyholders. although the specific form of any such potential legislation is uncertain, it could include lessening or eliminating some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company or its policyholders including, but not limited to, those mentioned above. this could occur in the context of deficit reduction or other tax reforms. the effects of any such changes could result in materially lower product sales, lapses of policies currently held, and/or our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes. changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. u.s. gaap and related financial reporting requirements are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by the relevant authoritative bodies. such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. changes in u.s. gaap and financial reporting requirements, or in the interpretation of u.s. gaap or those requirements, could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. 25 table of contents we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is set forth in the capital markets risk management section of item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is incorporated herein by reference.risk

(dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated) general the hartford financial services group, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the hartford or the company ) is an insurance and financial services company. the hartford, headquartered in connecticut, is among the largest providers of investment products and life, property, and casualty insurance to both individual and business customers in the united states of america. also, the hartford continues to administer business previously sold in japan and the united kingdom. hartford fire insurance company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of the hartford subsidiaries. at december 31, 2010, total assets and total stockholders equity of the hartford were $318.3 billion and $20.3 billion, respectively. organization the hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry. the company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to consumers and businesses. the company is continuously seeking to develop and expand its distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies of scale and improved technology, and capitalizes on its brand name and the hartford stag logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry. in 2009, the company announced it would focus on its u.s. businesses and suspended sales in japan and the united kingdom. in 2010, the company announced a customer-oriented strategy and established three divisions commercial markets, consumer markets, and wealth management. in 2010, the company announced the sale of two businesses that are not core to its focus and strategy: its canadian mutual fund business, hartford investments canada corporation, and specialty risk services, llc, a third-party administrator for claims administration (scheduled to close in 2011). going forward, the company intends to continue evaluating its businesses and may make additional divestitures of businesses and assets that are outside its focus or not necessary to the implementation of its strategy. as a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, the hartford financial services group, inc. has no significant business operations of its own. therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations. additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the hartford financial services group, inc. may be found in the capital resources and liquidity section of part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md a ). the company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the company, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to the hartford mutual funds, inc. and the hartford mutual funds ii, inc. (collectively, mutual funds ), consisting of 52 mutual funds, as of december 31, 2010. the company charges fees to these mutual funds, which are recorded as revenue by the company. these mutual funds are registered with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) under the investment company act of 1940. the mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the company. reporting segments the hartford made changes to its reporting segments in 2010 to reflect the manner in which the company is currently organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. accordingly, segment data for prior reporting periods has been adjusted to reflect the new segment reporting. as a result, the company created three customer-oriented divisions, commercial markets, consumer markets and wealth management, conducting business principally in seven reporting segments. the hartford includes in corporate and other the company debt financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities; banking operations; certain fee income and commission expenses associated with sales of non-proprietary products by broker-dealer subsidiaries; and certain purchase accounting adjustments and other charges not allocated to the reporting segments. also included in corporate and other is the company management of certain property and casualty operations that have discontinued writing new business and substantially all of the company asbestos and environmental exposures, collectively referred to as other operations. the following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of each of the three divisions of the hartford. for further discussion on changes to reporting segments in 2010, as well as financial disclosures on revenues by product, net income (loss), and assets for each reporting segment, see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 5 table of contents commercial markets the commercial markets division is organized into two reporting segments; property casualty commercial and group benefits. principal products and services property casualty commercial provides workers compensation, property, automobile, liability and umbrella coverages under several different products, primarily throughout the u.s, within its standard commercial lines, which consists of the hartford small commercial and middle market lines of business. additionally, a variety of customized insurance products and risk management services including workers compensation, automobile, general liability, professional liability, fidelity, surety and specialty casualty coverages are offered to large companies through the segment specialty lines. standard commercial lines seeks to offer products with more coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder individualized risk characteristics. for small businesses, those businesses whose annual payroll is under $5 and whose revenue and property values are less than $15 each, coverages are bundled as part of a single multi-peril package policy marketed under the spectrum name. medium-sized businesses, companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed the small business definition, are served within middle market. the middle market line of business provides workers compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, marine and livestock coverages. the sale of spectrum business owners package policies and workers compensation policies accounts for the majority of the written premium in the standard commercial lines. within the specialty lines, a significant portion of the specialty casualty business, including workers compensation business, is written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides collateral to support loss payments made within their deductible. the specialty casualty business also provides retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. captive and specialty programs provide insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups. in addition, specialty lines has provided third-party administrator services for claims administration, integrated benefits and loss control through specialty risk services, llc ( srs ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. the company signed a definitive agreement on december 17, 2010 to sell srs. group benefits provides group life, accident and disability coverage, group retiree health and voluntary benefits to individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions. group benefits offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. policies sold in this segment are generally term insurance, allowing group benefits to adjust the rates or terms of its policies in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, declining interest rates, and other factors. policies are typically sold with one, two or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product. in addition to the products and services traditionally offered within each of its lines of business, in 2010 commercial markets launched the hartford productivity advantage ( thpa ), a single-company solution for leave management, integrating the insurer short- and long-term group disability and workers compensation insurance with its leave management administration services. marketing and distribution standard commercial lines provide insurance products and services through the company home office located in hartford, connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. the products are marketed nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. the current pace of consolidation within the independent agent and broker distribution channel will likely continue such that, in the future a larger proportion of written premium will likely be concentrated among fewer agents and brokers. additionally the company offers insurance products to customers of the payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies. specialty lines also provide insurance products and services through its home office located in hartford, connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. specialty lines markets its products nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent retail agents, brokers and wholesalers. the group benefits distribution network includes an experienced group of company employees, managed through a regional sales office system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. during 2010 the company launched a nationwide joint sales management effort across standard commercial lines, specialty lines and group benefits, facilitating the marketing of both integrated and traditional products and services across commercial markets. 6 table of contents competition in the small commercial marketplace, the hartford competes against a number of large national carriers, as well as regional competitors in certain territories. competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. the small commercial market has become increasingly competitive as favorable loss costs in the past few years have led carriers to differentiate themselves through product expansion, price reduction, enhanced service and cutting-edge technology. larger carriers such as the hartford have improved their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with agents through the use of predictive modeling tools and automation which speeds up the process of evaluating a risk and quoting new business. written premium growth rates in the small commercial market have slowed and underwriting margins have deteriorated due to earned pricing decreases, economy-related exposure reductions and increases in loss cost severity. a number of companies have sought to grow their business by increasing their underwriting appetite, appointing new agents and expanding business with existing agents. also, carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more aggressively competing for small commercial accounts as small commercial business has generally been less price-sensitive. middle market business is characterized as high touch and involves case-by-case underwriting and pricing decisions. compared to small commercial lines, the pricing of middle market accounts is prone to more significant variation or cyclicality over time, with more sensitivity to legislative and macro-economic forces. the economic downturn which began in 2008 has driven a reduction in average premium size as shrinking company payrolls, smaller auto fleets, and fewer business locations depress insurance exposures. additionally, various state legislative reforms in recent years designed to control workers compensation indemnity costs have led to rate reductions in many states. these factors coupled with soft market conditions, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have resulted in more new business opportunities in the marketplace as customers shop their policies for a better price. in the face of this competitive environment, the hartford continues to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. to gain a competitive advantage in this environment, carriers are improving automation with agents and brokers, increasing pricing sophistication, and enhancing their product offerings. these enhancements include industry specialization, with the hartford and other national carriers tailoring products and services to specific industry verticals such as technology, health care and renewable energy. specialty lines is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that operate independently within their specific industries. these businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have different business models and operating cycles. specialty lines competes on an account- by-account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction. competition in this market includes other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the hartford provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. disciplined underwriting and targeted returns are the objectives of specialty lines since premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment view of perceived market opportunity. for specialty casualty businesses, written pricing competition continues to be significant, particularly for the larger individual accounts. carriers are protecting their in-force casualty business by initiating the renewal process well in advance of the policy renewal date, effectively preventing other carriers from quoting on the business and resulting in fewer new business opportunities within the marketplace. within the national account business, as the market continues to soften, more insureds may opt for guaranteed cost policies in lieu of loss-sensitive products. carriers writing professional liability business are increasingly focused on profitable private, middle market companies. this trend has continued as the downturn in the economy has led to a significant drop in the number of initial public offerings, and volatility for all public companies. also, carriers new business opportunities in the marketplace for directors officers and errors omissions insurance have been significantly influenced by customer perceptions of financial strength, as investment portfolio losses have had a negative affect on the financial strength ratings of some insurers. in the surety business, favorable underwriting results over the past couple of years has led to increased competition for market share, setting the stage for potential written price declines and less favorable terms and conditions. driven by the upheaval in the credit markets, new private construction activity has declined dramatically, resulting in lower demand for contract surety business. group benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. this line of business focuses on both its risk management expertise and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. competitive factors affecting group benefits include the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for coverage and services, the company relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of customer service. in addition, active price competition continues in the marketplace resulting in longer rate guarantee periods being offered to customers. top tier carriers in the marketplace also offer on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the group benefits business provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. in the commercial marketplace, generally soft market conditions and a weak economy has prompted carriers to offer differentiated products and services as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. in addition to the initiatives specific to each of the hartford commercial markets lines of business noted above, the company is leveraging its diverse product, service and distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated value in the market, while simultaneously increasing its ability to access to its own diverse customer base. 7 table of contents consumer markets the consumer markets division constitutes the reporting segment. principal products and services consumer markets provides standard automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages to individuals across the united states, including a special program designed exclusively for members of aarp ( aarp program ). the hartford auto and homeowners products provide coverage options and customized pricing tailored to a customer individual risk although the hartford has individual customer relationships with aarp program policyholders, as a group these customers represent a significant portion of the total consumer markets business. business sold direct to aarp members amounted to earned premiums of $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. consumer markets also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through the aarp health program, which is in place through 2018. marketing and distribution consumer markets reaches diverse customers through multiple distribution channels including direct sales to the consumer, brokers and independent agents. in direct sales to the consumer, the company markets its products through a mix of media, including direct marketing, the internet and advertising in publications. most of consumer markets direct sales to the consumer are associated with its exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp to market automobile, homeowners and home-based business insurance products to aarp nearly 37 million members. the hartford exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp continues until january 1, 2020 for automobile, homeowners and home-based business. this agreement provides consumer markets with an important competitive advantage given the number of baby boomers over age 50 many of whom become aarp members during this period. the agency channel provides customized products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market. these independent agents are not employees of the hartford. an important strategic objective of the company is to develop common products and processes for all of its personal lines business regardless of the distribution channel. in 2010, the company continued the rollout of its new open road advantage product and, as of december 31, 2010, this product was sold in 33 states across the company distribution channels, including directly to aarp members, through independent agents to both aarp members and non-members and directly to non-members. in 2009, consumer markets piloted mass marketing direct to the consumer without the benefit of an affinity partnership. in 2010, consumer markets changed its strategy away from mass marketing to targeting specific customer groups, including individuals in the over 40 age group, and writing business through affinities other than aarp. the company entered into an affinity agreement with american kennel club effective january 1, 2011 and expects to enter into additional affinity arrangements in 2011. competition the personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete on the basis of price, product, service (including claims handling), stability of the insurer and brand recognition. companies with recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. in recent years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and retain profitable business. this has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the consumer. industry sales of personal lines insurance direct to the consumer have been growing faster than sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance. carriers that distribute products mainly through agents have been competing by offering agents increased commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. more agents have been using comparative rater tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. the use of comparative rater tools has further increased price competition. carriers with more efficient cost structures will have an advantage in competing for new business through price. the use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business and, carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. some companies, including the hartford, have written a greater percentage of their new business in preferred market segments which tend to have better loss experience but also lower average premiums. wealth management the wealth management division consists of the following reporting segments: global annuity, life insurance, retirement plans and mutual funds. wealth management provides investment products for over 7 million customers and life insurance for approximately 716,000 customers. as part of the company strategic decision to focus on its u.s. businesses, the company suspended all new sales in its japan and european operations in the second quarter of 2009 and divested its brazil joint venture, canadian mutual fund business and its offshore insurance business in 2010. 8 table of contents principal products and services global annuity offers individual variable, fixed market value adjusted ( fixed mva ) and single premium immediate annuities in the u.s., a range of products to institutional investors, including but not limited to, stable value contracts and institutional annuities, and administers investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to individuals and groups outside the u.s., primarily in japan and europe. life insurance sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life, universal life, and term life, as well as variable private placement life insurance ( ppli ) owned by corporations and high net worth individuals. retirement plans provides products and services to corporations, municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations pursuant to sections 401(k), 457 and 403(b) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ), respectively. mutual funds offers retail mutual funds, investment-only mutual funds and college savings plans under section 529 of the code (collectively referred to as non-proprietary) and proprietary mutual funds. marketing and distribution global annuity distribution network includes national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and independent financial advisors. the company periodically negotiates provisions and terms of its relationships with unaffiliated parties. the company primary wholesaler of its individual annuities is hartford life distributors, llc, and its affiliate, planco, llc (collectively hld ) which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of hartford life, inc. hld provides sales support to registered representatives, financial planners and broker-dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the united states. life insurance distribution network includes national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks, independent agents, independent life and property-casualty agents, and woodbury financial services, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary retail broker-dealer. ppli distribution network includes: specialized brokers with expertise in the large case market; financial advisors that work with individual investors; investment banking and wealth management specialists; benefits consulting firms; investment consulting firms employed by retirement plan sponsors; and the hartford employees. retirement plans distribution network includes company employees with extensive retirement experience selling its products and services through national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and other financial institutions. mutual fund sales professionals are segmented into two teams; a retail team and an institutional team. the retail team distributes the hartford open-end funds and 529 college savings funds to national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions, independent financial advisors and registered investment advisors. the institutional team distributes the hartford funds to professional buyers, such as broker-dealer wrap, consultants, record keepers, and bank trust groups. competition global annuity competes with other life insurance companies, as well as certain banks, securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors, asset managers, and other financial intermediaries marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. product sales are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and credited rates, reputation and customer service. global annuity u.s. annuity deposits continue to decline due to competitive activity and the company product and risk decisions. many competitors have responded to the equity market volatility by increasing the price of their living benefit products and changing the level of the guarantee offered. management believes that the most significant industry de-risking changes have occurred. in 2010, the company transitioned to a new variable annuity product designed to meet customers future income needs while abiding by the risk tolerances of the company. life insurance competes with other life insurance companies in the united states, as well as other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. product sales are affected primarily by the availability and price of reinsurance, volatility in the equity markets, breadth and quality of life insurance products being offered, pricing, relationships with third-party distributors, effectiveness of wholesaling support, and the quality of underwriting and customer service. the individual life industry continues to see a distribution shift away from the traditional life insurance sales agents to the consultative financial advisor as the place people go to buy their life insurance. life insurance regional sales office system is a differentiator in the market and allows it to compete effectively across multiple distribution outlets. retirement plans compete with other insurance carriers, large investment brokerage companies and large mutual fund companies. the 401(k), 457, and 403(b) products offer mutual funds wrapped in variable annuities, variable funding agreements, or mutual fund retirement products. plan sponsors seek a diversity of available funds and favorable fund performance. consolidation among industry providers has continued as competitors increase scale advantages. mutual funds compete with other mutual fund companies along with investment brokerage companies and differentiate themselves through product solutions, performance, and service. in this non-proprietary broker sold market, the company and its competitors compete aggressively for net sales. 9 table of contents reserves the hartford establishes and carries as liabilities reserves for its insurance products to estimate for the following: a liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, as well as estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims; a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the wealth management insurance policyholder as of the consolidated financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value; a liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; fair value reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and death and living benefit reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. further discussion of the hartford property and casualty insurance product reserves, including asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in part ii, item 7, md a critical accounting estimates property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance. additional discussion may be found in the company accounting policies for insurance product reserves within note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. reinsurance the hartford cedes insurance risk to reinsurance companies for both its property and casualty and life insurance products. ceded reinsurance does not relieve the hartford of its primary liability and, as such, failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the hartford. for further discussion, see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. for property and casualty insurance products, reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater diversification of business and limit the hartford maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. a major portion of the hartford property and casualty insurance product reinsurance is effected under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. the hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses over stipulated amounts. for further discussion on property and casualty insurance product reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md a insurance risk reinsurance. for life insurance products, the hartford is involved in both the cession and assumption of insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, the company policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any one of its operations was $10. the company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers. for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company did not make any significant changes in the terms under which reinsurance is ceded to other insurers. in addition, the company has reinsured a portion of the risk associated with u.s. minimum death benefit guarantees, japan guaranteed minimum death, as well as u.s. guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits offered in connection with its variable annuity contracts. for further discussion on reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md a market risk variable product equity risk. investment operations the majority of the company investment portfolios are managed by hartford investment management company ( himco ). himco manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the company various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. the risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment grade holdings and foreign currency exposure. the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the company results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. for further discussion of himco portfolio management approach, see the investment credit risk section of the md a. in addition to managing the general account assets of the company, himco is also a sec registered investment adviser for third party institutional clients, a sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital markets transactions. himco specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active management within a disciplined risk framework that seeks to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of himco total assets under management was approximately $159.7 billion and $144.0 billion, respectively, of which $8.7 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, were held in himco managed third party accounts. 10 table of contents risk management the company has an independent enterprise risk management function ( erm ) whose responsibility it is to provide a comprehensive, in depth, and transparent view of the company risk on an aggregated basis and to ensure the company risks remain within tolerance. erm is led by the chief risk officer who reports to the chief executive officer. erm is staffed with risk professionals focused on insurance risk, investment risk, market risk, and operational risk. the mission of erm is to support the company in achieving its strategic priorities within an agreed upon risk profile by providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the company, including risk concentrations and correlations; helping management define the company risk tolerances through the evaluation of the risk return profile of the business relative to the company strategic intent and financial underpinnings; and monitoring and communicating the company risk exposures relative to set tolerances and recommending/implementing appropriate mitigation where applicable. the company maintains an internal enterprise risk and capital committee ( ercc ), which includes the company chief executive officer ( ceo ), chief risk officer, chief financial officer, chief investment officer, the presidents and chief operating officers of commercial markets, consumer markets, and wealth management and the company general counsel. the ercc, which is chaired by the ceo, meets regularly to manage the company strategic risk profile and risk management activities across the organization; approve financial and investment strategies along with the methodology to attribute capital among business lines; determine the company capital structure; and establish the company risk management framework, limits, and standards. the board as a whole has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight. it exercises its oversight function through its standing committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. the finance, investment and risk management committee ( firmco ), which consists of all members of the board, has responsibility for oversight of all risks that do not fall within the oversight responsibility of any other standing committee. together, these committees oversee and assess general risk management activities, investment activities and financial management of the company and its subsidiaries. they review the company risk management framework and enterprise policies related to governance and provide a forum for discussion between management and the board on risk and risk-related matters. regulation insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states. the extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the hartford. this legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department prior approval. in the jurisdictions in which the company insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of the hartford outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory filings. certain of the company life insurance subsidiaries sell variable life insurance, variable annuity, and some fixed guaranteed products that are securities registered with the sec under the securities act of 1933, as amended. some of the products have separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of 1940 and/or are regulated by state law. separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation. moreover, each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, some of which invest in underlying mutual funds which are themselves registered as investment companies under the investment company act of 1940 ( underlying funds ). the company offers these underlying funds and retail mutual funds that are registered with and regulated by the sec. in addition, other subsidiaries of the company are involved in the offering, selling and distribution of the company variable insurance products, underlying funds and retail mutual funds as broker dealers and are subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), the sec and/or in, some instances, state securities administrators. other entities operate as investment advisers registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. one subsidiary is an investment company registered under the investment company act of 1940. because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. some of these regulations include among other things regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers funds, corporate governance, capital, record keeping, and reporting requirements. 11 table of contents the extent of insurance regulation on business outside the united states varies significantly among the countries in which the hartford operates. some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate insurers extensively. foreign insurers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. the hartford international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective countries. in 2009, the company acquired federal trust corporation, a thrift holding company, and as a result is subject to regulations by the office of thrift supervision ( ots ). under the dodd-frank act, the ots will be dissolved. the federal reserve will assume regulatory authority over our holding company, and our thrift subsidiary, federal trust bank, will be regulated by the office of controller of the currency ( occ ). failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees. we cannot predict the impact of these actions on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. intellectual property we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. we have a worldwide trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the hartford name, the stag logo and the combination of these two marks. the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. we regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. employees the hartford had approximately 26,800 employees as of december 31, 2010. available information the hartford makes available, free of charge, on or through its internet website (http://www.thehartford.com) the hartford annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after the hartford electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the sec. these reports may be read and copied at the sec public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549 or by calling the sec at 1-800-sec-0330. in addition the sec maintains an internet website (http://sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec. 12 table of contents item 1a. risk factors investing in the hartford involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). our operating environment remains subject to uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery. the steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate to mitigate the financial, competitive and other risks associated with our operating environment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. uncertainty about the timing and strength of a recovery in the global economy continued to affect our operating environment in 2010. high unemployment, lower family income, lower business investment and lower consumer spending in most geographic markets we serve have adversely affected the demand for financial and insurance products, as well as their profitability in some cases. our results, financial condition and statutory capital remain sensitive to equity and credit market performance and effects of foreign currency, and we expect that market conditions will put pressure on returns in our life and property and casualty investment portfolios and that our hedging costs will remain higher than historical levels. unless all economic conditions continue to improve, we would expect to experience realized and unrealized investment losses, particularly in the commercial real estate sector where market value declines and risk premiums still exist, which reflects the future uncertainty in the real estate market. negative rating agency actions with respect to our investments could also indirectly adversely affect our statutory capital and risk-based capital ( rbc ) ratios, which could in turn have other negative consequences for our business and results. the steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate if economic conditions do not continue to improve in line with our forecasts. these steps include ongoing initiatives, particularly the execution risk relating to the continued repositioning of our investment portfolios and the continuing realignment of our macro hedge programs for our variable annuity business. in addition, we modified our variable annuity product offerings, launching a new variable annuity product in october 2009, and a second variable annuity product launch expected in the second quarter of 2011. however, the future success of these new variable annuity products will be dependent on market acceptance. the level of market acceptance of these new products will directly affect the level of variable annuity sales of the company in the future. in addition, as the company and our distribution partners transition to these new products, there will be downward pressure on new deposits, and management expects to continue to be in a net outflow position. if our actions are not adequate, our ability to support the scale of our business and to absorb operating losses and liabilities under our customer contracts could be impaired, which would in turn adversely affect our overall competitiveness and the capital position of the company. even if the measures we have taken (or take in the future) are effective to mitigate the risks associated with our current operating environment, they may have unintended consequences. for example, rebalancing our hedging program may better protect our statutory surplus, but also result in greater earnings volatility under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ( u.s. gaap ). we could be required to consider actions to manage our capital position and liquidity or further reduce our exposure to market and financial risks. we may also be forced to sell assets on unfavorable terms that could cause us to incur charges or lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery. we could also face other pressures, such as employee recruitment and retention issues and potential loss of distribution for our products. additionally, if there was concern over the company capital position creating an anticipation of the company issuing additional common stock or equity linked instruments, trading prices for our common stock could decline. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and global real estate market deterioration that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and global real estate market deterioration. one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our wealth management businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. should equity markets decline from current levels, assets under management and related fee income will be reduced. in addition, certain of our products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure should equity markets decline. sustained declines in equity markets may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support these products. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns are likely to have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans. 13 table of contents our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six-to-twelve month time period, certain of our wealth management businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. although our products have features such as surrender charges, market-value adjustments and put options on certain retirement plans, we are subject to disintermediation risk. an increase in interest rates can also impact our tax planning strategies and in particular our ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. in a declining rate environment, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our life businesses, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks, increased hedging costs, spread compression and capital volatility. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. if issuer credit spreads widen significantly or retain historically wide levels over an extended period of time, additional other-than-temporary impairments and increases in the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio will likely result. in addition, losses have also occurred due to the volatility in credit spreads. when credit spreads widen, we incur losses associated with the credit derivatives where the company assumes exposure. when credit spreads tighten, we incur losses associated with derivatives where the company has purchased credit protection. if credit spreads tighten significantly, the company net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity can make it difficult to value certain of our securities when trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed mva annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the u.s. and japanese libor in japan. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the u.s. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the u.s. or japanese libor in japan, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this has resulted and may continue to result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product. our primary foreign currency exchange risk is related to certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan and u.k. variable annuities. the strengthening of the yen compared with other currencies will substantially increase our exposure to pay yen denominated obligations. in addition our foreign currency exchange risk relates to net income from foreign operations, non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, and our yen-denominated individual fixed annuity product. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated annuity products. a strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to foreign currencies will increase our exposure to the u.s. variable annuity guarantee benefits where policyholders have elected to invest in international funds, generating losses and statutory surplus strain. our real estate market exposure includes investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations, mortgage and real estate partnerships, and mortgage loans. significant deterioration in the real estate market in the past couple of years adversely affected our business and results of operations. further deterioration in the real estate market, including increases in property vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures, could have a negative impact on property values and sources of refinancing resulting in reduced market liquidity and higher risk premiums. this could result in impairments of real estate backed securities, a reduction in net investment income associated with real estate partnerships, and increases in our valuation allowance for mortgage loans. significant declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads, inflation, the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, or global real estate market deterioration, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 14 table of contents our adjustment of our risk management program relating to products we offer with guaranteed benefits to emphasize protection of statutory surplus will likely result in greater u.s. gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income in periods of rising equity market pricing levels. some of the products offered by our wealth management businesses, especially variable annuities, offer guaranteed benefits which, in the event of a decline in equity markets, would not only result in lower earnings, but will also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we are also subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, including the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ( gmab ), guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) offered with variable annuity products. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. however, due to the severe economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008, we adjusted our risk management program to place greater relative emphasis on the protection of statutory surplus. this shift in relative emphasis has resulted in greater u.s. gaap earnings volatility in 2009 and 2010 and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, lower interest rates, rises in implied volatility and weakening of the yen against other currencies. while we believe that these actions have improved the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. we are also subject to the risk that these management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the amount of statutory capital that we have and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market, interest rate and foreign currency conditions, changes in policyholder behavior and changes in rating agency models. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on rbc formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of internal reinsurance arrangements, and changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company control. the company financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios will generally increase. this may be offset, however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and rbc requirements could also increase, lowering rbc ratios. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, could increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. in 2009, our financial strength and credit ratings were downgraded by multiple rating agencies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, at their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. 15 table of contents our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products. our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, and separate account assets. the determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment in determining their fair values and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether a credit and/or non-credit impairment exists and whether an impairment should be recognized in current period earnings or in other comprehensive income. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company currently uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost; changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer; whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments; changes in the financial condition of the security underlying collateral; the payment structure of the security; the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, commercial and residential property value declines that vary by property type and location and average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year; other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies; our intent to sell a debt or an equity security with debt-like characteristics (collectively, debt security ) or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery; and our intent and ability to retain an equity security without debt-like characteristics for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value. impairment losses in earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. 16 table of contents losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities (which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities or other high yielding bonds) mortgage loans or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities or loans may deteriorate causing these securities or loans to incur losses. our investment portfolio includes securities backed by real estate assets the value of which have been adversely impacted by the recent recessionary period and the associated property value declines, resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flow for certain securities. further property value declines and loss rates that exceed our current estimates, as outlined in part ii, item 7, md a investment credit risk other-than-temporary impairments, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company stockholders equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government. however, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, the company credit concentration risk could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company defers acquisition costs associated with the sales of its universal and variable life and variable annuity products. these costs are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the company evaluates the egps compared to the dac asset to determine if an impairment exists. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and gmib using components of egps. the projection of estimated gross profits or components of estimated gross profits requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns in excess of amounts credited to policyholders, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin (including impairments), mortality, benefit utilization, annuitization and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques, could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including lapse rates, benefit utilization, surrenders, and annuitization, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb and gmib which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the company to limit risk. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains, to offset previously recognized capital losses, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on realized capital losses, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income. charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 17 table of contents the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 is also limited. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or periods affected and, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. for some asbestos and environmental claims, we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes, both natural and man-made, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, tornadoes, explosions, pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. starting in 2004 and 2005, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events have incorporated medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity reflecting the potential influence of multi-decadal climate patterns within the atlantic. in addition, changing climate conditions across longer time scales, including the potential risk of broader climate change, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the severity of certain natural catastrophe losses across various geographic regions. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. potential examples of the impact of climate change on catastrophe exposure include, but are not limited to the following: an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere, more frequent brush fires in certain geographies due to prolonged periods of drought, higher incidence of deluge flooding, and the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. our operations are also exposed to risk of loss from catastrophes associated with pandemics and other events that could significantly increase our mortality and morbidity exposures. policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment products. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. to the extent that loss experience unfolds or models improve, we will seek to reflect any increased risk in the design and pricing of our products. however, the company may be exposed to regulatory or legislative actions that prevent a full accounting of loss expectations in the design or price of our products or result in additional risk-shifting to the insurance industry. 18 table of contents we may incur losses due to our reinsurers unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes, or other events that can cause unfavorable results of operations, through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. historically, reinsurance pricing has changed significantly from time to time. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. in recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services firms that market products and services similar to ours. these competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents and for our employees. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. in addition, as actual or potential future downgrades occur, and if our competitors have not been affected by similar ratings actions, sales of our products could be significantly reduced. because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 19 table of contents as a savings and loan holding company, we remain subject to certain restrictions, oversight and costs that could materially affect our business, results and prospects. we are a savings and loan holding company by virtue of our ownership of federal trust bank ( ftb ), a federally chartered, fdic-insured thrift. as a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to various restrictions, oversight and costs and other potential consequences that could materially affect our business, results and prospects. for example, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the ots, including with respect to required capital, cash flow, organizational structure, risk management and earnings at the parent company level, and to the ots reporting requirements. all of our activities must be financially-related activities as defined by federal law (which includes insurance activities), and the ots has enforcement authority over us, including the right to pursue administrative orders or penalties and the right to restrict or prohibit activities determined by the ots to be a serious risk to ftb. we must also be a source of strength to ftb, which could require further capital contributions. we will be subject to similar, potentially stricter, requirements when regulatory authority over us transfers to the federal reserve (for our holding company) and the office of the controller of the currency ( occ ) (for ftb). we cannot predict the scope or impact of future regulatory initiatives, including, but not limited to, the impact on required levels of regulatory capital or the cost and complexity of our compliance programs. the impact of regulatory initiatives, including the enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ), could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity. regulatory developments relating to the recent financial crisis may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. u.s. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities, including the sec, the ots, the federal reserve, the office of the controller of the currency ( occ ), the new york stock exchange and the financial industry regulatory authority are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. such measures are likely to lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important companies in particular. such measures could include taxation of financial transactions and restrictions on employee compensation. the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ) was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. the dodd-frank act may affect our operations and governance in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in particular, the dodd-frank act vests a newly created financial services oversight council with the power to designate systemically important institutions, which will be subject to special regulatory supervision and other provisions intended to prevent, or mitigate the impact of, future disruptions in the u.s. financial system. systemically important institutions are limited to nonbank financial companies that are so important that their potential failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states. if we are designated as a systemically important institution, we could be subject to higher capital requirements and additional regulatory oversight imposed by the federal reserve, as well as to post-event assessments imposed by the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) to recoup the costs associated with the orderly resolution of other systemically important institutions in the event one or more such institutions fails. further, the fdic is authorized to petition a state court to commence an insolvency proceeding to liquidate an insurance company that fails in the event the insurer state regulator fails to act. other provisions will require central clearing of, and/or impose new margin and capital requirements on, derivatives transactions, which we expect will increase the costs of our hedging program. a number of provisions of the dodd-frank act affect us solely due to our status as a savings loan holding company. for example, under the dodd-frank act, the ots will be dissolved. the federal reserve will regulate us as a holding company, and the occ will regulate our thrift subsidiary, federal trust bank. because of our status as a savings and loan holding company or if we are designated a systemically important institution, the dodd-frank act may also restrict us from sponsoring and investing in private equity and hedge funds, which would limit our discretion in managing our general account. the dodd-frank act will also impose new minimum capital standards on a consolidated basis for holding companies that, like us, control insured depository institutions. other provisions in the dodd-frank act that may impact us, irrespective of whether or not we are a savings and loan holding company include: the possibility that regulators could break up firms that are considered too big to fail; a new federal insurance office within treasury to, among other things, conduct a study of how to improve insurance regulation in the united states; new means for regulators to limit the activities of financial firms; discretionary authority for the sec to impose a harmonized standard of care for investment advisers and broker-dealers who provide personalized advice about securities to retail customers; additional regulation of compensation in the financial services industry; and enhancements to corporate governance, especially regarding risk management. the changes resulting from the dodd-frank act could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. 20 table of contents we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments involving claim litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or significant changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable law could have a similar effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves, and how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our products appropriately. our results, financial condition and liquidity could also be adversely affected if judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from current expectations. potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we are subject to extensive u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and can affect our strategy, as well as the demand for and profitability of the products we offer. there is also a risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; requiring insurers to dividend to policy holders any excess profits; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. state insurance regulators and the naic regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. for example, the obama administration has proposed a financial crisis responsibility tax that would be levied on the largest financial institutions in terms of assets. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 21 table of contents we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. we distribute our annuity, life and property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through or in connection with individual third-party arrangements. for example, we market our consumer markets products in part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 2020. our ability to distribute products through affinity partners may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. moreover, we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity at the time it becomes known. our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations. the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. these obligations include payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends on our capital stock. the connecticut insurance holding company laws limit the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers. in addition, these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment by those subsidiaries of any dividend if the dividend and other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of: 10% of the insurer policyholder surplus as of december 31 of the preceding year, and net income, or net gain from operations if the subsidiary is a life insurance company, for the previous calendar year, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. in addition, if any dividend of a connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, or deemed commercially domiciled, generally contain similar, and in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. our property-casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.5 billion in dividends to us in 2011 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. the company life insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $83 in dividends to hartford life, inc. ( hli ) in 2011 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. the aggregate of these amounts, net of amounts required by hli, is the maximum the insurance subsidiaries could pay to hfsg holding company in 2011. in 2010, hfsg holding company and hli received no dividends from the life insurance subsidiaries, and hfsg holding company received $1.0 billion in dividends from its property-casualty insurance subsidiaries. our rights to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries, for example, upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the ability of holders of our common stock to benefit indirectly from a distribution, are subject to the prior claims of creditors of the applicable subsidiary, except to the extent that we may be a creditor of that subsidiary. claims on these subsidiaries by persons other than us include, as of december, 2010, claims by policyholders for benefits payable amounting to $116.9 billion, claims by separate account holders of $159.7 billion, and other liabilities including claims of trade creditors, claims from guaranty associations and claims from holders of debt obligations, amounting to $13.9 billion. in addition, as a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the ots, including with respect to required capital, cash flow, organization structure, risk management and earnings at the parent company level. we will be subject to similar, potentially stricter, requirements when regulatory authority over us transfers to the federal reserve (for our holding company) and the occ (for ftb). 22 table of contents holders of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. as of december 31, 2010, there were 575,000 shares of our series f preferred stock issued and outstanding. under the terms of the series f preferred stock, our ability to declare and pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock will be subject to restrictions in the event we fail to declare and pay (or set aside for payment) full dividends on the series f preferred stock. the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to an unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in a number of product lines and states, we continue to experience premium rate reductions. in these product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. even in a period of rate increases, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or other unanticipated events, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain affiliated third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios and hedging programs. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. our systems could also be subject to physical and electronic break-ins, and subject to similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. this may impede or interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 23 table of contents our framework for managing business risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us that could adversely affect our businesses. our business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and other activities, many of which are very complex and for some of which we rely on third parties. we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of these activities through a risk control framework encompassing a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. we cannot be completely confident that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks, or that our employees and third-party agents will effectively implement them. management of business risks can fail for a number of reasons, including design failure, systems failure, failures to perform or unlawful activities on the part of employees or third parties. in the event that our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations. if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised. we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties and expect to do so selectively in the future. if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy, third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, inability to meet obligations, including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. potential changes in federal or state tax laws, including changes impacting the availability of the separate account dividend received deduction, could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results or financial condition or liquidity. many of the products that the company sells benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company sells life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries. we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. other products that the company sells also enjoy similar, as well as other, types of tax advantages. the company also benefits from certain tax items, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. due in large part to the recent financial crisis that has affected many governments, there is an increasing risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and/or their policyholders. although the specific form of any such potential legislation is uncertain, it could include lessening or eliminating some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company or its policyholders including, but not limited to, those mentioned above. this could occur in the context of deficit reduction or other tax reforms. the effects of any such changes could result in materially lower product sales, lapses of policies currently held, and/or our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes. changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. u.s. gaap and related financial reporting requirements are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by the relevant authoritative bodies. such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. changes in u.s. gaap and financial reporting requirements, or in the interpretation of u.s. gaap or those requirements, could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. moreover, the sec is currently evaluating international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ) to determine whether ifrs should be incorporated into the financial reporting system for u.s. issuers. certain of these standards could result in material changes to our reported results of operation. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 24 table of contents quantitative

(together with its subsidiaries, the hartford , the company , we , or our ) is an insurance and financial services company. the hartford, headquartered in connecticut, is among the largest providers of investment products and life, property, and casualty insurance to both individual and business customers in the united states of america. also, the hartford continues to administer business previously sold in japan and the united kingdom. hartford fire insurance company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of the hartford subsidiaries. at december 31, 2011, total assets and total stockholders equity of the hartford were $304.1 billion and $22.9 billion, respectively. organization the hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry. the company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels to consumers and businesses. the company is continuously seeking to develop and expand its distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies of scale and improved technology, and capitalizes on its brand name and the hartford stag logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry. the company is currently focused on a customer-oriented strategy and organized around four divisions: commercial markets, consumer markets, wealth management and runoff operations. in the last two years, the company announced the sales of certain businesses that are not core to its focus and strategy. the company continues to evaluate its strategy and business portfolio with the goal of delivering shareholder value. as this review is ongoing and no decisions have yet been made, the following discussions of the company business and any forward-looking statements contained herein assume a continuation of the company current business focus and, as such, are subject to change based on any actions taken as a result of the company ongoing review. as a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, the hartford financial services group, inc. has no significant business operations of its own. therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations. additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the hartford financial services group, inc. may be found in the capital resources and liquidity section of part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md a ). the company maintains a retail mutual fund operation whereby the company, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to the hartford mutual funds, inc. and the hartford mutual funds ii, inc. (collectively, mutual funds ), consisting of 57 non-proprietary mutual funds, as of december 31, 2011. the company charges fees to these mutual funds, which are recorded as revenue by the company. these mutual funds are registered with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) under the investment company act of 1940. the mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the company. in the fourth quarter of 2011, the company entered into a preferred partnership agreement with wellington management company, llp ( wellington management ) and announced that wellington management will serve as the sole sub-advisor for the hartford mutual funds, including equity and fixed income funds, pending a fund-by-fund review by the hartford mutual funds board of directors. as of december 31, 2011, wellington management served as the sub-advisor for 29 of the hartford non-proprietary mutual funds and has been the primary manager for the company equity funds. reporting segments the hartford is organized into four divisions: commercial markets, consumer markets, wealth management and runoff operations. in 2011, the runoff operations division was formed to reflect the manner in which the company is currently organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. as a result, the company conducts business principally in nine reporting segments, and segment data for prior reporting periods has been adjusted accordingly. the hartford includes in its corporate category the company debt financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities; banking operations; certain fee income and commission expenses associated with sales of non-proprietary products by broker-dealer subsidiaries; and certain purchase accounting adjustments and other charges not allocated to the reporting segments. the following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of commercial markets, consumer markets and wealth management. for further discussion on the reporting segments, including financial disclosures on revenues by product, net income (loss), and assets for each reporting segment, see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 5 table of contents commercial markets the commercial markets division is organized into two reporting segments; property casualty commercial and group benefits. principal products and services property casualty commercial provides workers compensation, property, automobile, liability and umbrella coverages under several different products, primarily throughout the united states, within its standard commercial lines, which consists of the hartford small commercial and middle market lines of business. additionally, a variety of customized insurance products and risk management services including workers compensation, automobile, general liability, professional liability, fidelity, surety, livestock and specialty casualty coverages are offered to large companies through the segment specialty lines. standard commercial lines seeks to offer products with more coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder individualized risk characteristics. for small businesses, those businesses whose annual payroll is under $5 and whose revenue and property values are less than $15 each, coverages are bundled as part of a single multi-peril package policy marketed under the spectrum name. medium-sized businesses, companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed the small business definition, are served within middle market. the middle market line of business provides workers compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages. the sale of spectrum business owners package policies and workers compensation policies accounts for the majority of the written premium in the standard commercial lines. within the specialty lines, a significant portion of the specialty casualty business, including workers compensation business, is written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides collateral to support loss payments made within their deductible. the specialty casualty business also provides retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. captive and specialty programs provide insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups. group benefits provides group life, accident and disability coverage, group retiree health and voluntary benefits to individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions. group benefits offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. policies sold in this segment are generally term insurance, allowing group benefits to adjust the rates or terms of its policies in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, declining interest rates, and other factors. policies are typically sold with one, two or three-year rate guarantees depending upon the product. in addition to the products and services traditionally offered within each of its lines of business, commercial markets offers the hartford productivity advantage ( thpa ), a single-company solution for leave management, integrating the insurer short- and long-term group disability and workers compensation insurance with its leave management administration services. marketing and distribution standard commercial lines provide insurance products and services through the company home office located in hartford, connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. the products are marketed nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. the current pace of consolidation within the independent agent and broker distribution channel will likely continue such that, in the future a larger proportion of written premium will likely be concentrated among fewer agents and brokers. additionally the company offers insurance products to customers of payroll service providers through its relationships with major national payroll companies. specialty lines also provide insurance products and services through its home office located in hartford, connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. specialty lines markets its products nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent retail agents, brokers and wholesalers. the group benefits distribution network includes an experienced group of company employees, managed through a regional sales office system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution outlets including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. the company is engaged in a nationwide joint sales initiative across standard commercial lines, specialty lines and group benefits, facilitating the marketing of both integrated and traditional products and services across commercial markets. 6 table of contents competition in the small commercial marketplace, the hartford competes against a number of large national carriers, as well as regional competitors in certain territories. competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. the small commercial market has become increasingly competitive as favorable loss costs in the past few years have led carriers to differentiate themselves through product expansion, price reduction, enhanced service and cutting-edge technology. larger carriers such as the hartford have improved their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business with agents through the use of predictive modeling tools and automation which speeds up the process of evaluating a risk and quoting new business. written premium growth rates in the small commercial market have begun to rebound, while underwriting margins have been pressured by increases in loss costs, particularly in workers compensation, and higher catastrophes. a number of companies have sought to grow their business by increasing their underwriting appetite, appointing new agents and expanding business with existing agents. also, carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more aggressively competing for small commercial accounts as small commercial business has generally been less price-sensitive. middle market business is characterized as high touch and involves case-by-case underwriting and pricing decisions. compared to small commercial lines, the pricing of middle market accounts is prone to more significant variation or cyclicality over time, with more sensitivity to legislative and macro-economic forces. the economic downturn which began in 2008 has driven a reduction in average premium size as shrinking company payrolls, smaller auto fleets, and fewer business locations depress insurance exposures. additionally, various state legislative reforms in recent years designed to control workers compensation indemnity costs have led to rate reductions in many states. these factors, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have resulted in more new business opportunities in the marketplace as customers shop their policies for a better price. in the face of this competitive environment, the hartford continues to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. to gain a competitive advantage in this environment, carriers are improving automation with agents and brokers, increasing pricing sophistication, and enhancing their product offerings. these enhancements include industry specialization, with the hartford and other national carriers tailoring products and services to specific industry verticals such as technology, health care and renewable energy. specialty lines is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that operate independently within their specific industries. these businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have different business models and operating cycles. specialty lines competes on an account- by-account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction. competition in this market includes other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the hartford provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. disciplined underwriting and targeted returns are the objectives of specialty lines since premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment view of perceived market opportunity. for specialty casualty businesses, written pricing competition continues to be significant, particularly for the larger individual accounts. carriers are protecting their in-force casualty business by initiating the renewal process well in advance of the policy renewal date, effectively preventing other carriers from quoting on the business and resulting in fewer new business opportunities within the marketplace. within the national account business, as the market firms, more insureds may opt for loss-sensitive products in lieu of guaranteed cost policies. carriers writing professional liability business are increasingly focused on profitable private, middle market companies. this trend has continued as the downturn in the economy has led to a significant drop in the number of initial public offerings, and volatility for all public companies. also, carriers new business opportunities in the marketplace for directors officers and errors omissions insurance have been significantly influenced by customer perceptions of financial strength, as investment portfolio losses have had a negative effect on the financial strength ratings of some insurers. in the surety business, favorable underwriting results over the past couple of years have led to increased competition for market share, setting the stage for potential written price declines and less favorable terms and conditions. driven by the upheaval in the credit markets, new private construction activity has declined dramatically, resulting in lower demand for contract surety business. group benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. this line of business focuses on both its risk management expertise and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. competitive factors affecting group benefits include the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for coverage and services, the company relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of customer service. in addition, active price competition continues in the marketplace resulting in longer rate guarantee periods being offered to customers. top tier carriers in the marketplace also offer on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. the relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the group benefits business provides opportunities not available to smaller companies. in the commercial marketplace, the weak economy has prompted carriers to offer differentiated products and services as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. in addition to the initiatives specific to each of the hartford commercial markets lines of business noted above, the company is leveraging its diverse product, service and distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated value in the market, while simultaneously increasing its ability to access to its own diverse customer base. 7 table of contents consumer markets the consumer markets division constitutes the reporting segment. principal products and services consumer markets provides standard automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages to individuals across the united states, including a special program designed exclusively for members of aarp ( aarp program ). the hartford auto and homeowners products provide coverage options and customized pricing tailored to a customer individual risk. the hartford has individual customer relationships with aarp program policyholders and as a group these customers represent a significant portion of the total consumer markets business. business sold to aarp members, either direct or through independent agents, amounted to earned premiums of $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. consumer markets also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through the aarp health program, which is in place through 2018. marketing and distribution consumer markets reaches diverse customers through multiple distribution channels including direct sales to the consumer, brokers and independent agents. in direct sales to the consumer, the company markets its products through a mix of media, including direct mail and ecommerce marketing, television and advertising, both digitally and in publications. most of consumer markets direct sales to the consumer are associated with its exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp, which continues until january 1, 2020, to market automobile, homeowners and home-based business insurance products to aarp nearly 37 million members. this agreement provides consumer markets with an important competitive advantage given the number of baby boomers over age 50, many of whom become aarp members during this period. consumer markets is focused on targeting specific customer groups and writing business through partnerships and affinities other than aarp. during 2011, the company entered into affinity agreements with the american kennel club, sierra club and the national wildlife federation. in addition to selling product through its relationship with aarp and other affinities, beginning in 2012, the company will market direct to the consumer within select underwriting markets, acquired through partnerships or list acquisitions, and to consumers in geographies where it is especially competitive. the agency channel provides customized products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market. these independent agents are not employees of the hartford. an important strategic objective of the company is to develop common products and processes for all of its personal lines business regardless of the distribution channel. during 2011, the company substantially completed the rollout of its open road advantage product and, as of december 31, 2011, this product was available in 44 states across the company distribution channels, including direct and through independent agents. in addition, as of december 31, 2011, the hartford home advantage product was available in 38 states across similar distribution channels as the open road advantage product. competition the personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that compete on the basis of price, product, service (including claims handling), stability of the insurer and brand recognition. companies with recognized brands, direct sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. in recent years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and retain profitable business. this has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the consumer. industry sales of personal lines insurance direct to the consumer have been growing faster than sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance. carriers that distribute products mainly through agents compete by offering agents commissions and additional incentives to attract new business. to distinguish themselves in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering on-line and self service capabilities to agents and consumers. more agents have been using comparative rater tools that allow the agent to compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. the use of comparative rater tools has further increased price competition. carriers with more efficient cost structures will have an advantage in competing for new business through price. the use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to target the most profitable business and carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments. some companies, including the hartford, have written a greater percentage of their new business in preferred market segments which tend to have better loss experience but also lower average premiums. in addition, a number of companies have invested in telematics the use of devices in insured vehicles to transmit information about driving behavior such as miles driven, speed, acceleration, deceleration and are using that information to price the risk. companies that are the first to introduce telematics may enjoy a competitive advantage through favorable risk selection. 8 table of contents wealth management the wealth management division consists of the following reporting segments: individual annuity, individual life, retirement plans and mutual funds. wealth management provides investment products for over 7 million customers and life insurance for approximately 711,000 customers. in the fourth quarter of 2011, the company announced that wellington management company, llp ( wellington management ) will serve as the sole sub-advisor for the hartford non-proprietary mutual funds, including equity and fixed income funds, pending a fund-by-fund review by the hartford mutual funds board of directors. as of december 31, 2011, wellington management served as the sub-advisor for 29 of the hartford non-proprietary mutual funds and has been the primary manager for the company equity funds. as part of the company strategic decision to focus on its u.s. businesses, the company suspended all new sales in its japan and european operations in the second quarter of 2009 and divested its brazil joint venture, canadian mutual fund business and its offshore insurance business in 2010. runoff businesses, including international annuity, institutional annuity and the private placement life insurance business, previously reported as part of wealth management are now included in the life other operations segment of the runoff operations division formed in 2011. principal products and services individual annuity offers individual variable, fixed market value adjusted ( fixed mva ), fixed index and single premium immediate annuities in the u.s. individual life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life, universal life, and term life. retirement plans provides products and services to corporations, municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations pursuant to sections 401(k), 457 and 403(b) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ), respectively. mutual funds offers retail mutual funds, investment-only mutual funds and college savings plans under section 529 of the code (collectively referred to as non-proprietary) and proprietary mutual funds. marketing and distribution individual annuity distribution network includes national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and independent financial advisors. the company periodically negotiates provisions and terms of its relationships with unaffiliated parties. the company primary wholesaler of its individual annuities is hartford life distributors, llc, and its affiliate, planco, llc (collectively hld ) which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of hartford life, inc. hld provides sales support to registered representatives, financial planners and broker-dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the united states. individual life distribution network includes national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks, independent agents, independent life and property-casualty agents, and woodbury financial services, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary retail broker-dealer. retirement plans distribution network includes company employees with extensive retirement experience selling its products and services through national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and other financial institutions. mutual fund sales professionals are segmented into two teams; a retail team and an institutional team. the retail team distributes the hartford open-end funds and markets 529 college savings plans to national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions, independent financial advisors and registered investment advisors. the institutional team distributes the hartford funds to professional buyers, such as broker-dealers, consultants, record keepers, and bank trust groups. competition individual annuity competes with other life insurance companies, as well as certain banks, securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors, asset managers, and other financial intermediaries marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. product sales are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and credited rates, reputation and customer service. individual annuity annuity deposits continue to decline due to competitive activity and the company product and risk decisions. many competitors have responded to the equity market volatility by increasing the price of their living benefit products and changing the level of the guarantee offered. management believes that the most significant industry de-risking changes have occurred. in 2011, the company continued to enhance its variable annuity product designed to meet customers future income needs while abiding by the risk tolerances of the company. individual life competes with other life insurance companies in the united states, as well as other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. product sales are affected primarily by the availability and price of reinsurance, volatility in the equity markets, breadth and quality of life insurance products being offered, pricing, relationships with third-party distributors, effectiveness of wholesaling support, and the quality of underwriting and customer service. the individual life industry continues to see a distribution shift away from the traditional life insurance sales agents to the consultative financial advisor as the place people go to buy their life insurance. individual life regional sales office system is a differentiator in the market and allows it to compete effectively across multiple distribution outlets. 9 table of contents retirement plans compete with other insurance carriers, large investment brokerage companies and large mutual fund companies. the 401(k), 457, and 403(b) products offer mutual funds wrapped in variable annuities, variable funding agreements, or mutual fund retirement products. plan sponsors seek a diversity of available funds and favorable fund performance. consolidation among industry providers has continued as competitors increase scale advantages. mutual funds compete with other mutual fund companies along with investment brokerage companies and differentiate themselves through product solutions, performance, and service. in this non-proprietary broker sold market, the company and its competitors compete aggressively for net sales. reserves the hartford establishes and carries as liabilities reserves for its insurance products to estimate for the following: a liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, as well as estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims; a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the life insurance policyholder as of the consolidated financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value; a liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; fair value reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and death and living benefit reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. further discussion of the hartford property and casualty insurance product reserves, including asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in part ii, item 7, md a critical accounting estimates property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance. additional discussion may be found in the company accounting policies for insurance product reserves within note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. reinsurance the hartford cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers for both its property and casualty and life insurance products. such arrangements do not relieve the hartford of its primary liability to policyholders. failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the hartford. for property and casualty insurance products, reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater diversification of business and limit the hartford maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. a major portion of the hartford property and casualty insurance product reinsurance is effected under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. the hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses over stipulated amounts. for life insurance products, the hartford is involved in both the cession and assumption of insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. as of december 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any one of its operations was $10. for the years ended december 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company did not make any significant changes in the terms under which reinsurance is ceded to other insurers. in addition, the company has reinsured a portion of the risk associated with u.s. variable annuities and the associated guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ) riders, hartford life insurance k.k. ( hlikk ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, variable annuity contract and rider benefits, and hartford life limited ireland ( hll ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, gmdb and gmwb annuity contract and rider benefits. for further discussion on reinsurance, see part ii, item 7, md a enterprise risk management. additional discussion may be found in the company accounting policies for reinsurance within note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. investment operations the majority of the company investment portfolios are managed by hartford investment management company ( himco ). himco manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the company various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. the risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio limits for below investment grade holdings and foreign currency exposure limits. the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the company results of operations from changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. for further discussion of himco portfolio management approach, see part ii, item 7, md a enterprise risk management credit risk. in addition to managing the general account assets of the company, himco is also a sec registered investment adviser for third party institutional clients, a sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital markets transactions. himco specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active portfolio management within a disciplined risk framework that seeks to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of himco total assets under management was approximately $165.0 billion and $159.7 billion, respectively, of which $7.1 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively, were held in himco managed third party accounts. 10 table of contents enterprise risk management the company has an enterprise risk management function ( erm ) that is charged with providing analysis of the company risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the company risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances. erm plays an integral role at the hartford by fostering a strong risk management culture and discipline. the mission of erm is to support the company in achieving its strategic priorities by: providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the company, including risk concentrations and correlations; helping management define the company overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk return profile of the business relative to the company strategic intent and financial underpinning; assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the company overall risk philosophy; communicating and monitoring the firm risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and providing valuable insight to assist leaders in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines. enterprise risk management structure and governance at the hartford, the board of directors ( the board ) has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight. it exercises its oversight function through its standing committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. in addition, the finance, investment and risk management committee ( firmco ), which is comprised of all members of the board, has responsibility for oversight of all financial risk exposures facing the company, and all risks that do not fall within the oversight responsibility of any other standing committee. the audit committee is responsible for discussing with management risk assessment policies and overseeing enterprise operational risk. at the corporate level, the company enterprise chief risk officer ( ecro or chief risk officer ) leads erm. the chief risk officer reports directly to the company chief executive officer ( ceo ). reporting to the ecro are the chief insurance risk officer ( ciro ), chief operational risk officer ( coro ), and the chief market risk officer ( cmro ). the company has established the enterprise risk and capital committee ( ercc ) that includes the company ceo, chief financial officer ( cfo ), chief investment officer ( cio ), chief risk officer, the divisional presidents and the general counsel. the ercc is responsible for managing the company risks and overseeing the enterprise risk management program. the ercc reports to the board primarily through firmco and through interactions with the audit committee. the company also has committees that manage specific risks and recommend risk mitigation strategies to the ercc. these committees include, the company and division asset liability committees, catastrophe risk committee, emerging risk committees, and operational risk committee ( orc ). risk management framework at the company, risk is managed at multiple levels. the first line of risk management is generally the responsibility of the lines of business. senior business leaders are responsible for taking and managing risks specific to their business objectives and business environment. in many cases, the second line of risk management is the principal responsibility of erm. erm has the responsibility to ensure the company has insight into its aggregate risk and that risks are managed within the company overall risk tolerance. internal audit forms the third line of risk management by helping assess and ensure that risk controls are present and effective. the company risk management framework consists of four core elements: 1. risk culture and governance: the company has established policies for its major risks and a formal governance structure with leadership oversight and an assignment of accountability and authority. the governance structure starts at the board and cascades to a central executive risk management committee and then to individual risk committees across the company. in addition, the company promotes a strong risk management culture and high expectations around ethical behavior. 2. risk identification and assessment: through its erm organization, the company has developed processes for the identification, assessment, and, when appropriate, response to internal and external risks to the company operations and business objectives. risk identification and prioritization has been established within each area, including processes around emerging risks. 3. risk appetite and limits: the company has a formal risk appetite statement that is approved by the company ercc and reviewed by the board. based on its risk appetite, the company has implemented stated risk tolerances and an associated limit structure for each of its major insurance and financial risks. these formal limits are encapsulated in formal risk policies that are reviewed at least annually by the ercc. 4. risk monitoring, controls and communication: the company monitors its major risks at the enterprise level through a number of enterprise reports, including but not limited to, a monthly risk dashboard, tracking the return on risk-capital across products, and regular stress testing. erm communicates the company risk exposures to senior and executive management and the board, and reviews key business performance metrics, risk indicators, audit reports, risk/control self assessments and risk event data. 11 table of contents risk exposures and quantification the company quantifies its enterprise insurance and financial risk exposures using multiple lenses including statutory, economic and, where appropriate, u.s. gaap. erm leverages various modeling techniques and metrics to provide a view of the company risk exposure in both normal and stressed environments. erm regularly monitors the company risk exposure as compared to defined statutory limits and provides regular reporting to the ercc. in order to quantify group capital levels, risk correlations and concentrations, and the potential benefits of risk diversification at an enterprise level, the company performs stress testing and scenario analysis. the company uses its economic capital model ( ecm ) to quantify the value of risk management across the business lines and to advance its risk-based decision-making and optimization across risk and business. the company also uses the ecm to inform the attribution of risk capital to each line of business. erm supports the attribution of risk capital by line of business and the analysis of returns on risk capital in conjunction with the chief financial officer. the company categorizes its main risks as follows in order to achieve a consistent and disciplined approach to quantifying, evaluating, and managing risk: insurance risk operational risk financial risk business risk insurance risk the company defines insurance risk as its exposure to loss due to property, liability, mortality, morbidity, disability, longevity and other perils and risks covered under its policies, including adverse development on loss reserves supporting its products and geographic accumulations of loss over time due to property or casualty catastrophes. operational risk the company defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. financial risk financial risk is broadly defined by the company to include liquidity, interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, and credit risks, all of which have the potential to materially impact the company financial condition. financial risk also includes exposure to events that may cause correlated movement in the above risk factors. business risk the company manages its business risk at all levels of the organization. the company categorizes its business risk as strategic risk and management risk. strategic risk is defined as the risk to the defined company objectives from adverse developments in the company strategy vis- -vis changing market conditions and competitor actions. management risk is defined as the risk to defined company objectives from the ineffective or inefficient execution of the company strategic and business decisions. enterprise strategic and management risks are assessed through strategic, business and operating plan reviews, as well as through management self-assessment processes and benchmarking. for further discussion on risk management, see part ii, item 7, md a enterprise risk management. regulation insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states. the extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments. such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported. most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the hartford. this legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. all transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department prior approval. in the jurisdictions in which the company insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of the hartford outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory filings. 12 table of contents certain of the company life insurance subsidiaries sell variable life insurance, variable annuity, and some fixed guaranteed products that are securities registered with the sec under the securities act of 1933, as amended. some of the products have separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 act ) and/or are regulated by state law. separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation. moreover, each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund that is also registered as an investment company under the 1940 act ( underlying funds ). the company offers these underlying funds and retail mutual funds that are registered with and regulated by the sec. in addition, other subsidiaries of the company are involved in the offering, selling and distribution of the company variable insurance products, underlying funds and retail mutual funds as broker dealers and are subject to regulation promulgated and enforced by the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), the sec and/or in, some instances, state securities administrators. other entities operate as investment advisers registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 and are registered as investment advisers under certain state laws, as applicable. one subsidiary is an investment company registered under the 1940 act. because federal and state laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in securities markets, they generally grant regulators broad rulemaking and enforcement authority. some of these regulations include, among other things, regulations impacting sales methods, trading practices, suitability of investments, use and safekeeping of customers funds, corporate governance, capital, record keeping, and reporting requirements. the extent of insurance regulation on business outside the united states varies significantly among the countries in which the hartford operates. some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate insurers extensively. foreign insurers in certain countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. the hartford international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective countries. in addition, as described under legislative developments, we are subject to a number of dodd-frank act provisions. failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees. we cannot predict the impact of these actions on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. intellectual property we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. we have a worldwide trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the hartford name, the stag logo and the combination of these two marks. the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration requirements. we regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. employees the hartford has approximately 24,400 employees as of december 31, 2011. available information the hartford makes available, free of charge, on or through its internet website (http://www.thehartford.com) the hartford annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after the hartford electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the sec. none of the information made available on the hartford internet website shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference herein. information filed or furnished to the sec may be read and copied at the sec public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549 or by calling the sec at 1-800-sec-0330. in addition, the sec maintains an internet website (http://sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec. 13 table of contents item 1a. risk factors investing in the hartford involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the hartford and could also cause the trading price of our securities, including our common stock and other equity-related securities, to experience significant fluctuations and volatility. the hartford may also be subject to other general risks that are not specifically enumerated. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). the following risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance. our operating environment remains subject to uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery. the steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate to mitigate the financial, competitive and other risks associated with our operating environment, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. the decline of certain global economies, including europe, and the possible contagion effect, cast uncertainty regarding the timing and strength of an economic recovery, which negatively affected our operating environment in 2011. continued high unemployment, lower family income, lower business investment and lower consumer spending in most geographic markets we serve have adversely affected the demand for financial and insurance products, as well as their profitability in some cases. our results, financial condition and statutory capital remain sensitive to equity and credit market performance and effects of interest rates and foreign currency, and we expect that market conditions will put pressure on returns in our life and property and casualty investment portfolios and that our hedging costs (in particular with respect to our variable annuities businesses) will remain higher than historical levels. if global economies continue to decline, economic conditions do not broadly improve and real estate valuations do not stabilize and over time increase, we would expect to experience additional realized and unrealized investment losses, particularly in the real estate and financial services sectors. negative rating agency actions with respect to our investments could also indirectly adversely affect our statutory capital and risk-based capital ( rbc ) ratios, which could in turn have other negative consequences for our business and results. the steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate if economic conditions do not continue to improve in line with our forecasts. these steps include ongoing initiatives, particularly the execution risk relating to the continued repositioning of our investment portfolios and the continuing refinement of our hedge programs for our variable annuity businesses. if our actions are not adequate, our ability to support the scale of our business and to absorb operating losses and liabilities under our customer contracts could be impaired, which would in turn adversely affect our overall competitiveness and the capital position of the company. even if the measures we have taken (or take in the future) are effective to mitigate the risks associated with our current operating environment, they may have unintended consequences. for example, rebalancing our hedging program to protect economic value, while being mindful of statutory surplus, may result in greater earnings volatility under generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ( u.s. gaap ). we could be required to consider actions to manage our capital position and liquidity or further reduce our exposure to market and financial risks. we may also be forced to sell assets on unfavorable terms that could cause us to incur charges or lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery. we could also face other pressures, such as employee recruitment and retention issues and potential loss of distribution for our products. additionally, if there was concern over the company capital position that creates an anticipation of the company issuing additional common stock or equity linked instruments, trading prices for our common stock could decline. 14 table of contents as a result of our ongoing evaluation of the company strategy and business portfolio, we may pursue one or more transactions or take other actions, which may include discontinuance or placing in run-off certain lines of business and/or pursuing strategic acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, any of which could subject the company to a number of challenges, uncertainties and risks or negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. as previously announced, we are evaluating our strategy and business portfolio with the goal of delivering greater shareholder value. in particular, we noted that while we recognize there are potential benefits to a separation of our p c and life companies, there are challenges to successfully executing such a separation. as a result of these or other evaluations of the company strategy and business portfolio, we may pursue one or more transactions or take other actions, which may include discontinuing or placing in run-off certain lines of business and/or pursuing strategic acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings. because these transactions involve a number of challenges, uncertainties and risks, we may not be able to consummate any such transaction or, if concluded, achieve some or all of the benefits, including in respect of shareholder value, that we expect to derive from it. pursuit of these initiatives may also, among other things, divert management attention and resources or result in a loss of employees or clients, surrenders, withdrawals, contract terminations or potential adverse capital or tax impacts. completion of certain divestitures or restructurings might require consents under the covenants of our indentures (including in respect of allocation of our indebtedness), might require actions to satisfy certain rating agency criteria and could result in our retaining insurance or reinsurance obligations or result in recognition of other contingent liabilities (including in respect of intercompany guarantees). any such transactions could also involve related financing transactions, including the issuance of equity or equity-related securities that could have a dilutive effect on our shareholders. in addition, the completion of an acquisition may require use of our capital and may involve difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. moreover, completion of an acquisition, divestiture or restructuring may require regulatory approvals or other third-party approvals (including the consents noted above), and these may not be able to be obtained or may involve significant additional cost, time, regulatory capital commitments and other regulatory conditions and obligations. any such transactions may also be subject to additional significant execution risks, costs and delays. as a result of any of the foregoing, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be negatively impacted. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, market volatility, foreign exchange rates and global real estate market deterioration that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our businesses in wealth management and runoff operations, such as u.s. and international variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. should equity markets decline from current levels, assets under management and related fee income will be reduced. such a decline would also place greater stress on the variable annuities businesses, which requires significant allocated capital due to rating agencies and regulatory requirements, including with respect to stress scenarios. furthermore, certain of our products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure should equity markets continue to decline. sustained declines in equity markets may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support these products. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. prolonged low interest rates or market returns are likely to have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans. our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates were to rise dramatically within a six-to-twelve month time period, certain of our wealth management businesses might be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. although our products have features such as surrender charges, market-value adjustments and put options on certain retirement plans, we are subject to disintermediation risk. an increase in interest rates can also impact our tax planning strategies and in particular our ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. in a declining rate environment, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our life businesses, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks, increased hedging costs, spread compression and capital volatility. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. if issuer credit spreads widen significantly or retain historically wide levels over an extended period of time, additional other-than-temporary impairments and increases in the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio will likely result. in addition, losses have also occurred due to the volatility in credit spreads. when credit spreads widen, we incur losses associated with the credit derivatives where the company assumes exposure. when credit spreads tighten, we incur losses associated with derivatives where the company has purchased credit protection. if credit spreads tighten significantly, the company net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity can make it difficult to value certain of our securities when trading becomes less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 15 table of contents our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ( mva ) annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the u.s. and japanese libor in japan. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the u.s. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the u.s. or japanese libor in japan, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this has resulted and may continue to result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product. our primary foreign currency exchange risk is related to certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan and u.k. variable annuities. the strengthening of the yen compared with other currencies will substantially increase our exposure to pay yen-denominated obligations. in addition, our foreign currency exchange risk relates to net income from foreign operations, non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, and our yen-denominated individual fixed annuity product. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated annuity products. a strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to foreign currencies will increase our exposure to the u.s. variable annuity guarantee benefits where policyholders have elected to invest in international funds, generating losses and statutory surplus strain. our real estate market exposure includes investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations, mortgage and real estate partnerships, and mortgage loans. significant deterioration in the real estate market in the recent past has adversely affected our business and results of operations. further deterioration in the real estate market, including increases in property vacancy rates, delinquencies and foreclosures, could have a negative impact on property values and sources of refinancing resulting in reduced market liquidity and higher risk premiums. this could result in impairments of real estate backed securities, a reduction in net investment income associated with real estate partnerships, and increases in our valuation allowance for mortgage loans. significant declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads, inflation, the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, or global real estate market deterioration, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated rather than diversified. our adjustment of our risk management program relating to products we offer with guaranteed benefits to emphasize protection of statutory surplus and cash flows will likely result in greater u.s. gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income in periods of rising equity market pricing levels. some of the products offered by our wealth management businesses and previously offered by our life other operations business, especially variable annuities, offer guaranteed benefits which, in the event of a decline in equity markets, would not only result in lower earnings, but will also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we are also subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, including the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ( gmab ), guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) offered with variable annuity products. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. however, due to the severe economic conditions starting in the fourth quarter of 2008, we have adjusted our risk management program to place greater relative emphasis on the protection of statutory surplus and cash flows. this shift in relative emphasis has resulted in greater u.s. gaap earnings volatility and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, lower interest rates, rises in volatility and weakening of the yen against other currencies. while we believe that these actions have improved the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. we are also subject to the risk that these management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 16 table of contents the amount of statutory capital that we have, and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements, can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market, interest rate and foreign currency conditions, changes in policyholder behavior and changes in rating agency models. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on rbc formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdiction in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of internal reinsurance arrangements, and changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company control. the company financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios will generally increase. this may be offset, however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and rbc requirements could also increase, lowering rbc ratios. for example, while our property and casualty companies are expected to generate statutory surplus in 2012, our life companies statutory surplus is expected to be flat to negative in 2012, as compared to 2011, primarily due to high variable annuity hedge losses compared to fees earned and a depression on statutory earnings in other life businesses due largely to continued low interest rates and high loss cost trends in group benefits. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, could increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, at their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products. our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 17 table of contents our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, and separate account assets. the determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment in determining their fair values and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether a credit and/or non-credit impairment exists and whether an impairment should be recognized in current period earnings or in other comprehensive income. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company currently uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost; changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer; whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments; changes in the financial condition of the security underlying collateral; the payment structure of the security; the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, commercial and residential property value declines that vary by property type and location and average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year; other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies; our intent to sell a debt or an equity security with debt-like characteristics (collectively, debt security ) or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery; and our intent and ability to retain an equity security without debt-like characteristics for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value. impairment losses in earnings could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. 18 table of contents losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities (which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities, european private and sovereign issuers, or other high yielding bonds) mortgage loans or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities or loans may deteriorate causing these securities or loans to incur losses. our investment portfolio includes securities backed by real estate assets the value of which have been adversely impacted by the recent recessionary period, high unemployment rates and the associated property value declines, ultimately resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows for certain securities. the company also has exposure to european based issuers of securities and providers of reinsurance, as well as indirect european exposure resulting from the variable annuity products that it has sold in japan and the united kingdom. further details of the european private and sovereign issuers held within the investment portfolio and indirect variable annuity exposures can be found in part ii, item 7, md a enterprise risk management investment portfolio risks and risk management. the company european based reinsurance arrangements are further described in part ii, item 7, md a enterprise risk management investment portfolio risks and risk management european exposure. further property value declines and loss rates that exceed our current estimates, as outlined in part ii, item 7, md a enterprise risk management other-than-temporary impairments, a worsening of general economic conditions, including the european financial crisis, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. to the extent the investment portfolio is not adequately diversified, concentrations of credit risk may exist which could negatively impact the company if significant adverse events or developments occur in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic regions. the company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company stockholders equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government. however, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, the company credit concentration risk could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company defers acquisition costs associated with the sales of its universal and variable life and variable annuity products. these costs are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the company evaluates the egps compared to the dac asset to determine if an impairment exists. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and gmib using components of egps. the projection of estimated gross profits or components of estimated gross profits requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns in excess of amounts credited to policyholders, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin (including impairments), mortality, benefit utilization, annuitization and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques, could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including lapse rates, benefit utilization, surrenders, and annuitization, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb and gmib which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the company to limit risk. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 19 table of contents deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains, to offset previously recognized capital losses, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on realized capital losses, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income. charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. as previously announced, we are evaluating our strategy and business portfolios with the goal of delivering greater shareholder value. certain strategic transactions may adversely affect our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 is also limited. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our results during the period or periods affected and, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks or other geopolitical or military crises, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 20 table of contents it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. for some asbestos and environmental claims, we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these longer-tailed exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related periods. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now, but could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes, both natural and man-made, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, tornadoes, explosions, pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, tornadoes in the midwest and southeast, and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. starting in 2004 and 2005, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events have incorporated medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity reflecting the potential influence of multi-decadal climate patterns within the atlantic. in addition, changing climate conditions across longer time scales, including the potential risk of broader climate change, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the severity of certain natural catastrophe losses across various geographic regions. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. potential examples of the impact of climate change on catastrophe exposure include, but are not limited to the following: an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere, more frequent brush fires in certain geographies due to prolonged periods of drought, higher incidence of deluge flooding, and the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. our operations are also exposed to risk of loss from catastrophes associated with pandemics and other events that could significantly increase our mortality and morbidity exposures. policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment products. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. to the extent that loss experience unfolds or models improve, we will seek to reflect any increased risk in the design and pricing of our products. however, the company may be exposed to regulatory or legislative actions that prevent a full accounting of loss expectations in the design or pricing of our products or result in additional risk-shifting to the insurance industry. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes, or other events that can cause unfavorable results of operations, through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. historically, reinsurance pricing has changed significantly from time to time. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. 21 table of contents competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. these competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents and for our employees. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may experience difficulty in marketing, distributing and providing investment advisory services in relation to our products through current and future distribution channels and advisory firms. we distribute our annuity, life, property and casualty insurance products and mutual funds through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through or in connection with individual third-party arrangements. for example, we market our consumer markets products in part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 2020. our ability to distribute products through affinity partners may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. in addition, we work with a number of key investment advisers in managing our products and mutual funds. in december 2011, for example, we entered into a 5-year agreement with wellington management company as the preferred sub-advisor for the hartford mutual funds. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties, including potentially as a result of a strategic transaction, could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the impact of regulatory initiatives, including the enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ), could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. regulatory developments relating to the recent financial crisis may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. u.s. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities, including the sec, the federal reserve, the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ), the new york stock exchange and the financial industry regulatory authority are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. such measures are likely to lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important companies in particular. such measures could include taxation of financial transactions and restrictions on employee compensation. the dodd-frank act was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. the dodd-frank act may affect our operations and governance in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. certain provisions of the dodd-frank act will require central clearing of, and/or impose new margin and capital requirements on, derivatives transactions, which we expect will increase the costs of our hedging program. other provisions in the dodd-frank act that may impact us include: a new federal insurance office within treasury; discretionary authority for the sec to impose a harmonized standard of care for investment advisers and broker-dealers who provide personalized advice about securities to retail customers; possible adverse impact on the pricing and liquidity of the securities in which we invest resulting from the proprietary trading and market making limitation of the volcker rule; possible prohibition of certain asset-backed securities transactions that could adversely impact our ability to offer insurance-linked securities; and enhancements to corporate governance, especially regarding risk management. in particular, the dodd-frank act vests a newly created financial services oversight council ( fsoc ) with the power to designate systemically important institutions, which will be subject to special regulatory supervision and other provisions intended to prevent, or mitigate the impact of, future disruptions in the u.s. financial system. systemically important institutions are limited to large bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies that are so important that their potential failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states. the fsoc released a second notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth the process they propose to follow when designating systemically important nonbank financial companies in october 2011, but has not yet released a final rule or indicated when the fsoc will begin designating systemically important nonbank financial companies. 22 table of contents if we are designated as a systemically important institution, we could be subject to higher capital requirements and additional regulatory oversight imposed by the federal reserve, as well as to post-event assessments imposed by the fdic to recoup the costs associated with the orderly liquidation of other systemically important institutions in the event one or more such institutions fails. further, the fdic is authorized to petition a state court to commence an insolvency proceeding to liquidate an insurance company that fails in the event the insurer state regulator fails to act. we may also be restricted from sponsoring and investing in private equity and hedge funds, which would limit our discretion in managing our general account. the federal reserve issued a proposed rule in december 2011 that would apply capital and liquidity requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, and stress testing and risk management requirements to systemically important institutions, and subject such institutions to an early remediation regime based on these requirements. the federal reserve has noted that they may tailor the application of the proposed rule to the particular attributes of systemically important nonbank financial companies. if the hartford were to be designated as systemically important by the fsoc, these requirements could apply to the hartford. however, it is not yet clear how or to what extent these requirements would be applied to systemically important nonbank financial companies. we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments involving claim litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or significant changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable law could have a similar effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves, and how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our products appropriately. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could also be adversely affected if judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from current expectations. our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity at the time it becomes known. potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we are subject to extensive u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and can affect our strategy, as well as the demand for and profitability of the products we offer. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; protecting privacy; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; approving acquisitions, divestitures and similar transactions; restricting the payment of dividends to the parent company and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; requiring insurers to dividend any excess profits to policy holders; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. 23 table of contents because these laws and regulations are complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal, accounting, or reserving issue may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. for example, certain of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries use the naic model regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies, commonly known as regulation xxx, in setting statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees . in addition, actuarial guideline 38 ( ag38 or axxx ) clarifies the application of regulation xxx with respect to universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees, i.e., a guaranteed death benefit for a specified period of time, often for life. virtually all of our in force universal life insurance products are now affected by regulation xxx and axxx. the application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may not be consistent with the opinion of state insurance departments. we cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. moreover, it is possible that the reinsurance and capital management actions we have taken to mitigate the impact of regulation xxx and axxx on our universal life insurance business may face regulatory, rating agency or other challenges. furthermore, we may be unable to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impact of these regulations on future sales of term life insurance and universal life policies, resulting in lower returns on such products than we currently anticipate or reduce our sales of these products. furthermore, our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate (primarily the japan financial services agency and the united kingdom financial services authority), which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions and obligations. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. see the risk factor, the impact of regulatory initiatives, including the enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the dodd-frank act ), could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations. the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. these obligations include payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends on our capital stock. the connecticut insurance holding company laws limit the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers. in addition, these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment by those subsidiaries of any dividend which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of: 10% of the insurer policyholder surplus as of december 31 of the preceding year, or net income, or net gain from operations if the subsidiary is a life insurance company, for the previous calendar year, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. in addition, if any dividend of a connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, or deemed commercially domiciled, generally contain similar, and in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. dividends paid to us by our insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on their cash requirements. for further discussion on dividends from insurance subsidiaries, see part ii, item 7, md a capital resources liquidity. our rights to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries, for example, upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the ability of holders of our common stock to benefit indirectly from a distribution, are subject to the prior claims of creditors of the applicable subsidiary, except to the extent that we may be a creditor of that subsidiary. claims on these subsidiaries by persons other than us include, as of december, 2011, claims by policyholders for benefits payable amounting to $117.1 billion, claims by separate account holders of $143.9 billion, and other liabilities including claims of trade creditors, claims from guaranty associations and claims from holders of debt obligations, amounting to $13.0 billion. holders of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. as of december 31, 2011, there were 575,000 shares of our series f preferred stock issued and outstanding. under the terms of the series f preferred stock, our ability to declare and pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock will be subject to restrictions in the event we fail to declare and pay (or set aside for payment) full dividends on the series f preferred stock. 24 table of contents the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in all of our property and casualty insurance product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. in addition, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we use computer systems to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, conducting our financial reporting and analysis, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios and hedging programs. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a terrorist attack or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees and business partners are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed. moreover, our systems may be subject to a computer virus or other malicious code, unauthorized access, a cyber-attack or other computer related violation. such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties with whom we interact, impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. in addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to utilize such capabilities in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with regulations enacted by u.s. federal and state governments, the european union, japan or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others. a misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from an employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. 25 table of contents third parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions are also subject to the risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. our framework for managing business risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us that could adversely affect our businesses. our business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and other activities, many of which are very complex and for some of which we rely on third parties. we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of these activities through a risk control framework encompassing a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. we cannot be completely confident that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks, or that our employees and third-party agents will effectively implement them. management of business risks can fail for a number of reasons, including design failure, systems failure, failures to perform, cyber security attacks or unlawful activities on the part of employees or third parties. in the event that our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations. if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised. we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties and expect to do so selectively in the future. if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy, third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, inability to meet obligations, including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. for other risks associated with our outsourcing of certain functions, see the risk factor, if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or a cyber or other information security incident, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. potential changes in federal or state tax laws, including changes impacting the availability of the separate account dividend received deduction, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. many of the products that the company sells benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company sells life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries. we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. other products that the company sells also enjoy similar, as well as other, types of tax advantages. the company also benefits from certain tax items, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. due in large part to the recent financial crisis that has affected many governments, there is an increasing risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and/or their policyholders. for example, on february 13, 2012, the obama administration released its fy 2013, budget of the united states government that includes proposals which, if enacted, would adversely affect the company sale of variable annuities and variable life products and its profits on corporate owned life insurance policies. although the specific form of any such potential legislation is uncertain, it could include lessening or eliminating some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company or its policyholders including, but not limited to, those mentioned above. this could occur in the context of deficit reduction or other tax reforms. the effects of any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, and could result in materially lower product sales, lapses of policies currently held, and/or our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes. changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. u.s. gaap and related financial reporting requirements are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by the relevant authoritative bodies. such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. changes in u.s. gaap and financial reporting requirements, or in the interpretation of u.s. gaap or those requirements, could result in material changes to our reported results and financial condition. moreover, the sec is currently evaluating international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ) to determine whether ifrs should be incorporated into the financial reporting system for u.s. issuers. certain of these standards could result in material changes to our reported results of operation. 26 table of contents we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is set forth in the capital markets risk management section of item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors investing in the hartford involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of the hartford. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by the hartford with the securities and exchange commission. we have been materially adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally, and may be materially adversely affected if these conditions persist or deteriorate further in 2009 or if our planned initiatives are not effective. markets in the united states and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and disruption for more than 12 months, due largely to the stresses affecting the global banking system, which accelerated significantly in the second half of 2008. the united states, europe and japan have entered a severe recession that is likely to persist well into and perhaps through and even beyond 2009, despite past and expected governmental intervention in the world major economies. these circumstances have exerted significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and virtually all other asset classes and have resulted in substantially increased market volatility, severely constrained credit and capital markets, particularly for financial institutions, and an overall loss of investor confidence. economic conditions have continued to deteriorate in early 2009. like other financial institutions and particularly life insurers, which face significant financial and capital markets risk in their operations, we have been adversely affected, to a significant extent, by these conditions. among other effects, we incurred significant investment losses and other charges in 2008, notably with respect to deferred acquisition costs and goodwill associated with our variable annuity and international businesses, which resulted in a net loss for the fourth quarter and the full year. our unrealized loss position also increased substantially in 2008. the unanticipated, severe decline in the equity markets also caused material increases to our liabilities in connection with certain annuity products, a line of business in which we have significant concentration. concerns related to investment losses, liabilities arising from variable annuity products and capital pressures, which led to severe pressure on our stock price in 2008, are continuing in 2009. as detailed in the following risk factors, we expect to continue to face significant challenges and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results, financial condition and prospects. our capital position declined in 2008 relative to 2007, notwithstanding our capital-raising transaction with allianz se in october 2008. we expect continued pressure on our capital position in 2009. further significant declines in our capital position could impair our ability to support the scale of our business as currently constituted and to absorb continuing operating losses and liabilities under our customer contracts and our overall competitiveness. we have taken a number of steps to preserve capital and mitigate risk, among them launching a range of initiatives to reduce risks associated with our various lines of business, applying for federal funds under the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( eesa ) and looking across the enterprise for additional opportunities to reduce risk. these initiatives include modifying product features, adjusting our hedging activities and mitigating risks in our investment portfolio, and could also include discontinuing or restructuring certain business lines. like other companies, we are also evaluating our expense base in light of expected contractions in certain of our business lines and have further reduced our dividend rate. taken as a whole, these actions may not be effective, especially if the global economy experiences further shocks. even if effective, certain measures may have unintended consequences. for example, rebalancing our hedging program may better protect our statutory surplus, but may also result in greater u.s. gaap earnings volatility. these actions may also entail additional costs or result in further impairment or other charges or adversely affect our ability to compete successfully in an increasingly difficult consumer market. on february 6, 2009, moody investor services downgraded our long-term debt rating to baa1 and the financial strength ratings of our principal subsidiaries to a1 . on february 9, 2009, fitch ratings downgraded our long-term debt rating to bbb and the financial strength ratings of our principal subsidiaries to a (in the case of our life subsidiaries) and a (in the case of our property and casualty subsidiaries) and standard poor downgraded our counterparty credit rating to a- . if our planned initiatives fail to mitigate the impacts on the company of the current recession, or if the current recession is even more severe than expected, we may also experience further downgrades of our financial strength and credit ratings. see ratings within capital resources and liquidity of the md a. while reductions in ratings may ease pressure on our capital position, it could also have negative implications for our competitive position. we may also need to raise additional capital or consider other transactions to manage our capital position and liquidity or further reduce our exposure to market and financial risks. we may not be able to raise sufficient capital as and when required if the financial markets remain in turmoil, and any capital we raise may be on terms that are dilutive to existing shareholders or otherwise unfavorable to us. any sales of securities or other assets that we may carry out may be completed on unfavorable terms or cause us to incur charges, and we would lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery. if our business continues to experience significant challenges, we may face other pressures, such as employee retention issues and potential loss of distributors for our products. other developments relating to the current economic environment and financial crisis may also significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. for example, u.s. and overseas governmental or regulatory authorities, including the securities and exchange commission (the sec ), the office of thrift supervision ( ots ), the new york stock exchange or the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ), may implement enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. new regulations will likely affect critical matters, including capital requirements, and published proposals by insurance regulatory authorities that could reduce the pressure on our capital position may not be adopted or may be adopted in a form that does not afford as much capital relief as anticipated. if we fail to manage the impact of these developments effectively, our prospects, results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 22 table of contents the markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme and unprecedented volatility and disruption. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, and foreign exchange rates which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing and are expected to continue to experience extreme and unprecedented volatility and disruption. we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. one important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our life businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. during the course of 2008, the significant declines in equity markets have negatively impacted assets under management. as a result, fee income earned from those assets has also been negatively impacted. in addition, certain of our life products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure should equity markets decline. due to declines in equity markets during 2008, our liability for these guaranteed benefits has significantly increased and our statutory capital position has decreased. further sustained declines in equity markets during 2009 may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support these products. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns are likely to have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans. our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain of our life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our life businesses, such as structured settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. in other situations, declines in interest rates or changes in credit spreads may result in reducing the duration of certain life liabilities, creating asset liability duration mismatches and lower spread income. our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. the recent widening of credit spreads has contributed to the increase in the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio of $12.5 billion in 2008, before dac effects and tax, and has also contributed to the increase in other than temporary impairments. if issuer credit spreads continue to widen significantly over an extended period of time, it would likely exacerbate these effects, resulting in greater and additional other-than-temporary impairments. increased losses have also occurred associated with credit based non-qualifying derivatives where the company assumes credit exposure. if credit spreads tighten significantly, it will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities. in addition, a reduction in market liquidity has made it difficult to value certain of our securities as trading has become less frequent. as such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. our statutory surplus is also impacted by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ( mva ) annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the u.s. and japanese libor in japan. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the u.s. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, such as we are now experiencing, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the u.s. or japanese libor in japan, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this has resulted and may continue to result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the product. our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations, non u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, our yen-denominated individual fixed annuity product, and certain guaranteed benefits associated with the japan and u.k. variable annuities. these risks relate to potential decreases in value and income resulting from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product. in comparison, a strengthening of the japanese yen or british pound in comparison to the u.s. dollar and other currencies will increase our exposure to the guarantee benefits associated with the japan or u.k. variable annuities. correspondingly, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to other currencies will increase our exposure to the u.s. variable annuity guarantee benefits where policyholders have elected to invest in international funds. if significant, further declines in equity prices, changes in u.s. interest rates, changes in credit spreads and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, individually or in combination, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity both directly and indirectly by creating competitive and other pressures such as employee retention issues and the potential loss of distributors for our products. 23 table of contents in addition, in the conduct of our business, there could be scenarios where in order to reduce risks, fulfill our obligations or to raise incremental liquidity, we would sell assets at a loss for a variety of reasons including the unrealized loss position in our overall investment portfolio and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. these scenarios could include selling assets as the company reduces its securities lending program. declines in equity markets and changes in interest rates and credit spreads can also negatively impact the fair values of each of our segments. if a significant decline in the fair value of a segment occurred and this resulted in an excess of that segment book value over fair value, the goodwill assigned to that segment might be impaired and could cause the company to record a charge to impair a part or all of the related goodwill assets, as occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 with respect to our individual annuity and international reporting units. see impairment of goodwill risk factor for further information on this risk. we may be unable to effectively mitigate the impact of equity market volatility arising from obligations under annuity product guarantees, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. some of the products offered by our life businesses, especially variable annuities, offer certain guaranteed benefits which, as a result of any decline in equity markets would not only result in lower earnings, but may also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. during the course of 2008, as equity markets declined, our liability for guaranteed benefits significantly increased. we are also subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, especially the guaranteed minimum death benefit ( gmdb ), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ( gmwb ), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ( gmab ) and guaranteed minimum income benefit ( gmib ) offered with variable annuity products. as of december 31, 2008, the liability for gmwb and gmab was $6.6 billion and $0, respectively. the liability for gmib and gmdb was a combined $473, net of reinsurance as of december 31, 2008. we use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. however, due to the severe economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008, we have adjusted our risk management program to place greater relative emphasis on the protection of statutory surplus. this shift in relative emphasis will likely result in greater u.s. gaap earnings volatility. while we believe that these and other actions we have taken serve to improve the efficiency by which we manage the risks related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, and are subject to the risk that other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the amount of statutory capital that we have and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including equity market, credit market, interest rate and foreign currency conditions, changes in policyholder behavior and changes in rating agency models. we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ). insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital ( rbc ) formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain living benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the naic rbc formulas. most of these factors are outside of the company control. the company financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios will generally increase, however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and rbc requirements could increase resulting in lower rbc ratios. due to all of these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. during february 2009, our financial strength and credit ratings have been downgraded by multiple rating agencies. to the extent that our statutory capital resources are deemed to be insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing. alternatively, if we were not to raise additional capital in such a scenario, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be further downgraded by one or more rating agencies. 24 table of contents our application to participate in the cpp may not be approved or, if approved, may subject us to additional restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in order to supplement our capital position, we have applied to the u.s. treasury department to receive funds from its capital purchase program ( cpp ). if approved, we estimate that we may be eligible to receive between $1.1 billion and $3.4 billion in funds. there can be no assurance, however, that we will be approved to participate in the cpp or, if approved, that we will receive an amount consistent with our estimates. if other insurance companies are approved to participate in the cpp but we are not so approved, it could create negative market perceptions of our financial strength and capital position, reduce our available options to raise capital and otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. if we do receive approval to participate in the cpp, receipt of cpp funds will subject us to additional regulation and restrictions that may have a negative impact on our operations. in order to be eligible to receive cpp funds, we agreed to acquire (contingent on our approval to participate in the cpp) the parent company of federal trust bank ( ftb ), a federally chartered, fdic-insured thrift. as required by the ots as a condition to consummating that acquisition, we have since been approved by the ots to become a savings and loan holding company. as a result, if we are approved to participate in the cpp and consummate the acquisition of ftb, we will be subject to supervision and examination by the ots. new legislation or regulations may also be adopted that would impose additional constraints on the operations of recipients of cpp funds. such restrictions, combined with ots oversight, may make it more difficult to recruit and retain key employees and otherwise restrict our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. in addition, if we consummate the acquisition of ftb, we have agreed with ots to contribute approximately $100 to the capital of ftb and to serve as a source of strength to ftb, which could require the contribution of additional capital to ftb in the future. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. we have experienced and may experience additional future downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. during february 2009, our financial strength and credit ratings have been downgraded by multiple rating agencies. see our ratings in capital resources and liquidity section of the md a. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered these models. changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. the recent downgrades we have experienced, a further downgrade, or an announced potential further downgrade, in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings thereby reducing future sales of our products and lowering future earnings. the recent downgrades we have experienced, a further downgrade of our credit ratings, or an announced potential further downgrade, could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, or at all, and accordingly, would likely increase our cost of capital. the recent downgrades we have experienced, or a further downgrade of our credit ratings could also make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above. after taking into consideration rating agency actions through february 10, 2009, a downgrade of three levels below our current insurance financial strength levels could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and could also trigger counterparty rights to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. if any of these negative events were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected. 25 table of contents our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by general domestic and international economic and business conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of business we conduct. for example, in an economic downturn such as the current financial crisis characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products has been adversely affected. further, given that we offer our products and services in north america, japan, europe and south america, we are exposed to these risks in multiple geographic locations. our operations are subject to different local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges, which may affect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolio, the required levels of our capital and surplus and the credit quality of local counterparties. these risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in countries in which we operate, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks of our local counterparties, lack of local business experience in certain markets and, in certain cases, risks associated with potential incompatibility with partners. we may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, and we cannot guarantee that the inability to successfully address the risks related to economic conditions in all of the geographic locations where we conduct business will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the company consolidated financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives, and separate account assets. the company has categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). in many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability position may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in these situations, the company will determine the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. the determination of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption such as we are currently experiencing, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it has been and will likely continue to be difficult to value certain of our securities, such as alt-a, subprime mortgage backed and cmbs securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. in such cases, more securities may fall to level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment. as such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation thereby resulting in values which may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. as of december 31, 2008, 14%, 70% and 16% of our available for sale securities were considered to be level 1, 2 and 3, respectively. evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other than temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations. the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, the company currently uses its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security under severe recession scenarios. in addition, estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. the determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. 26 table of contents additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. during the year ended december 31, 2008, the company concluded that approximately $4.0 billion of unrealized losses were other than temporarily impaired. additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities (which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities or other high yielding bonds) or reinsurance and derivative instrument counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud government intervention or other reasons. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, the underlying assets supporting our structured securities may deteriorate causing these securities to incur losses. for example, during the year ended december 31, 2008, the company incurred losses of $46 on derivative instruments due to counterparty default related to the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holding, inc. our investment portfolio includes investment securities in the financial services sector that have experienced nonperformance or defaults recently. further nonperformance or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, the value of our investments in hybrid securities, perpetual preferred securities, or other equity securities in the financial services sector may be significantly impaired if the issuers of such securities defer the payment of optional coupons or dividends, are forced to accept government support or intervention, or grant majority equity stakes to their respective governments. the company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the company stockholders equity other than u.s. government and u.s. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government and the japanese government. however, if the company creditors are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other creditors of the company s, the company credit concentration risk could increase above the 10% threshold, for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies. the availability of the company commercial paper program is dependent upon a variety of factors including the company ratings and market conditions. the company maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $2.0 billion. the company ability to borrow under its commercial paper program is dependent upon market conditions. on october 7, 2008, the federal reserve board authorized the commercial paper funding facility ( cpff ) to improve liquidity in short-term funding markets by increasing the availability of term commercial paper funding to issuers and by providing greater assurance to both issuers and investors that firms will be able to roll over their maturing commercial paper. the company registered with the cpff in order to sell up to a maximum of $375 to the facility, of which it has issued the full amount as of december 31, 2008. the company commercial paper must be rated a-1/p-1/f1 by at least two ratings agencies to be eligible for the program. moody s, p and fitch all recently downgraded our commercial paper rating, rendering the company ineligible to sell additional commercial paper under the cpff program going forward. as a result, we will be required to pay the maturing commercial paper issued under the cpff program from existing sources of liquidity. future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the commercial paper markets due to prevailing market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. 27 table of contents if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the company defers acquisition costs associated with the sales of its universal and variable life and variable annuity products. these costs are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ( dac ) asset. we amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb using components of estimated gross profits ( egps ). the projection of estimated gross profits requires the use of certain assumptions, principally related to separate account fund returns in excess of amounts credited to policyholders, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin, mortality, and hedging costs. of these factors, we anticipate that changes in investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. however, other factors such as those the company might employ to reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques could also significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future. if our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines persist, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb which would result in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. during the year ended december 31, 2008, the company recorded a $932, after-tax, charge related to the unlock. since september 30, 2008, the date of the last unlock, the actual return on u.s. variable annuity assets has been 21% below our estimated aggregate return. the company estimates the actual return would need to drop by an additional 6% from december 31, 2008 before egps in the company models fall outside of the statistical ranges of reasonable egps. since september 30, 2008, the date of the last unlock, the actual return on japan variable annuity assets has been 15.5% below our estimated aggregate return. the company estimates the actual return would need to drop by an additional 7.5% from december 31, 2008 before egps in the company models fall outside of the statistical ranges of reasonable egps. if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the company to limit risk. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. such write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. during 2008, the company took an impairment charge of $745, pre-tax, with respect to its individual annuity and international reporting units. if current market conditions persist during 2009, in particular, if the company share price remains below book value per share, or if the company actions to limit risk associated with its products or investments causes a significant change in any one reporting unit fair value, the company may need to reassess goodwill impairment at the end of each quarter as part of an annual or interim impairment test. subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in additional impairment of goodwill during 2009. deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. our valuation allowance of $75, as of december 31, 2008, based on future facts and circumstances may not be sufficient. charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 28 table of contents it is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. we believe that the actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos and environmental exposures. traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux. accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. although potential federal asbestos-related legislation has been considered in the senate, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be reconsidered or enacted in the future and, if so, what its effect would be on our aggregate asbestos liabilities. because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 is also limited. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. this would likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or periods affected and, if significant enough, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad. as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we may incur losses due to our reinsurers unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. as an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes or mortality, or other events that can cause unfavorable results of operations, through reinsurance. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. although we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results. in addition, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. historically, reinsurance pricing has changed significantly from time to time. no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. 29 table of contents our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable loss development. our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure. we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate. furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. to the extent we determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. depending on the severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we are particularly vulnerable to losses from the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made, the occurrence of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations and liquidity. our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. we also face substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism, disease pandemics and political instability. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states, and earthquakes in california and the new madrid region of the united states. we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. in the aftermath of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events were updated to incorporate medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. our life insurance operations are also exposed to risk of loss from catastrophes. for example, natural or man-made disasters or a disease pandemic such as could arise from avian flu, could significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience. policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment products. our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses or a further downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings from their levels as of february 10, 2009. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations and cash flows. competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the insurance industry is highly competitive. our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. in recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services firms that market products and services similar to ours. the current economic environment has only served to further increase competition. many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. these competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents and for our employees. larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. these highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. in addition, as actual or potential future downgrades occur, and if our competitors have not been similarly downgraded, sales of our products could be significantly reduced. because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 30 table of contents we may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. the company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. pervasive or dramatic changes in the judicial environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. similarly, changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other applicable laws could have the same effect. it is not possible to predict changes in the judicial and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and environmental reserves. similarly, changes in the judicial and legislative environment can adversely affect our ability to price our products. to the extent that judicial or legislative developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from our current expectations, they could have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we are subject to extensive laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non-governmental self-regulatory agencies, including foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the securities and exchange commission, the new york stock exchange, the financial industry regulatory authority, the u.s. department of justice, the office of thrift supervision, if our application for the u.s. treasury department capital purchase program is approved, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. in addition, there is risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment, even absent any change of interpretation by any particular regulator or enforcement authority, may cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; requiring insurers to dividend to policy holders any excess profits; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. 31 table of contents state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners, or naic, regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with similar related restrictions. our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. changes in these laws and regulations, or in the interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. compliance with these laws and regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. we distribute our annuity, life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through individual third-party arrangements. for example, we generated approximately 71% of our personal lines earned premium in 2008 under an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues until january 1, 2020. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues. as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity at the time it becomes known. limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. the hartford financial services group, inc. is a holding company with no significant operations. our principal asset is the stock of our insurance subsidiaries. state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments. limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt. as a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. we seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. state insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to an unacceptable returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. 32 table of contents additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. in a number of product lines and states, we continue to experience premium rate reductions. in these product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. even in a period of rate increases, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data due to the occurrence of disasters or other unanticipated events, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. we use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability, and the ability of certain affiliated third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. our systems could also be subject to physical and electronic break-ins, and subject to similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. this may impede or interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition or liquidity. if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct business may be compromised. we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties and expect to do so selectively in the future. if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy, third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. potential changes in federal or state tax laws, including changes impacting the availability of the separate account dividend received deduction, could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results or financial condition or liquidity. many of the products that the company sells benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, the company sells life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries. we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. other products that the company sells also enjoy similar, as well as other, types of tax advantages. the company also benefits from certain tax benefits, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions, tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions. there is risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company or its policyholders. this could occur in the context of deficit reduction or other tax reforms. the effects of any such changes could result in materially lower product sales, lapses of policies currently held, and/or our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 33 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is
