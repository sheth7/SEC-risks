advantages when compared to other marketing options available to packaged goods companies, retailers and other marketers. nam offers cost-effective programs that reach a national audience of engaged consumers who are actively seeking coupons or discounts and who are at a critical moment in their purchase decision. by delivering an immediate incentive or brand message to shoppers as they are making brand decisions, nam believes free-standing inserts and in-store advertising have an advantage over competing forms of mass media such as radio or television. the company news and information services products compete with a wide range of media businesses, including both print publications and digital media and information services. the company newspapers, magazines and digital publications compete for readership and advertising with local and national newspapers, web and application-based media, social media sources and other traditional media such as television, magazines, outdoor displays and radio. competition for print and digital subscriptions is based on the news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness results. in recent years, the newspaper industry has experienced difficulty increasing or maintaining circulation volume and revenue due to, among other factors, increased competition from new media formats and sources and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news from sources other than a newspaper, including digital sources available free of charge to consumers. the company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges within the newspaper industry, and that it is well positioned to continue to benefit from the transition to digital consumption. the company plans to leverage its global reach and brand recognition and its proprietary technology to expand its digital offerings, many of which are in early stages and have significant potential for growth. djx and other dow jones institutional products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers and global financial newswires, including thomson reuters, bloomberg l.p., lexisnexis, as well as many other internet-based providers of news and information. nam competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, including those that provide promotional or advertising inserts, direct mailers of promotional or advertising materials, providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store programs and providers of savings and/or grocery-focused digital applications, as well as other traditional media such as television, magazines, outdoor displays and radio. competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. the company believes that based on the circulation of its free-standing inserts, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the audience for its online programs, nam provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. cable network programming the company cable network programming

nelson, which harpercollins acquired in july 2012. harpercollins publishes works by well-known authors such as j.r.r. tolkien, paulo coelho, rick warren and agatha christie and popular titles such as the hobbit , goodnight moon and to kill a mockingbird . its active print and digital global catalog includes over 50,000 publications and approximately 100,000 skus, including various print and digital editions of the same title. harpercollins publishes fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on general, children and religious content. additionally, in the u.k., harpercollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the k-12 educational market. harpercollins is rapidly transitioning from print production to digital with leading e-book offerings. as of june 30, 2013, harpercollins offered approximately 30,000 e-book titles, which accounted for approximately 19% of global revenues in the quarter (up from approximately 16% in the prior year period). nearly all of harpercollins titles published in the last four years, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available in electronic reader and tablet formats. with the rapid adoption of electronic formats by consumers, harpercollins is publishing many titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. for example, through its popular romance imprint, avon, harpercollins launched a digital-first series which releases one new title per week in the romance category. the series has already generated three new york times electronic bestsellers since its launch. during fiscal 2013, harpercollins u.s. had 167 titles on the new york times bestseller list, with 16 titles hitting number one, including american sniper by chris kyle with scott mcewen and jim defelice , divergent by veronica roth , insurgent by veronica roth , pete the cat: rocking in my school shoes by eric litwin , the night before christmas by clement c. moore , the fallen angel by daniel silva, the 100 by jorge cruise, heaven is for real by todd burpo with lynn vincent, america the beautiful by ben carson with candy carson, beautiful ruins by jess walters, micro by michael crichton and richard preston, the one and only ivan , by katherine applegate, pete the cat saves christmas by eric litwin, emeraldalicious by victoria kann, and the elite by kiera cass. harpercollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including amazon, apple, barnes &amp; noble and tesco. as harper collins digital products continue to account for more of its business, it expects to benefit from increased profit contribution and improved working capital dynamics due to diminishing physical plant requirements, inventory and returns related to its print business, as well as faster payment for e-books. the book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations, including e-book devices sold by amazon, apple, google and barnes &amp; noble. harpercollins competes with other large publishers, such as penguin random house, simon &amp; schuster and hachette livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants, since barriers to entry in book publishing are low. in addition, harpercollins competes for readership with other media formats and sources. the company believes harpercollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies and as an early adopter of the digital model, where it is an industry leader with approximately 30,000 e-book titles. furthermore, harpercollins is a leader in children and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption. 11 table of contents other the other segment includes amplify, the company digital education business, the company corporate strategy and creative group, general corporate overhead expenses and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters. amplify in july 2012, the company launched amplify, the brand for its digital education business. amplify is dedicated to improving k-12 education by creating digital products and services that empower teachers, students and parents in new ways. its products serve more than 200,000 educators and three million students in all 50 states. amplify is focused on transforming teaching and learning by creating and scaling digital innovations in three areas: amplify insight: amplify successful data and analytics business, which formerly operated under the brand wireless generation, commenced operations in 2000 and was acquired in 2010. amplify insight provides powerful assessment products and services to support staff and technology development, including student assessment tools and analytic technologies, intervention programs, enterprise education information systems, and professional development and consulting services. key products include mclass tm , a suite of products that enable teachers to easily and quickly monitor individual and class progression through goals and standards and access detailed analysis, custom grouping and instructional planning tools. amplify learning : amplify nascent digital curriculum business is developing new content in english language arts, science and math, including software that will combine interactive, game-like experiences with rigorous analytics, all driven by adaptive technologies that respond to individual students needs as they evolve. amplify learning digital curriculum will incorporate the new common core state standards that is expected to be implemented in 45 states beginning with the 2014-2015 school year. amplify launched pilots of its new digital english and science curriculum for students in the middle grades during the 2013 fiscal year and is expected to launch additional pilots in fiscal 2014. amplify access: amplify distribution platform business, which is developing new distribution and delivery mechanisms, consists of an open tablet-based distribution platform that will offer curated third-party as well as proprietary curricular and extracurricular content, sophisticated analytic capabilities, a tablet, and 4g connectivity through a subscription-based bundle optimized for the k-12 market to facilitate personalized instruction and enable anywhere, anytime learning. amplify launched pilots of its new distribution platform for the classroom during fiscal 2013 and began a commercial rollout in fiscal 2014. amplify digital products are or will generally be available on a subscription basis. the company also expects to market and sell some supplemental print-based materials, as well as instructional and information technology-related services. in addition, while each of amplify products will be available on a stand-alone basis, the company also anticipates that it will have the ability to cross-sell products between amplify three business areas and offer bundled solutions to its customers. amplify competes with existing k-12 education publishers and content providers such as pearson plc and mcgraw-hill education, large platform companies such as google, apple, and amazon that market their tablet or e-reader products for educational use, as well as a number of smaller content, analytics and distribution platform companies. the company believes that amplify capabilities across analytics and assessment, content and curriculum and distribution and delivery make it well-positioned to offer schools a unique integrated learning solution. 12 table of contents corporate strategy and creative group the company corporate strategy and creative group was formed to identify new products and services across the company businesses to increase revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential acquisitions and investments. recent initiatives include the launch of the company ballball mobile app in japan, indonesia and vietnam, which combines the company rights to exclusive football highlight clips, expert coverage, commentary and analysis from the times , the sunday times and the sun , as well as the recently announced news corp global exchange, the company new global programmatic advertising exchange that will enable marketers to leverage the company leading online and mobile products and first-party data for real-time bidding. equity investments foxtel the company and telstra, an asx-listed telecommunications company, each own 50% of foxtel, the largest pay-tv provider in australia. foxtel has approximately 2.4 million subscribing households throughout australia, or over 30% of the country population, as of june 30, 2013 through cable, satellite and iptv distribution. foxtel delivers more than 200 channels (including standard definition channels, high definition versions of some of those channels, and audio and interactive channels) covering news, sport, general entertainment, movies, documentaries, music and children programming. foxtel premium content includes fox sports australia suite of sports channels such as fox sports 1, fox sports 2 and fox sports 3 and tv shows from hbo, fox and universal, among others. foxtel also owns and operates 26 channels, including general entertainment and movie channels, and sources an extensive range of movie programming through arrangements with major u.s. studios. foxtel channels are distributed to subscribers via both telstra hybrid fibrecoaxial cable network and a long-term contracted satellite platform provided by optus. foxtel offers limited versions of its services via broadband through foxtel play (an internet television service), the xbox platform, telstra t-box platform, select samsung televisions, a number of virgin australia aircraft, and mobile devices and tablets (including ipads and iphones via foxtel go), as well as via the internet to personal computers. foxtel customers are also able to access their electronic programming guide via their tablet, mobile devices and personal computers to remotely record programming. foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue. for the year ended june 30, 2013, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ), foxtel recorded revenues of $3.2 billion, net income before income taxes of $267 million, net interest expense of $231 million, depreciation and amortization of $441 million, calculated before purchase accounting adjustments, and equity earnings of affiliates and other, net, of $7 million. foxtel ebitda, which is calculated by excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization and equity earnings of affiliates and other, net, from net income before income taxes, was $932 million for the year ended june 30, 2013. management believes that ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of this business for the reasons set forth in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations segment analysis with respect to segment ebitda. in the year ended june 30, 2013, foxtel average residential recurring subscription revenue per user, or arpu, was $97 per month (as calculated by foxtel), and its annualized residential subscriber churn rate based on data for the year ended june 30, 2013 was 14.2% (as calculated by foxtel). in addition, foxtel had $2.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding as of june 30, 2013 (excluding $825 million of shareholder loans due to telstra and the company, which includes accrued interest payable of $15 million), and paid distributions of $159 million to the company during the year ended june 30, 2013. in november 2012, the company stake in foxtel increased from 25% to 50% as a result of the cmh acquisition. the amount included for foxtel in the company equity earnings of affiliates was $66 million for the year ended june 30, 2013. 13 table of contents the company and telstra each have the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of foxtel. in addition, the company has the right to appoint the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of foxtel, while telstra has the right to terminate these officers. foxtel competes primarily with the three major commercial fta networks and two major government-funded fta broadcasters in australia for subscribers, as well as other pay-tv operators and iptv providers. foxtel provides a 200-plus channel selection with premium and exclusive content and a wide array of digital and mobile features that are not available to viewers on the fta networks. through innovations such as digital hd channels, the extension of pay-tv programming to mobile devices and the use of dvr and electronic program guide technology, the company believes foxtel offers subscribers a compelling alternative to fta tv and foxtel other competitors. governmental regulation general various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. the company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and regulations described herein. the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the company interests. australian media regulation the company subscription television interests are subject to australia regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry. the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority ( acma ). key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions currently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 (cth), subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; (b) the broadcasting services act this legislation may impact the company ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including, for example, preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area; and (c) convergence review on april 30, 2012, the then-minister for broadband, communications and the digital economy released the final report of a comprehensive review of australia communications and media regulation in light of increasing convergence in media platforms. the report covered a number of broad areas, including media ownership laws, media content standards, the ongoing production and distribution of australian and local content and the allocation of radio communications spectrum. in march 2013, legislation was passed in response to the convergence review that, among other things, reduced the license fees payable by fta networks by 50%. no legislation has yet been introduced removing the prohibition on an fta network signal reaching greater than 75% of the australian population. any further changes in australian media regulations could adversely impact the company australian businesses. however, the government that commissioned the convergence review lost power in the australian federal election held on september 7, 2013. 14 table of contents u.k. press regulation on july 13, 2011, prime minister david cameron announced a two-part inquiry into the u.k. press and appointed lord justice leveson as chairman of the inquiry. the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company former publication, the news of the world . hearings opened on november 14, 2011 with respect to the first part of the inquiry, and lord justice leveson published his report on november 29, 2012. the report made recommendations on the future of press regulation and governance in the u.k., which have been the subject of debate in the u.k. parliament, as well as discussion both among newspaper groups (including news uk) and the industry and the government. on march 18, 2013, the u.k. government published a draft royal charter on self-regulation of the press which, if granted, would establish a recognition panel that would be responsible for recognizing, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body. the new press regulatory body, a majority of the members of which would be independent of the industry, would be responsible for overseeing the u.k. press and would replace the existing press complaints commission. the u.k. government has also proposed legislation which would ensure that the royal charter could only be altered by a two-thirds majority of parliament. in addition to the royal charter and establishment of a new regulatory body, rules have been proposed which, if adopted, would result in publishers who do not participate in this new u.k. press regulatory system being potentially liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded. on april 24, 2013, an alternative proposed form of royal charter was published by a group representing a significant majority of the u.k. press, including news uk. this contained many similar provisions but omitted or varied several others, including the requirement for any future alteration to be approved by a two-thirds majority of parliament. while a new regulatory regime is supported by the primary political parties in the u.k. and is likely to be introduced, at this time it remains unclear what precise form the new regime will take and when it will come into force. the new u.k. press regulatory body is likely to, among other things, introduce and oversee a revised press code, require members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and require self-reporting of any failures, provide a complaints handling service, have the ability to require publications to print corrections, have the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code and be able to levy fines. it may also introduce an arbitration service to resolve claims against publications. changes may also be made to u.k. data protection legislation. if adopted, the proposed new regulatory regime may impose burdens on the print media, including the company newspaper businesses in the u.k., that represent competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance. a date has yet to be set for the second part of the inquiry. internet in the u.s., the children online privacy protection act of 1998 ( coppa ) prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. in addition, the controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act of 2003 ( can-spam ) regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or spam. online services provided by the company may be subject to coppa and can-spam requirements. u.s. federal regulators interest in issues of privacy, cybersecurity and data security has been steadily increasing. on february 23, 2012, the obama administration issued a white paper on consumer data privacy that includes a consumer privacy bill of rights. the obama administration is convening a multi-stakeholder process to implement the bill of rights through industry codes of conduct that would be enforceable by the federal trade commission ( ftc ) and state attorneys general. the obama administration also announced it would work with congress to implement these rights through legislation. on march 26, 2012, the ftc released a report 15 table of contents on consumer privacy, which sets forth a detailed privacy framework and urges industry to accelerate the pace of adoption of self-regulatory measures, including more widespread adoption of a do-not-track browser mechanism. the report also recommends that congress consider baseline privacy legislation incorporating the principles articulated in the framework. a number of privacy and data security bills have been introduced in both houses of congress that address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, data security and breach notification requirements, and cybersecurity. several congressional hearings have examined privacy implications for online, offline and mobile data. some state legislatures have already adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate on the internet, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. the industry released a set of self-regulatory online behavioral advertising principles in 2009, which have been implemented by web publishers, online advertisers and online advertising networks. in november 2011, these principles were extended to the use of online consumer data for purposes other than advertising. it is unclear whether these and other industry self-regulatory efforts alone will address the concerns expressed by some federal and state officials about the collection of anonymous data online or via mobile applications to serve targeted content and advertising. it is not possible to predict whether proposed privacy and data security legislation will be enacted or to determine what effect such legislation might have on the company business. foreign governments are raising similar privacy and data security concerns. in particular, the eu has proposed a new privacy regulation (the eu regulation ) that would replace the current data protection directive, would tighten regulation of the collection, use and security of online data and would continue to restrict the trans-border flow of data. european industry has implemented a self-regulatory regime for online behavioral advertising that is largely consistent with the u.s. self-regulatory framework. the proposed eu regulation will not be effective for at least two or three years and may undergo many changes before it is adopted. it is unclear how the final eu regulation would affect the company business. the company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments. education the availability of funding for k-12 education is affected by changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, as well as changes in the state procurement process. future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues resulting in a decrease in educational funding. intellectual property the company intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. policing unauthorized use of the company products, services and content and related intellectual property is often 16 table of contents difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company intellectual property. the company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company operations. moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2013, the company had approximately 24,000 employees, of whom approximately 9,000 were located in the u.s., 4,000 were located in the u.k. and 9,000 were located in australia. of the company employees, approximately 6,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report in evaluating the company and its common stock. if any of the following risks develop into actual events, it could materially and adversely affect the company business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company common stock. the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to the company business, risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox and risks related to the company common stock. risks related to the company business a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its newspapers, integrated marketing services and digital media properties. the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and pay-tv programming. expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. national and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation and circulation levels and rates all impact demand for advertising. a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective 17 table of contents advertisers spending priorities. the company advertising revenues in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 declined 7% as compared to the prior year, due in large part to lower advertising revenues at its australian newspapers as a result of the weaker australian economy, particularly among consumers, as well as, to a lesser extent, declines in advertising revenues at dow jones. these declines were offset, in part, by increased revenues in the company digital real estate services segment. in addition to economic conditions, other factors such as consolidation across various industries may also reduce the company overall advertising revenue. demand for the company products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. for example, circulation levels for the company newspapers and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates. in addition, newer technologies, including new downloading capabilities via the internet, digital distribution models for books and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media choices available to audiences. these technological developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company offerings to advertisers. in addition, the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. consequently, the company digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company customers, reduced demand for the company offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company businesses and assets. advertising, circulation and audience share may continue to decline as consumers migrate to other media alternatives. the company businesses face competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content delivery, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues in the company news and information services segment may continue to decline, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers increasing reliance on the internet for the delivery of news and information, often without charge. in recent years, internet sites devoted to recruitment, automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales. as a result, in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, the company advertising revenues decreased 10% in the news and information services segment as compared to the prior year. in addition, due to innovations in content distribution platforms, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices, in some cases also without charge, which could reduce consumer demand for the company television programming and pay-tv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers willingness to purchase television advertising from the company. the company must respond to changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet, often without charge, and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internet-delivered content on portable devices and televisions. there is a risk that the company responses to these changes and strategies to remain competitive, including distribution of its content on a pay basis, may not be adopted by consumers. in addition, enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership, which could negatively affect the company revenues. the trend toward digital media 18 table of contents may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content. the company failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new products and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses, asset values and results of operations. the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company australian operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period. the sports rights contracts between certain of the company australian operating businesses, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. as these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. in addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and could adversely affect its revenues. upon renewal, the company results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. no assurance of profitability of amplify. many of amplify newer lines of business are still under development. accordingly, amplify prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as digital education. these risks for amplify include, but are not limited to, an evolving business model and the management of growth. amplify must, among other things, develop a customer base for its full range of offerings, including by utilizing the existing customers associated with its data and analytics business, implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy, continue to develop and upgrade its software and content offerings, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. since the 2010 acquisition of wireless generation, the former brand of amplify data and analytics business, now amplify insight, and the initiation of the development of the broader business initiatives of amplify, the company digital education business has recorded a cumulative loss before income taxes of approximately $265 million through june 30, 2013. the portion of this loss recognized in the year ended june 30, 2013 was approximately $163 million. losses are expected to be higher in fiscal 2014 as a result of continued product development efforts. significant expenses associated with amplify businesses include salaries, employee benefits and other routine overhead associated with product development. there can be no assurance that amplify will be successful in addressing these risks or in achieving these goals, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on amplify business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. the company may make strategic acquisitions that could introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company may make strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) the risk of diverting the attention of the company senior management from the company operations, (5) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (6) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (7) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business and (8) in some cases, increased regulation. if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with the company existing business, the company business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 19 table of contents global economic conditions may have a continuing adverse effect on the company business. the u.s. and global economies have undergone a period of economic uncertainty, which caused, among other things, a general tightening in the credit markets, limited access to the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending and lower consumer net worth. the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. a continued decline in these economic conditions could further impact the company business, reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers, books, television operations and other consumer products. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company. in particular, the company has significant exposure to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets. as a result, the company results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market. although the company believes that its capitalization and operating cash flow will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair the company liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company does not have the right to manage foxtel, which means it is not able to cause foxtel to operate or make corporate decisions in a manner that is favorable to the company. the company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of foxtel. while the company rights include the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of foxtel, the company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf, including with regards to declaring and paying dividends. the company faces investigations regarding allegations of voicemail interception, illegal data access, inappropriate payments to public officials, obstruction of justice and other related matters and related civil lawsuits. u.k. and u.s. regulators and governmental authorities are conducting investigations relating to voicemail interception, illegal data access, inappropriate payments to public officials and obstruction of justice at its former publication, the news of the world , and at the sun , and related matters, which are referred to as the u.k. newspaper matters. the investigation by the u.s. department of justice (the doj ) is directed at conduct that occurred within 21st century fox prior to the creation of the company. accordingly, 21st century fox has been and continues to be responsible for responding to the doj investigation. the company, together with 21st century fox, is cooperating with these investigations. the company has admitted liability in many civil cases related to the voicemail interception allegations and has settled many cases. the company also announced a private compensation scheme under which parties could pursue claims against it. while additional civil lawsuits may be filed, no additional civil claims may be brought under the compensation scheme after april 8, 2013. the company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims or criminal matters. from july 1, 2010 through june 30, 2013, the company incurred aggregate legal and professional fees related to the u.k. newspaper matters of $307 million and paid $23 million to claimants for civil settlements. in addition, as of june 30, 2013, the company has provided for its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed and costs incurred and has accrued $66 million. certain liabilities recorded by the company in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 related to matters that will be indemnified by 21st century fox as described below. accordingly, the company also recorded an indemnification asset of approximately $40 million as of june 30, 2013. 20 table of contents in connection with the separation, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that 21st century fox will indemnify the company for payments made after the distribution date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the u.k. newspaper matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees (i) who are not directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, who are not co-defendants with the company or 21st century fox. in addition, violations of law may result in criminal fines or penalties for which the company will not be indemnified by 21st century fox. 21st century fox indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an after-tax basis. it is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof, including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea, judgment or similar result for which the company will not be indemnified, could damage its reputation, impair the company ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 11 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation for additional information. the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company industry and challenging economic and market conditions, the company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill and intangible assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company financial results. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, as part of its long-range planning process in preparation for the separation, the company adjusted its future outlook and related strategy principally with respect to its news and information services business in australia and secondarily with respect to its news and information services businesses in the u.s. these adjustments reflect adverse trends affecting the company news and information services segment, including declines in advertising revenue and continued declines in the economic environment in australia, and resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows. consequently, the company determined that the fair value of these reporting units had declined below their respective carrying values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion ($1.1 billion, net of tax) in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013. in response to these challenging conditions the company has reorganized its australian newspaper businesses, and the company recognized $293 million of restructuring charges in the year ended june 30, 2013, a significant portion of which resulted from its restructuring activities in australia and the u.k. in accordance with gaap, the company will continue to perform an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads and distribution networks, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for an analysis of the sensitivity of the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets to changes in key assumptions. any further downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required. any such charge could be material to the company reported results of operations. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on its interests. 21 table of contents for example, the company australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event; the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and legislation such as the broadcasting services act that regulates ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. for example, current media diversity rules would prevent the company from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. on april 30, 2012, the then-minister for broadband, communications and digital economy released the final report of a comprehensive review of australia communications and media regulation referred to as the convergence review. in march 2013, legislation was passed in response to the convergence review that, among other things, reduced the license fees payable by fta networks. certain other legislative changes that would have had a significant impact on the way the company operates its business and which would have limited its ability to acquire new businesses were proposed by the australian government, but withdrawn without becoming law. any further changes in australian media regulations could adversely impact the company australian businesses. however, the government that commissioned the convergence review lost power in the australian federal election held on september 7, 2013. in addition, the company newspaper businesses in the u.k. are likely to be subject to greater regulation and oversight following the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid-2011. the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company former publication, the news of the world . lord justice leveson, chairman of the inquiry, has concluded the first part of the inquiry and published a report in late november 2012 containing various recommendations for greater regulation and oversight of the u.k. press. in response, the u.k. government has proposed establishing a regulatory body to oversee the u.k. press, a majority of the members of which would be independent of the industry. if adopted, a new regulatory regime may impose burdens on the print media in the u.k., including the company newspaper businesses in the u.k., that represent competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance. the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in educational funding. the company u.s. educational businesses may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, changes in the state procurement process and changes in the condition of the local, state or u.s. economy. future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues that result in a decrease in educational funding. newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control. newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company publishing units. during the year ended june 30, 2013, the company average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 3.0% higher than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile 22 table of contents and the consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers, which has led to increases in newsprint prices. failure to maintain the company current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain the company existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future. the company relies on network and information systems and other technology that may be subject to disruption or misuse, which could result in improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information as well as increased costs or loss of revenue. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company network management, are important to its business activities. network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, could result in a disruption of the company services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information. improper disclosure of such information could harm the company reputation, require it to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or subject it to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company ability to protect its intellectual property rights. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. the company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, protection of the company intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. there can be no assurance that the company efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy. the company business relies on certain intellectual property and brands. the company businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names. the company believes its proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. any impairment of any such intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company results of operations or financial condition. fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company results of operations. the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the u.s. dollar. as a result, the company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company business. in a variety of the company businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well 23 table of contents as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox if the separation, together with certain related transactions, were ultimately determined to be taxable transactions for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then the company, 21st century fox and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability, and the company may be required to indemnify 21st century fox for tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox. in connection with the separation, 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of the company class a common stock and class b common stock qualified as tax-free under sections 368 and 355 of the code except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. in addition, 21st century fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the separation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, including the satisfaction of the requirements under section 368 and 355 of the code not specifically addressed in the irs private letter ruling. the opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the separation. if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and u.s. stockholders and certain non-u.s. stockholders could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. in addition, if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st century fox would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and/or recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company common stock distributed to 21st century fox stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox tax basis in such shares. as described below, the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation, the company will, in certain circumstances, be responsible for all taxes, including interest and penalties, and tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation. specifically, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, or (3) the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination. the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox. each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group, which, prior to the separation, included 21st century fox, the company and 21st century fox other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the u.s. federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the 24 table of contents separation. consequently, the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any member of 21st century fox consolidated group. the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify. the company might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the separation because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the company ability to engage in significant strategic transactions and equity issuances may be limited or restricted after the separation in order to preserve, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution by 21st century fox. even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code, it may result in corporate level taxable gain to 21st century fox under section 355(e) of the code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of the company stock is acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. to preserve the tax-free treatment to 21st century fox of the distribution and the internal transactions in connection with the distribution for u.s. federal income tax purposes, under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company entered into with 21st century fox, the company is prohibited from taking or failing to take certain actions that may prevent the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes. further, for the two-year period following the separation, without obtaining the consent of 21st century fox, the company may be prohibited from: approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than a specified percentage of the company common stock, a merger, a redemption of equity securities, a sale or other disposition of certain businesses or a specified percentage of the company assets, an acquisition of a business or assets with equity securities to the extent one or more persons would acquire in excess of a specified percentage of the company common stock, or amending the company organizational documents or taking any other action through stockholder vote or otherwise that affects the relative economic or voting rights of the company outstanding stock. these restrictions may limit the company ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of its business. moreover, the tax sharing and indemnification agreement also provides that the company is responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the separation by or in respect of the company or any of its affiliates. the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the u.s. the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks and newspapers (the broadcast ownership rules ) and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest (the program access rules ). under the fcc rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the murdoch family trust ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules. consequently, the company future 25 table of contents conduct, including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator, may affect 21st century fox ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules, or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules. therefore, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires, after the distribution date, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the u.s. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business, then the company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. in addition, the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor, including a cable television operator, if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject. this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business. the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements, 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities, and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century fox for certain liabilities. as a result, the company could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates representations, covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement, tax sharing and indemnification agreement or any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation. the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities. certain agreements that the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may limit its ability to take certain actions with respect to the civil u.k. newspaper matters. under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement, in consideration for 21st century fox agreement to certain indemnification arrangements, the company agreed that 21st century fox would have the right to control the company defense of civil claims relating to the u.k. newspaper matters. in exercising its rights to control the defense of the civil claims relating to the u.k. newspaper matters, 21st century fox may be guided by interests that are different than or adverse to the company interests and the interests of its stockholders and advocate strategies that the company management would not otherwise adopt. furthermore, if the company fails to comply with these control arrangements or does not consent to settlements with respect to such matters proposed by 21st century fox, the company has agreed with 21st century fox that it will, at 21st century fox discretion, forego any indemnification with regard to such or all of these matters. the company inability to take actions with respect to these civil matters without 21st century fox consent or the company adoption of strategies advocated by 21st century fox could damage the company reputation or impair the company ability to conduct its business while the taking of any such action by the company without 21st century fox consent in breach of the company agreements could increase its liability exposure with regard to such matters and adversely affect the company results of operations and financial condition. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 11 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation for additional information. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. from time to time the company may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the company access to, 26 table of contents and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the company financial performance, (2) the company credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance, particularly as a new company that currently has no credit rating, that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company. by separating from 21st century fox, there is a risk that the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while it was still a part of 21st century fox. as part of 21st century fox, the company was able to enjoy certain benefits from 21st century fox operating diversity and access to capital for investments, which benefits are no longer available to the company after the separation. as an independent, publicly-traded company, the company believes that its businesses will benefit from, among other things, sharpened focus on the financial and operational resources of its specific business, allowing the company management to design and implement a capital structure, corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the business characteristics and strategic opportunities of its businesses. the company anticipates this will allow it to respond more effectively to industry dynamics and to create effective incentives for the company management and employees that are more closely tied to its business performance. however, the company may not be able to achieve some or all of the expected benefits. if the company fails to achieve some or all of the benefits in the time it expects, the company business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. the company has a very limited operating history as an independent, publicly-traded company, and its historical financial statements are not necessarily representative of the results it would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company and may not be reliable indicators of its future results. the company historical financial statements included in this annual report do not necessarily reflect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that it would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that it will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the following factors: historically, the company working capital requirements and capital for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were provided by 21st century fox to the extent the company did not generate sufficient cash flows to cover its cash requirements. 21st century fox historically managed and retained the cash generated by the company. following the separation, 21st century fox no longer provides the company with funds to finance its working capital or other cash requirements. without the opportunity to obtain capital from 21st century fox, the company may need to access capital markets, and there is no guarantee that capital will be available to the company or available on terms that are as favorable as those it could have obtained when it was part of 21st century fox. prior to the separation, the company business was operated by 21st century fox as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. 21st century fox historically performed various corporate functions for the company, including, but not limited to, tax administration, treasury activities, accounting, legal, ethics and compliance program administration, investor and public relations, certain governance functions (including internal audit) and external reporting. the company historical financial statements reflect allocations of corporate expenses from 21st century fox for these and similar functions. however, these allocations may be more or less than the comparable expenses that the company would have incurred had it operated as an independent, publicly traded company. other significant changes may occur in the company cost structure, management, financing, business operations, personnel needs, tax and structure as a result of its operation as a company separate from 21st century fox. the company benefited from 21st century fox operating diversity, size and 27 table of contents purchasing power, and it will lose such benefits as an independent company. additionally, the company will be entering into transactions with 21st century fox that did not exist prior to the separation. the company accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which it is subject following the separation. if the company is unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls, its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of 21st century fox, and the company believes that its reporting and control systems were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company. however, the company was not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the exchange act. as a result of the separation, the company is directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the exchange act. further, beginning with the company annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ending june 30, 2014, it will be required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002, which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting and a report by its independent registered public accounting firm. these reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on the company management and administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources. to comply with these requirements, the company may need to upgrade its systems, including information technology, and implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. the company expects to incur additional annual expenses related to these steps, and those expenses may be significant. if the company is unable to upgrade its financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, the company ability to comply with its financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the exchange act could be impaired. any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. certain of the company directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox, and certain of the company officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of 21st century fox, which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox. certain of the company directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of 21st century fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company executive chairman and the chairman and chief executive officer of 21st century fox, and gerson zweifach, who serves as the company general counsel and as senior executive vice president and group general counsel of 21st century fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement, the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may 28 table of contents become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates. the company restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company restated certificate of incorporation) to 21st century fox instead of the company. as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation, the provisions in the company restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company. risks related to the company common stock the market price of the company stock may fluctuate significantly the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the company quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company operating results; (3) success or failure of the company business strategy; (4) the company ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (12) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (13) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. certain provisions of the company certificate of incorporation, by-laws, tax sharing and indemnification agreement, separation and distribution agreement and delaware law, the company stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; stockholders to remove directors only for cause; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; special stockholders meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. 29 table of contents these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. in addition, in connection with the separation, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement pursuant to which each outstanding share of the company common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company class b common stock as of may 24, 2013. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. acquisitions of shares of the company class b common stock as a result of acquiring additional 21st century fox class b common stock prior to the separation or shares representing the company class b common stock in the when-issued trading market or as a result of the separation will each be included in determining the beneficial ownership of a person, and all such acquisitions made after may 24, 2013 will be taken into account in determining whether a person is an acquiring person under the terms of the stockholder rights agreement. the rights expire on june 28, 2014, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company class b common stock as of september 10, 2013, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company class b common stock and less than one percent of the company class a common stock as of september 10, 2013. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company class b common stock as of september 10, 2013. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 67 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and stock prices. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. the following sections provide quantitative information on the company exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and stock price risk. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. foreign currency exchange rates the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. foreign operations. because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. currency exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years. the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2013 and 2012: u.s. dollars australian dollars british pound sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 revenues 52 % 31 % 17 % operating expenses 53 % 29 % 18 % fiscal year ended june 30, 2012 revenues 52 % 32 % 16 % operating expenses 53 % 28 % 19 % based on the year ended june 30, 2013, a one cent change in both the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling rates will impact revenues by approximately $28 million and $23 million, respectively, on an annual basis, and will impact total segment ebitda by approximately $4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, on an annual basis. stock prices the company has one common stock investment in a publicly traded company that is subject to market price volatility. this investment is a cost method investment which is not material. as a result, the company has limited exposure to stock price risk. 67 table of contents credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. the company receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30, 2013 or june 30, 2012 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the company products and services are sold. the company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are

and digital publications compete for readership and advertising with local and national newspapers, web and application-based media, social media sources and other traditional media such as television, magazines, outdoor displays and radio. competition for print and digital subscriptions and circulation is based on the news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness results. as a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the company news and information services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue from a variety of alternative news and information sources. these include both paid and free websites, digital applications, news aggregators, blogs, search engines, social media platforms, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms. shifts in consumer behavior, including the rapid adoption of mobile phones, tablets, electronic readers and other portable devices as platforms through which news and information is consumed, require the company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. the company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes. dow jones professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers and global financial newswires, including thomson reuters, bloomberg l.p., lexisnexis, as well as many other internet-based providers of news and information. nam competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and

providers of savings and/or grocery-focused digital applications, as well as other media platforms such as television, magazines, outdoor displays and radio. competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. the company believes that based on the circulation of its free-standing inserts, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the audience for its online programs, nam provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. cable network programming the company cable network programming segment consists of fox sports australia, the leading sports programming provider in australia based on total subscribers as of june 30, 2014. fox sports australia is focused on live national and international sports events and provides featured original and licensed premium sports content tailored to the australian

), one of the largest english-language consumer publishers in the world based on global revenue, with operations in the u.s., the u.k., canada, australia, new zealand and india. harpercollins publishes and distributes consumer books globally through print, digital and audio formats. its digital formats include electronic books, also referred to as e-books, for devices such as the apple ipad, amazon kindle, google nexus and barnes &amp; noble nook as well as audio downloads for smartphones and mp3 players. harpercollins owns over 60 branded imprints, including avon, harper, harpercollins children publishers, william morrow and christian publishers zondervan and thomas nelson, which harpercollins acquired in july 2012. in addition, in august 2014, harpercollins acquired harlequin enterprises limited, a leading publisher of women fiction, from torstar corporation, extending its global platform, particularly in europe and asia pacific. harpercollins publishes works by well-known authors such as mitch albom, veronica roth, rick warren and agatha christie and popular titles such as the hobbit , goodnight moon , to kill a mockingbird and the divergent series. its active print and digital global catalog includes approximately 50,000 publications and over 100,000 skus, including various print and digital editions of the same title. harpercollins publishes fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on general, children and religious content. additionally, in the u.k., harpercollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the k-12 educational market. harpercollins is rapidly transitioning from print production to digital with leading e-book offerings. as of june 30, 2014, harpercollins offered approximately 35,000 e-book titles, which accounted for approximately 22% of global consumer revenues in the quarter (up from approximately 19% in the prior year period). nearly all of harpercollins titles published in the last five years, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available in electronic reader and tablet formats. with the rapid adoption of electronic formats by consumers, harpercollins is publishing many titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. for example, through its popular romance imprint, avon, harpercollins launched a digital-first series which releases at least one new title per week in the romance category. the series has already generated nine new york times electronic bestsellers since its launch. during fiscal 2014, harpercollins u.s. had 158 titles on the new york times bestseller list, with 17 titles hitting number one, including divergent (series) by veronica roth, the 100 by jorge cruise, heaven is for real by todd burpo with lynn vincent, the body book by cameron diaz with sandra bark, the first phone call from heaven by mitch albom, the ocean at the end of the lane by neil gaiman, the pioneer woman cooks: a year of holidays by ree drummond, 10 % happier by dan harris, the english girl by daniel silva, eat to live cookbook by joel fuhrman, the undead pool by kim harrison, orphan train by christina baker kline, the daniel plan by rick warren, daniel amen, &amp; mark hyman, pete the cat: the wheels on the bus by james dean, pete the cat and his magic sunglasses by kimberly &amp; james dean, and the selection by kiera cass. harpercollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including amazon, apple, barnes &amp; noble and tesco. as harpercollins digital products continue to account for more of its business, it expects to benefit from increased profit contribution and improved working capital dynamics due to diminishing physical plant requirements, inventory and returns related to its print business, as well as faster payment for e-books. revenues at the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of harpercollins books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the company second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. the book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations, including e-book devices sold by amazon, apple, google and barnes &amp; noble. harpercollins competes with other large publishers, such as penguin random house, simon &amp; schuster and 11 table of contents hachette livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants, since barriers to entry in book publishing are low. in addition, harpercollins competes for readership with other media formats and sources. the company believes harpercollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies and as an early adopter of the digital model, where it is an industry leader with approximately 35,000 e-book titles. furthermore, harpercollins is a leader in children and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption. digital education the company digital education segment consists of amplify, the brand for its digital education business, which it launched in july 2012. amplify is focused on

subscription basis. the company also expects to market and sell some supplemental print-based materials, as well as instructional and information technology-related services. in addition, while each of amplify products will be available on a stand-alone basis, the company also anticipates that it will have the ability to cross-sell products between amplify three business areas and offer bundled solutions to its customers. amplify competes with existing k-12 education publishers and content providers such as pearson plc, mcgraw-hill education and houghton mifflin harcourt, large platform companies such as google, apple, and amazon that market their tablet or e-reader products for educational use, as well as a number of smaller content, analytics and distribution platform companies. the company believes that amplify capabilities across analytics and assessment, content and curriculum and distribution and delivery make it well positioned to offer schools a unique integrated learning solution. other the other segment includes the company general corporate overhead expenses, corporate strategy and creative group and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters. the company corporate strategy and creative group was formed to identify new products and services across the company businesses to increase 12 table of contents revenues and profitability and to target and

accepted accounting principles ( gaap ), foxtel recorded revenues of $2.9 billion and earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or ebitda, of $903 million. management believes that ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of this business for the reasons set forth in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations segment analysis with respect to segment ebitda. in the year ended june 30, 2014, foxtel average residential recurring subscription revenue per user, or arpu, was a$96 (us$88) per month (as calculated by foxtel), and its annualized residential subscriber churn rate based on data for the year ended june 30, 2014 was 12.5% (as calculated by foxtel). in addition,

have the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of foxtel. in addition, the company has the right to appoint the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of foxtel, while telstra has the right to terminate these officers. foxtel competes primarily with the three major commercial fta networks and two major government-funded fta broadcasters in australia for audiences, as well as other pay-tv operators and iptv providers. 13 table of contents foxtel provides a 200-plus channel selection with premium and exclusive content and a wide array of digital and mobile features that are not available to viewers on the fta networks. through innovations such as digital hd channels, the extension of pay-tv programming to mobile devices and the use of dvr and electronic program guide technology, the company believes foxtel offers subscribers a compelling alternative to fta tv and foxtel other competitors. governmental regulation general various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. the company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and regulations described herein. the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the company interests. australian media regulation the company subscription television interests are subject to australia regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry. the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority. key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions currently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 (cth), subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) the broadcasting services act this legislation may impact the company ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including, for example, preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. u.k. press regulation on july 13, 2011, prime minister david cameron announced a two-part inquiry into the u.k. press and appointed lord justice leveson as chairman of the inquiry. the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company former publication, the news of the world . hearings opened on november 14, 2011 with respect to the first part of the inquiry, and lord justice leveson published his report on november 29, 2012. the report made recommendations on the future of press regulation and governance in the u.k., which have been the subject of debate in the u.k. parliament, as well as discussion both among newspaper groups (including news uk) and the industry and the government. a date has yet to be set for the second part of the inquiry. on march 18, 2013, the u.k. government published a draft royal charter on self-regulation of the press which, if granted, would establish a recognition panel that would be responsible for recognizing, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body. the new press regulatory body, a majority of the members of which would be independent of the industry, would be responsible for overseeing the u.k. press and would replace the existing press complaints commission. the u.k. government also proposed legislation which would ensure that the royal charter could only be altered by a two-thirds majority of parliament. in addition to the royal charter and establishment of a new regulatory body, rules have been proposed which, if adopted, would result in publishers who do not participate in this new u.k. press regulatory system being potentially liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded. 14 table of contents in late 2013, publications representing the majority of the industry in the u.k., including news uk, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, which is referred to as the independent press standards organisation. since then, steps have been taken to form the new regulator and appoint an independent chairman and its board. the new regulator is expected to be operational by september 2014. the new regulator will, among other things, oversee the press code of practice, require members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and require self-reporting of any failures, provide a complaints handling service, have the ability to require publications to print corrections, have the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code and be able to levy fines. it may also introduce an arbitration service to resolve claims against publications. when established, the new regulatory regime will impose burdens on the print media, including the company newspaper businesses in the u.k., which may represent competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance. data privacy and security our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve in light of changes in information technology and analytics techniques that have implications for how such data is managed. for example, in the u.s., the company websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the children online privacy protection act of 1998, which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent, and the controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act of 2003, which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or spam. in addition, regulators such as the federal trade commission continue to expand their application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. many states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security, including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates, including the european union and australia. the european union is currently considering a new privacy regulation that would replace its existing data protection directive and, if adopted in its current proposed form, would expand the regulation of the collection, use and security of personal data, continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, introduce an expanded right of individuals to have their data deleted upon request, enhance penalties for non-compliance and increase the enforcement powers of the european commission. in australia, recent changes in data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers and placing restrictions on direct marketing practices, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. in response to such developments, industry participants in the u.s., europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the company, to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. the company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments. education the availability of funding for k-12 education is affected by changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, as well as changes in the state procurement process. future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues and resulting decreases in educational funding that could, in turn, have an adverse impact on the company digital education business. 15 table of contents intellectual property the company intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. policing unauthorized use of the company products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company intellectual property. the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company operations. moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2014, the company had approximately 22,000 employees, of whom approximately 7,000 were located in the u.s., 4,000 were located in the u.k. and 9,000 were located in australia. of the company employees, approximately 6,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. 16 table of contents item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report in evaluating the company and its common stock. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company common stock. the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to the company business, risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox and risks related to the company common stock. risks related to the company business a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its newspapers, integrated marketing services and digital media properties. the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and pay-tv programming. expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. national and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates and job creation all impact demand for advertising. a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the company overall advertising revenue. the company ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company products, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. for example, circulation levels for the company newspapers, the number of visits to its websites and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates. newer technologies, including new streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet and other devices and technologies, as well as growing consumer engagement with new forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. these technological developments may also cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company offerings to advertisers. in addition, the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. consequently, the company digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company customers, reduced demand for the company offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company businesses and assets. advertising, circulation and audience share may continue to decline as consumers migrate to other media alternatives. the company businesses face competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content delivery, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues in the company news and information services segment may continue to decline, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers increasing reliance on the internet for the delivery of news and information, often without charge. in recent years, internet sites devoted to recruitment, automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales. in addition, due to innovations in content distribution platforms, consumers are now 17 table of contents more readily able to watch internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices, in some cases also without charge, which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates television programming and pay-tv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers willingness to purchase television advertising from the company. the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading. these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet, often without charge, and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internet-delivered content on portable devices and televisions. enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership, which could negatively affect the company revenues. new digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the cost of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing additional digital content providers to compete with us, often at a lower cost. this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content. in addition, new digital distribution channels, such as the internet and online retailers, may present both challenges and opportunities to the company businesses, including its traditional book publishing model, which could affect both sales volume and pricing. the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in order to respond to these new technologies and changes in consumer behavior, and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including distribution of its content on a pay basis, may not be adopted by consumers. the company failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technologies, products and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses, asset values and results of operations. no assurance of profitability of the digital education business. many of the newer lines of amplify, the company digital education business, are still under development. accordingly, amplify prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as digital education. these risks for amplify include, but are not limited to, an evolving business model and the management of growth. amplify must, among other things, develop a customer base for its full range of offerings, including by utilizing the existing customers associated with its data and assessment business, implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy, continue to develop and upgrade its software and content offerings, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. in addition, the results and growth of amplify businesses are dependent on state educational funding, which may be adversely affected by changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, changes in the state procurement process and changes in the condition of the local, state or u.s. economy. future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues that result in a decrease in educational funding and, in turn, adversely affect amplify businesses. there can be no assurance that amplify will be successful in addressing these risks or in achieving these goals, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on amplify business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. since the 2010 acquisition of wireless generation, the former brand of amplify data and analytics business, now amplify insight, and the initiation of the development of the broader business initiatives of amplify, the company has invested cash of approximately $825 million cumulatively through june 30, 2014, which includes $380 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of wireless generation. significant expenses associated with amplify businesses include salaries, employee benefits and other routine overhead associated with product development. 18 table of contents the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company australian operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period. the sports rights contracts between certain of the company australian operating businesses, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. as these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. in addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and could adversely affect its revenues. upon renewal, the company results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company results of operations. the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. since the company financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the company earnings, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial markets may adversely affect the company business. the u.s. and global economies have in the recent past undergone a period of economic uncertainty, which resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit markets, limited access to the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending and lower consumer net worth. the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including advertising revenues. any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company business, reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers, books, television operations and other consumer products. in addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets. as a result, the company results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market. although the company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit markets, including the company revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company may make strategic acquisitions that could introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company may make strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) the risk of diverting the attention of the company senior management from the company operations, (5) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (6) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (7) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with 19 table of contents the acquired business and (8) in some cases, increased regulation. if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with the company existing business, the company business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the company does not have the right to manage foxtel, which means it is not able to cause foxtel to operate or make corporate decisions in a manner that is favorable to the company. the company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of foxtel. while the company rights include the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of foxtel, the company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf, including with regards to declaring and paying dividends. the company faces investigations regarding allegations of voicemail interception, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials and other related matters and related civil lawsuits. u.k. and u.s. regulators and governmental authorities are conducting investigations relating to voicemail interception, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials at the company former publication, the news of the world , and at the sun , and related matters, which are referred to as the u.k. newspaper matters. the investigation by the u.s. department of justice (the doj ) is directed at conduct that occurred within 21st century fox prior to the creation of the company. accordingly, 21st century fox has been and continues to be responsible for responding to the doj investigation. the company, together with 21st century fox, is cooperating with these investigations. civil claims have also been brought against the company with respect to the u.k. newspaper matters. the company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases. the company has also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme established by the company under which parties could pursue claims against it. while additional civil lawsuits may be filed, no additional civil claims may be brought under the compensation scheme after april 8, 2013. in connection with the separation, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that 21st century fox will indemnify the company for payments made after the distribution date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the u.k. newspaper matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees (i) who are not directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, who are not co-defendants with the company or 21st century fox. in addition, violations of law may result in criminal fines or penalties for which the company will not be indemnified by 21st century fox. 21st century fox indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an after-tax basis. from july 1, 2010 through june 30, 2014, the company incurred aggregate fees, costs and expenses related to the u.k. newspaper matters of $470 million, net of costs that have been or will be indemnified by 21st century fox, which includes $36 million paid to claimants for civil settlements. as of june 30, 2014, the company accrued $110 million, representing its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed, as well as incurred but unpaid legal and professional fees. certain liabilities recorded by the company as of june 30, 2014 related to matters that will be indemnified by 21st century fox as described below. amounts due from 21st century fox relating to indemnified costs were approximately $66 million as of june 30, 2014. the company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims or criminal matters. it is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof, including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea, judgment or similar result for which the company will not be indemnified, could damage its reputation, impair the company ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information. 20 table of contents the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company industry and challenging economic and market conditions, the company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill and intangible assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company financial results. in accordance with gaap, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads and distribution networks, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required. any such charge could be material to the company reported results of operations. the news and information services and digital education segments have reporting units with goodwill that is at risk for future impairment. as of june 30, 2014, $1.7 billion of goodwill at these reporting units was at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on its interests. for example, the company australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event; the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and legislation such as the broadcasting services act that regulates ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. for example, current media diversity rules would prevent the company from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. in addition, the company newspaper businesses in the u.k. are likely to be subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, 21 table of contents which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid-2011. the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company former publication, the news of the world . lord justice leveson, chairman of the inquiry, concluded the first part of the inquiry and published a report in late november 2012 containing various recommendations for greater regulation and oversight of the u.k. press. in response, the u.k. government is taking steps to establish a regulatory framework to oversee a new u.k. press regulator. separately, a majority of the u.k. press has proposed an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso, which is expected to be operational by september 2014. ipso will impose burdens on the print media in the u.k., including the company newspaper businesses in the u.k., which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance. newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control. newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company newspaper publishing units. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, the company average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 2.0% lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers, which has led to increases in newsprint prices. failure to maintain the company current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain the company existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future. the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company network management, are important to its business activities. network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the company services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information. in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies network and information systems by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems could result in a disruption of its operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands and a loss of customers or revenues. if any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including personnel, customer and vendor information, the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. efforts by the company and its vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, and any network and information systems-related events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. from time to time the company may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the company revolving credit facility, will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the company access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms 22 table of contents and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the company financial performance, (2) the company credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance, particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating, that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company ability to protect its intellectual property rights. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. the company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, protection of the company intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. there can be no assurance that the company efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy. the company business relies on certain intellectual property and brands. the company businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names. the company believes its proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. any impairment of any such intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company results of operations or financial condition. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company business. in a variety of the company businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox if the separation, together with certain related transactions, were ultimately determined to be taxable transactions for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then the company, 21st century fox and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability, and the company may be required to indemnify 21st century fox for tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox. in connection with the separation, 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of the company class a common stock and class b common stock qualified as tax-free under sections 368 and 355 of the code except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. in addition, 21st century fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the separation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, including the satisfaction of the requirements under sections 368 and 355 of the code not specifically addressed in the irs private letter ruling. the opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. 23 table of contents the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the separation. if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and u.s. stockholders and certain non-u.s. stockholders could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. in addition, if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st century fox would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and/or recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company common stock distributed to 21st century fox stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox tax basis in such shares. as described below, the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation, the company will, in certain circumstances, be responsible for all taxes, including interest and penalties, and tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation. specifically, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, or (3) the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination. the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox. each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group, which, prior to the separation, included 21st century fox, the company and 21st century fox other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the u.s. federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the separation. consequently, the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any member of 21st century fox consolidated group. the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify. the company might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the separation because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the company ability to engage in significant strategic transactions and equity issuances may be limited or restricted after the separation in order to preserve, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution by 21st century fox. even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code, it may result in corporate level taxable gain to 21st century fox under section 355(e) of the code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of the company stock is acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. to preserve the tax-free treatment to 21st century fox of the distribution and the internal transactions in connection with the distribution for u.s. federal income tax purposes, under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company entered into with 21st century fox, the company is prohibited from taking or 24 table of contents failing to take certain actions that may prevent the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes. further, for the two-year period following the separation, without obtaining the consent of 21st century fox, the company may be prohibited from: approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than a specified percentage of the company common stock, a merger, a redemption of equity securities, a sale or other disposition of certain businesses or a specified percentage of the company assets, an acquisition of a business or assets with equity securities to the extent one or more persons would acquire in excess of a specified percentage of the company common stock, or amending the company organizational documents or taking any other action through stockholder vote or otherwise that affects the relative economic or voting rights of the company outstanding stock. these restrictions may limit the company ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of its business. moreover, the tax sharing and indemnification agreement also provides that the company is responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the separation by or in respect of the company or any of its affiliates. the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the u.s. the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks and newspapers (the broadcast ownership rules ) and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest (the program access rules ). under the fcc rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the murdoch family trust ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules. consequently, the company future conduct, including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator, may affect 21st century fox ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules, or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules. therefore, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires, after the distribution date, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the u.s. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business, then the company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. in addition, the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor, including a cable television operator, if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject. this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business. the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements, 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities, and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century 25 table of contents fox for certain liabilities. as a result, the company could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates representations, covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement, tax sharing and indemnification agreement or any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation. the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities. certain agreements that the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may limit its ability to take certain actions with respect to the civil u.k. newspaper matters. under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement, in consideration for 21st century fox agreement to certain indemnification arrangements, the company agreed that 21st century fox would have the right to control the company defense of civil claims relating to the u.k. newspaper matters. in exercising its rights to control the defense of the civil claims relating to the u.k. newspaper matters, 21st century fox may be guided by interests that are different than or adverse to the company interests and the interests of its stockholders and advocate strategies that the company management would not otherwise adopt. furthermore, if the company fails to comply with these control arrangements or does not consent to settlements with respect to such matters proposed by 21st century fox, the company has agreed with 21st century fox that it will, at 21st century fox discretion, forego any indemnification with regard to such or all of these matters. the company inability to take actions with respect to these civil matters without 21st century fox consent or the company adoption of strategies advocated by 21st century fox could damage the company reputation or impair the company ability to conduct its business while the taking of any such action by the company without 21st century fox consent in breach of the company agreements could increase its liability exposure with regard to such matters and adversely affect the company results of operations and financial condition. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information. the company has a limited operating history as an independent, publicly-traded company, and its historical financial statements for certain reporting periods are not necessarily representative of the results it would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company, do not reflect any subsequent changes in its cost structure and may not be reliable indicators of its future results. the company historical financial statements for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2013 and 2012 included in this annual report do not necessarily reflect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that it would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that it will achieve in the future. prior to the separation, the company business was operated by 21st century fox as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. during those periods, 21st century fox performed various corporate functions for the company, including, but not limited to, tax administration, treasury activities, accounting, legal, ethics and compliance program administration, investor and public relations, certain governance functions (including internal audit) and external reporting. the company historical financial statements for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2013 and 2012 reflect allocations of corporate expenses from 21st century fox for these and similar functions. however, these allocations may be more or less than the comparable expenses that the company would have incurred had it operated as an independent, publicly traded company during those periods. in addition, changes have and may continue to occur in the company cost structure, management, financing, business operations, personnel needs, tax and structure as a result of its operation as a public company separate from 21st century fox, including the incurrence of costs for compliance with requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act, sec regulations and nasdaq and asx listing rules and potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale. prior to the separation, the company benefited from 21st century fox operating diversity, size, purchasing power and access to capital for investments, and it may not continue to realize such benefits in the future. as a result, there is a risk that the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while it was still a part of 21st century fox. additionally, in connection with the separation, the company entered into certain transactions with 21st century fox that did not exist prior to the separation. 26 table of contents certain of the company directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox, and certain of the company officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of 21st century fox, which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox. certain of the company directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of 21st century fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company executive chairman and the chairman and chief executive officer of 21st century fox, and gerson zweifach, who serves as the company general counsel and as senior executive vice president and group general counsel of 21st century fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement, the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates. the company restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company restated certificate of incorporation) to 21st century fox instead of the company. as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation, the provisions in the company restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company. risks related to the company common stock the market price of the company stock may fluctuate significantly the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the company quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company operating results; (3) success or failure of the company business strategy; (4) the company ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (12) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (13) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. 27 table of contents certain provisions of the company restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, tax sharing and indemnification agreement, separation and distribution agreement and delaware law, the company amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; stockholders to remove directors only for cause; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; special stockholders meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. in addition, in connection with the separation, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in june 2014. pursuant to the amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the company common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company class b common stock immediately following the separation. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. the rights expire on june 18, 2015, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 8, 2014, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company class b common stock and less than one percent of the company class a common stock as of august 8, 2014. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 8, 2014. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from 28 table of contents making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 73 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. the following sections provide quantitative information on the company exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. foreign currency rates the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. foreign operations. because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years. the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2014 and 2013: u.s. dollars australian dollars british pound sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 revenues 52 % 30 % 18 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 54 % 27 % 19 % fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 revenues 52 % 31 % 17 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 53 % 29 % 18 % based on the year ended june 30, 2014, a one cent change in each of the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling exchange rates will impact revenues by approximately $24 million for each currency on an annual basis, and will impact total segment ebitda by approximately $4 million and $1 million, respectively, on an annual basis. stock prices the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $151 million as of june 30, 2014. a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately $15 million before tax. any changes in fair value of the company common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed other-than-temporary. 73 table of contents credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. the company receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30, 2014 or june 30, 2013 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the company products and services are sold. the company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. as of june 30, 2014, the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. 74 table of contentsrisk factors 17 risk factors. the company also owns a 50% stake in foxtel, the largest pay-tv provider in australia, which is accounted for as an equity

inserts are multiple-page marketing booklets containing coupons, rebates and other consumer offers, which are distributed to consumers through insertion primarily into local sunday publications. nam is one of the two largest publishers of free-standing inserts in the u.s. advertisers, primarily packaged goods companies, pay nam to produce free-standing inserts where their offers are featured,

have key advantages when compared to other marketing options available to packaged goods companies, retailers and other marketers. nam offers cost-effective programs that reach a national audience of engaged consumers who are actively seeking coupons or discounts and who are at a critical moment in their purchase decision. by delivering an immediate incentive or brand message to shoppers as they are making brand decisions, nam believes free-standing inserts and in-store advertising have an advantage over competing forms of mass media such as radio or television. the company news and information services products compete with a wide range of media businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services. the company newspapers, magazines and digital publications compete for readership and advertising with local and national newspapers, web and application-based media, social media sources and other traditional media such as television, magazines, outdoor displays and radio. competition for print and digital subscriptions and circulation is based on the news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness results. as a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the company news and information services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue from a variety of 8 table of contents alternative news and information sources. these include both paid and free websites, digital applications, news aggregators, blogs, search engines, social media platforms, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms. shifts in consumer behavior, including the rapid adoption of mobile phones, tablets, electronic readers and other portable devices as platforms through which news and information is consumed, require the company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. the company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes. dow jones professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global financial newswires, including thomson reuters, bloomberg l.p., lexisnexis, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data. nam competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, including those that provide promotional or advertising inserts, direct mailers of promotional or advertising materials, providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store programs and providers of savings and/or grocery-focused digital applications, as well as other media platforms such as television, magazines, outdoor displays and radio. competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. the company believes that based on the circulation of its free-standing inserts, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the audience for its online programs, nam provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. book publishing the company book publishing segment consists of harpercollins publishers (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, harpercollins ), the second largest consumer book publisher in the world based on global revenue, with operations in 18 countries. harpercollins publishes and distributes consumer books globally through print, digital and audio formats.

generated through the sale of e-books as well as digital audio books, represented approximately 22% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. with the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, harpercollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. for example, through its popular romance imprint, avon, harpercollins launched a digital-first series which releases at least one new title per week in the romance category. harpercollins digital-first series have collectively generated 15 new york times electronic bestsellers since launch. 9 table of contents during fiscal 2015, harpercollins u.s. had 214 titles on the new york times print and digital bestseller lists, with 15 titles hitting

traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including amazon, apple, barnes &amp; noble and tesco. revenues at the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of harpercollins books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the company second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. the book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations, including tablets and electronic readers sold by amazon, apple, google and barnes &amp; noble. harpercollins competes with other large publishers, such as penguin random house, simon &amp; schuster and hachette livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. in addition, harpercollins competes for readership with other media formats and sources. the company believes harpercollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. furthermore, harpercollins is a leader in children and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption. digital real estate services the company digital real estate services segment consists of its 61.6% interest in rea group limited ( rea

aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. the company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and regulations described herein. the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the company interests. australian media regulation the company subscription television interests are subject to australia regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry. the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority. key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions currently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 (cth), subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) the broadcasting services act also may impact the company ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including, for example, preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. u.k. press regulation on july 13, 2011, prime minister david cameron announced a two-part inquiry into the u.k. press and appointed lord justice leveson as chairman of the inquiry. the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company former publication, the news of the world . hearings opened on 14 table of contents november 14, 2011 with respect to the first part of the inquiry, and lord justice leveson published his report on november 29, 2012. the report made recommendations on the future of press regulation and governance in the u.k., which have been the subject of debate in the u.k. parliament, as well as discussion both among newspaper groups (including news uk) and the industry and the government. a date has yet to be set for the second part of the inquiry. in 2013, a royal charter on self-regulation of the press was granted, which established a recognition panel responsible for recognizing, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies. the panel is currently determining how it will receive and approve applications from bodies applying to become a press regulatory body and intends to start accepting applications later in 2015. the new press regulatory body or bodies, a majority of the board members of which would be independent of the industry, would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. the u.k. government also passed legislation which ensures that the royal charter can only be altered by a two-thirds majority of parliament. in addition to the royal charter and establishment of a new regulatory body, legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who do not participate in this new u.k. press regulatory system may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded. in late 2013, publications representing the majority of the industry in the u.k., including news uk, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, which is referred to as the independent press standards organisation, or ipso. since then, ipso has been established and began operating in september 2014. ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the recognition panel. ipso has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. ipso oversees the editors code of practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code and levy fines. ipso is also considering the introduction of an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. ipso imposes burdens on the print media, including the company newspaper businesses in the u.k., which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance. data privacy and security our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve in light of changes in information technology and analytics techniques that have implications for how such data is managed. for example, in the u.s., the company websites, mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children online privacy protection act of 1998, which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent, and the controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act of 2003, which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or spam. the state of california also recently enacted a number of laws relating to data privacy and security, including the digital eraser law, which regulates online advertising to minors. in addition, regulators such as the federal communications commission and the federal trade commission (the ftc ) continue to expand their application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. the ftc also continues to expand its enforcement of the telephone consumer protection act, which regulates text message advertising. many states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security, including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates, including the european union and australia. the european union is currently considering a new privacy regulation that would replace its existing data protection directive and, if adopted in its current proposed form, would expand the regulation of the collection, use and security of personal data, continue to 15 table of contents restrict the trans-border flow of such data, introduce an expanded right of individuals to have their data deleted upon request, enhance penalties for non-compliance and increase the enforcement powers of the european commission. in australia, recent changes in data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers and placing restrictions on direct marketing practices, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. in response to such developments, industry participants in the u.s., europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the company, to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. in the u.s., the council on better business bureaus has begun enforcing the digital advertising alliance self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising with respect to native advertising, requiring real-time notice and an opportunity to opt out in connection with such advertisements. the company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments. education the availability of funding for k-12 education is affected by changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, as well as changes in the state procurement process. future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues and resulting decreases in educational funding that could, in turn, have an adverse impact on the company digital education business. intellectual property the company intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. policing unauthorized use of the company products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company intellectual property. the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their 16 table of contents validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company operations. moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2015, the company had approximately 25,000 employees, of whom approximately 10,000 were located in the u.s., 4,000 were located in the u.k. and 8,000 were located in australia. of the company employees, approximately 8,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating the company and its common stock. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company common stock. the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to the company business, risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox and risks related to the company common stock. risks related to the company business a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, integrated marketing services and digital media properties. the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and pay-tv programming. expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. national and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation all impact demand for advertising. a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the company overall advertising revenue. the company ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company products and services, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. for example, circulation levels for the company newspapers and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates. for the company digital media properties, advertisers use various 17 table of contents metrics to evaluate demand such as the number of visits, number of users, user engagement and, for digital real estate services, the number and quality of leads provided. demand for the company products and services depends in turn upon the company ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner. for example, the company newspapers, cable channels and pay-tv programming must continue to provide high-quality content that is interesting and relevant to users in order to retain and grow their audiences. similarly, the success of the company digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive, current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors, which the company generally obtains through short-term arrangements with mlss, real estate brokers, real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed and/or may be terminated with limited or no notice. in addition, streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet and other devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. these technological and other developments may also cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company offerings to advertisers. furthermore, the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are also playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure. evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, such as viewability, could also adversely affect digital advertising revenues. consequently, the company digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company customers, reduced demand for the company offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company businesses and assets. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content, including both traditional and new content providers. this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues in the company news and information services segment may continue to decline, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers increasing reliance on the internet for the delivery of news and information, often without charge. in recent years, internet sites devoted to recruitment, automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales. in addition, due to innovations in content distribution platforms, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices, in some cases also without charge, which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates television programming and pay-tv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers willingness to purchase television advertising from the company. the company ability to compete effectively depends on many factors both within and beyond its control, including audience acceptance of its high-quality journalism, book titles, television programming and other products. if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 18 table of contents the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render our products and services less valuable. for example, alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet, often without charge, and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internet-delivered content on portable devices and televisions. enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership, which could negatively affect the company revenues. new digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with us, often at a lower cost. this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internet-based products and services. in addition, new digital distribution channels, such as the internet and online retailers, may present both challenges and opportunities to the company businesses, including its traditional book publishing model, which could affect both sales volume and pricing. in order to succeed, the company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers. the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors, and changes in consumer behavior, and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including distribution of its content on a pay basis, may not be adopted by consumers. the company failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technologies, products, services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses, asset values and results of operations. the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company australian operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period. the sports rights contracts between certain of the company australian operating businesses, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. as these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. in addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and could adversely affect its revenues. upon renewal, the company results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company results of operations. the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. since the company financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the company earnings, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. 19 table of contents weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company business. the u.s. and global economies have undergone economic uncertainty in the past, which resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit markets, limited access to the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market. the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including advertising revenues. any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company business, reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers, books, digital real estate services business, television operations and other consumer products and services. in addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets. as a result, the company results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market. although the company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit markets, including the company revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions that introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) the risk of diverting the attention of the company senior management from the company operations, (5) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (6) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (7) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business and (8) in some cases, increased regulation. if any acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with the company existing business, the company business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and the company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets. the company does not have the right to manage foxtel, which means it is not able to cause foxtel to operate or make corporate decisions in a manner that is favorable to the company. the company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of foxtel. while the company rights include the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of foxtel, the company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf, including with regards to declaring and paying dividends. 20 table of contents the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company network management, are important to its business activities. network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the company services and/or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies network and information systems, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. the company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the company to date. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems could result in a disruption of its operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations, lawsuits, a loss of customers or revenues and other financial losses. if any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the company business, including its intellectual property, the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. efforts by the company and its vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. the company faces investigations regarding allegations of voicemail interception, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials and other related matters and related civil lawsuits. governmental authorities in the u.k. are conducting investigations relating to voicemail interception, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials at the company former publication, the news of the world , and at the sun , and related matters, which are referred to as the u.k. newspaper matters. the company is cooperating with these investigations. civil claims have also been brought against the company with respect to the u.k. newspaper matters. the company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases. the company has also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme established by the company under which parties could pursue claims against it. while additional civil lawsuits may be filed, no additional civil claims may be brought under the compensation scheme after april 8, 2013. in connection with the separation, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that 21st century fox will indemnify the company for payments made after the distribution date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the u.k. newspaper matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees (1) who are not directors, officers or certain designated employees or (2) with respect to civil matters, who are not co-defendants with the company or 21st century fox. in addition, violations of law may result in criminal fines or penalties for which the company will not be indemnified by 21st century fox. 21st century fox indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an after-tax basis. 21 table of contents from july 1, 2010 through june 30, 2015, the company incurred aggregate fees, costs and expenses related to the u.k. newspaper matters of $520 million, net of costs that have been or will be indemnified by 21st century fox, which includes $39 million paid to claimants for civil settlements. as of june 30, 2015, the company accrued $125 million, representing its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed, including liabilities associated with employment taxes, as well as incurred but unpaid legal and professional fees. certain liabilities recorded by the company as of june 30, 2015 related to matters that will be indemnified by 21st century fox as described above. amounts due from 21st century fox relating to indemnified costs were approximately $63 million as of june 30, 2015. the company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims or criminal matters. it is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof, including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea, judgment or similar result for which the company will not be indemnified, could damage its reputation, impair the company ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information. the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company industry and challenging economic and market conditions, the company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill and intangible assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company financial results. when the company acquires a business, it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, as of the acquisition date. the company management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment. in accordance with gaap, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads and distribution networks, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required. any such charge could be material to the company reported results of operations. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as part of its long-range planning process the company changed its strategy and related outlook with respect to its amplify reporting unit, which resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows. consequently, the company determined that the fair value of the amplify reporting unit had declined below its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of $371 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on its interests. 22 table of contents for example, the company australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event; the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and other parts of the broadcasting services act that regulate ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. for example, current media diversity rules would prevent the company from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. in addition, the company newspaper businesses in the u.k. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid-2011. the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company former publication, the news of the world . lord justice leveson, chairman of the inquiry, concluded the first part of the inquiry and published a report in late november 2012 containing various recommendations for greater regulation and oversight of the u.k. press. the u.k. government subsequently published a royal charter on self-regulation of the press which established a recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press self-regulatory body. no such regulator has yet been approved by the recognition panel. however, a majority of the u.k. press has established an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso, which began operating in september 2014. ipso imposes burdens on the print media in the u.k., including the company newspaper businesses in the u.k., which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance. the company business activities are also subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve in light of changes in information technology and analytics techniques that have implications for how such data is managed. see governmental regulation data privacy and security for more information. these laws and regulations could be costly to comply with, subject the company to claims and other remedies and limit or restrict aspects of the company business, including, for example, by restricting the use of personal and profiling data to deliver targeted advertisements. adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company business practices and operating results. from time to time, the company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. for example, certain competitors and customers of the company nam business have filed lawsuits against nam alleging antitrust violations and seeking treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. on june 18, 2015, class action certification was granted in the action brought by customers of the nam business, and on july 2, 2015, nam petitioned for leave to appeal, 23 table of contents which plaintiffs have opposed. the outcome of litigation or other proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect the company results of operations or financial condition as well as the company ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. in addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. see note 14 to the financial statements for more information. newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control. newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company newspaper publishing units. during the three months ended june 30, 2015, the company average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 13% lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers, which has led to increases in newsprint prices. failure to maintain the company current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain the company existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future. the company international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. in its fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, approximately 56% of the company revenues were derived outside the u.s., and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainty and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (4) complying with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions; (5) complying with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act; (6) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; and (7) complying with local labor laws and regulations. events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. from time to time the company may need or desire to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the company revolving credit facility, will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the company access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the company financial performance, (2) the company credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance, particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating, that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company ability to protect its intellectual property rights. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. developments in technology increase the threat of 24 table of contents content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. the company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, protection of the company intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. there can be no assurance that the company efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy. the company business relies on certain intellectual property and brands. the company businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names. the company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. however, the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties. any failure by the company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company results of operations or financial condition. in addition, the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims. no assurance of profitability of the digital education business. some of the newer lines of amplify, the company digital education business, are still under development. accordingly, amplify prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as digital education. these risks for amplify include, but are not limited to, an evolving business model and the management of growth. amplify must, among other things, develop a customer base for its full range of offerings, including by utilizing the existing customers associated with its data and assessment business, implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy, continue to develop and upgrade its software and content offerings, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. in addition, the results and growth of amplify businesses are dependent on state educational funding, which may be adversely affected by changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, changes in the state procurement process and changes in the condition of the local, state or u.s. economy. future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues that result in a decrease in educational funding and, in turn, adversely affect amplify businesses. there can be no assurance that amplify will be successful in addressing these risks or in achieving these goals, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on amplify business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. the company relationship with nar is an important part of its digital real estate services business in the u.s. and this business could be harmed if it were to lose the benefits of this relationship move, the company digital real estate services business in the u.s., licenses the realtor.com &reg; trademark and website address, as well as the realtor &reg; trademark, from nar pursuant to a trademark license agreement (the nar license ). move also operates the realtor.com &reg; website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration. however, nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. if the operating agreement with nar is terminated, the nar license would also terminate, and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com &reg; website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. nar would then be able to operate a realtor.com &reg; website, either by itself or with another third party. 25 table of contents in addition to the contractual limitations and risks described above, any adverse developments in move business relationship with nar as a result of existing or new areas of conflict or potential conflict between move interests and nar interests, changes in the real estate industry or other causes could also adversely affect move business, particularly as many of its customers and data providers are members of, have interests that are closely aligned with, or are otherwise influenced by, nar. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company business. in a variety of the company businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox if the separation, together with certain related transactions, were ultimately determined to be taxable transactions for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then the company, 21st century fox and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability, and the company may be required to indemnify 21st century fox for tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox. in connection with the separation, 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of the company class a common stock and class b common stock qualified as tax-free under sections 368 and 355 of the code except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. in addition, 21st century fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the separation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, including the satisfaction of the requirements under sections 368 and 355 of the code not specifically addressed in the irs private letter ruling. the opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons. if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and u.s. stockholders and certain non-u.s. stockholders could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. in addition, if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st century fox would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and/or recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company common stock distributed to 21st century fox stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox tax basis in such shares. as described below, the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation, the company will, in certain circumstances, be responsible for all taxes, including interest and penalties, and tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation. specifically, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant 26 table of contents made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, or (3) the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination. the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox. each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group, which, prior to the separation, included 21st century fox, the company and 21st century fox other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the u.s. federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the separation. consequently, the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any member of 21st century fox consolidated group. the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify. the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the u.s. the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks and newspapers (the broadcast ownership rules ) and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest (the program access rules ). under the fcc rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the murdoch family trust ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules. consequently, the company future conduct, including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator, may affect 21st century fox ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules, or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules. therefore, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires, after the distribution date, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the u.s. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business, then the company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. in addition, the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor, including a cable television operator, if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject. this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business. the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements, 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities, and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century fox for certain liabilities. as a result, the company could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates representations, covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement, tax sharing and indemnification agreement or 27 table of contents any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation. the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities. certain agreements that the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may limit its ability to take certain actions with respect to the civil u.k. newspaper matters. under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement, in consideration for 21st century fox agreement to certain indemnification arrangements, the company agreed that 21st century fox would have the right to control the company defense of civil claims relating to the u.k. newspaper matters. in exercising its rights to control the defense of the civil claims relating to the u.k. newspaper matters, 21st century fox may be guided by interests that are different than or adverse to the company interests and the interests of its stockholders and advocate strategies that the company management would not otherwise adopt. furthermore, if the company fails to comply with these control arrangements or does not consent to settlements with respect to such matters proposed by 21st century fox, the company has agreed with 21st century fox that it will, at 21st century fox discretion, forego any indemnification with regard to such or all of these matters. the company inability to take actions with respect to these civil matters without 21st century fox consent or the company adoption of strategies advocated by 21st century fox could damage the company reputation or impair the company ability to conduct its business while the taking of any such action by the company without 21st century fox consent in breach of the company agreements could increase its liability exposure with regard to such matters and adversely affect the company results of operations and financial condition. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information. the company has a limited operating history as an independent, publicly-traded company, and its historical financial statements for certain reporting periods are not necessarily representative of the results it would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company, do not reflect any subsequent changes in its cost structure and may not be reliable indicators of its future results. certain of the company historical financial statements do not necessarily reflect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that it would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company during the applicable period or those that it will achieve in the future. prior to the separation, the company business was operated by 21st century fox as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. during those periods, 21st century fox performed various corporate functions for the company, including, but not limited to, tax administration, treasury activities, accounting, legal, ethics and compliance program administration, investor and public relations, certain governance functions (including internal audit) and external reporting. certain of the company historical financial statements reflect allocations of corporate expenses from 21st century fox for these and similar functions. however, these allocations may be more or less than the comparable expenses that the company would have incurred had it operated as an independent, publicly traded company during those periods. in addition, changes have occurred and may continue to occur in the company cost structure, management, financing, business operations, personnel needs, tax and structure as a result of its operation as a public company separate from 21st century fox, including the incurrence of costs for compliance with requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act, sec regulations and nasdaq and asx listing rules and potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale. prior to the separation, the company benefited from 21st century fox operating diversity, size, purchasing power and access to capital for investments, and it may not continue to realize such benefits in the future. as a result, there is a risk that the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while it was still a part of 21st century fox. additionally, in connection with the separation, the company entered into certain transactions with 21st century fox that did not exist prior to the separation. 28 table of contents certain of the company directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox, and certain of the company officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of 21st century fox, which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox. certain of the company directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of 21st century fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox, and lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as the company co-chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement, the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates. the company restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company restated certificate of incorporation) to 21st century fox instead of the company. as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation, the provisions in the company restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company. risks related to the company common stock the market price of the company stock may fluctuate significantly the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the company quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company operating results; (3) success or failure of the company business strategy; (4) the company ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (12) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (13) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. 29 table of contents certain provisions of the company restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, tax sharing and indemnification agreement, separation and distribution agreement and delaware law, the company second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; stockholders to remove directors only for cause; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; special stockholders meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. in addition, in connection with the separation, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in june 2014 and again in june 2015. pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the company common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company class b common stock immediately following the separation. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. the rights expire on june 18, 2018, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 6, 2015, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company class b common stock and less than one percent of the company class a common stock as of august 6, 2015. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 6, 2015. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of 30 table of contents the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 77 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. the following sections provide quantitative information on the company exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. foreign currency rates the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. foreign operations. because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years. the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2015 and 2014: u.s. dollars australian dollars british pound sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 revenues 44 % 30 % 21 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 48 % 28 % 24 % fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 revenues 41 % 31 % 22 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 45 % 30 % 25 % based on the year ended june 30, 2015, a one cent change in each of the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $31 million and $12 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately $6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, on an annual basis. stock prices the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $185 million as of june 30, 2015. a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately $19 million before tax. any changes in fair value of the company common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed other-than-temporary. 77 table of contents credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. the company receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30, 2015 or june 30, 2014 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the company products and services are sold. the company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. as of june 30, 2015, the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. 78 table of contentsrisk factors 16 risk factors. the company also owns a 50% stake in foxtel, the largest pay-tv provider in australia, which is accounted for as an equity investment. the company maintains a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on

compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and 13 table of contents regulations described herein. the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the company interests. australian media regulation the company subscription television interests are subject to australia regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry. the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority. key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions currently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 (cth), subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) the broadcasting services act also may impact the company ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including, for example, preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. data privacy and security our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. for example, in the u.s., certain of the company websites, mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children online privacy protection act of 1998, which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. in addition, the federal trade commission (the ftc ) continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. most states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security, including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates, including the european union and australia. recently, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive (directive 95/46/ec). fully enforceable by may 25, 2018, the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, increases penalties for non-compliance and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. also, in 2015, the european court of justice invalidated the u.s.-e.u. safe harbor framework, one of the legal mechanisms through which personal data could be transferred from the european union to the united states, and the mechanism relied upon by the company with respect to certain personal data transfers among the company businesses, and between the company and some of its third party service providers. the company has been putting into place, and working with its third party service providers to implement, alternative legal mechanisms for cross-border personal data transfers. in australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers and placing restrictions on direct marketing practices, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. 14 table of contents in response to such developments, industry participants in the u.s., europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the company data privacy and security compliance programs. u.k. press regulation as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid-2011, a royal charter on self-regulation of the press was granted in 2013, which established a recognition panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies. once approved by the recognition panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. no such regulator has yet been approved by the recognition panel, although it is currently considering an application by a newly-formed independent body, impress. in addition to the royal charter and establishment of the new recognition panel, legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who do not participate in this new u.k. press regulatory system may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded. in late 2013, publications representing the majority of the industry in the u.k., including news uk, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, which is referred to as the independent press standards organisation, or ipso. ipso, which began operating in september 2014, currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the recognition panel. ipso has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. ipso oversees the editors code of practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors code and levy fines of up to &pound;1 million. ipso is also considering the introduction of an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. ipso imposes burdens on the print media, including the company newspaper businesses in the u.k., which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance intellectual property the company intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. policing unauthorized use of the company products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company intellectual property. the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and 15 table of contents international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company operations. moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2016, the company had approximately 24,000 employees, of whom approximately 9,000 were located in the u.s., 4,000 were located in the u.k. and 8,000 were located in australia. of the company employees, approximately 5,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating the company and its common stock. any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the company business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company common stock. the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to the company business, risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox and risks related to the company common stock. risks related to the company business a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, integrated marketing services and digital media properties. the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and pay-tv programming. expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. national and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation all impact demand for advertising. a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the company overall advertising revenue. 16 table of contents the company ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company products and services, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. for example, circulation levels for the company newspapers and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates. for the company digital media properties, advertisers use various metrics to evaluate demand such as the number of visits, number of users, user engagement and, for digital real estate services, the number and quality of leads provided. demand for the company products and services depends in turn upon the company ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner. technological and other developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company offerings to advertisers. the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional print to digital. the development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. in addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. as a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure. consequently, the company digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure. new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. in addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, including the industry-wide standard on viewability, as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. as the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the company ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage digital audiences and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings. while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its print and digital platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company customers, reduced demand for the company offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company businesses and assets. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content, including both traditional and new content providers. this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues in the company news and information services segment may continue to decline, reflecting general 17 table of contents trends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers increasing reliance on a variety of content providers, including news aggregation websites and customized news feeds, for the delivery of news and information through the internet, often without charge. internet sites and mobile applications devoted to recruitment, automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales. in addition, due to innovations in content distribution platforms, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices, in some cases also without charge, which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates television programming and pay-tv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers willingness to purchase television advertising from the company. the company ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. for example, the company relies on audience acceptance of the high-quality content in its newspapers, book titles, cable channels and pay-tv programming in order to retain and grow their audiences. similarly, the success of the company digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive, current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors, which the company generally obtains through short-term arrangements with mlss, real estate brokers, real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed and/or may be terminated with limited or no notice. online traffic is also driven by internet search results, and any failure to successfully manage and adapt to changes in search engine optimization across the company businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to our digital properties, lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic. some of the company current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does, which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions. if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company products and services less valuable. for example, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet, often without charge, and consumers are able to view such internet-delivered content on portable devices and televisions. enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership, which could negatively affect the company revenues. other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with us, often at a lower cost. this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internet-based products and services. additional digital distribution channels, such as the internet and online retailers, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the company businesses, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing. 18 table of contents in order to succeed, the company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers. the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors, and changes in consumer behavior, and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including distribution of its content on a pay basis, may not be adopted by consumers. the company failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technologies, products, services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses, asset values and results of operations. the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company australian operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period, and programming costs could also increase upon renewal. the sports rights contracts between certain of the company australian operating businesses, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. as these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. in addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and lead to customer dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. upon renewal, the company results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company results of operations. the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. since the company financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the company earnings, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company business. the u.s. and global economies have undergone periods of economic uncertainty which resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit markets, limited access to the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market. the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including advertising revenues. any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company business, reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers, books, digital real estate services business, television operations and other consumer products and services. in addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets. as a result, the company results of operations may 19 table of contents be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market. the company also has significant operations in the u.k., which recently voted in a referendum to leave the european union. while the referendum is advisory, the u.k. government has stated that it intends to give effect to the results of the vote. an exit of the u.k. from the european union could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary and regulatory landscape in the u.k., lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union, result in additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company businesses in the u.k. and elsewhere. although the company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit markets, including the company revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the company senior management from the company operations, (6) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (7) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (8) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business or investment and (9) in some cases, increased regulation. if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company existing businesses, the company business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and the company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets. the company does not have the right to manage foxtel, which means it is not able to cause foxtel to operate or make corporate decisions in a manner that is favorable to the company. the company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of foxtel. while the company rights include the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of foxtel, the company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf, including with regards to declaring and paying dividends. the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company network management, are important to its business activities. the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and cloud-based systems and services that support a variety of business operations. network and information systems-related events affecting the company systems, or those of third parties upon which the company business relies, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, human error or malfeasance that may affect such 20 table of contents systems, could result in disruption of the company business and/or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. in addition, hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties may contain design or manufacturing defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. the company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the company to date. efforts by the company and its vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. while the company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our system. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers or revenues and other financial losses. if any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the company business, including its intellectual property, the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company industry and challenging economic and market conditions, the company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company financial results. when the company acquires a business, it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, as of the acquisition date. the company management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment. in accordance with gaap, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including distribution networks, newspaper mastheads, imprints and trademarks, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required. any such charge could be material to the company reported results of operations. the news and information services and cable network programming segments have reporting units with goodwill that is at risk for future impairment. as of june 30, 2016, nearly $1.0 billion of goodwill at these reporting units was at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. 21 table of contents the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on its interests. for example, the company australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event; the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and other parts of the broadcasting services act that regulate ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. for example, current media diversity rules would prevent the company from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. the company business activities are also subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. these laws and regulations could be costly to comply with, limit or restrict aspects of the company business, including, for example, by restricting the use of personal and profiling data to deliver targeted advertisements, and subject the company to claims and other remedies. for example, the european union recently adopted the gdpr, which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. see governmental regulation data privacy and security for more information. in addition, the company newspaper businesses in the u.k. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid-2011. the u.k. government subsequently published a royal charter on self-regulation of the press which established a recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press self-regulatory body. no such regulator has yet been approved by the recognition panel, although it is currently considering an application by a newly-formed independent body, impress. in the meantime, a majority of the u.k. press has established an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso, which began operating in september 2014. ipso, which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the recognition panel, has powers to impose burdens on the print media in the u.k., including the company u.k.-based newspaper businesses. these powers, which include the ability to impose fines of up to &pound;1 million for breaches of ipso editor code of practice, may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance. 22 table of contents adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company business practices and operating results. from time to time, the company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. for example, a competitor of the company nam business has filed lawsuits against nam alleging antitrust violations and seeking treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company results of operations or financial condition as well as the company ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. for example, in february 2016, as part of a settlement agreement relating to an action brought by customers of the nam business, the company agreed, subject to district court approval, to pay the plaintiffs and their attorneys approximately $250 million and settled related claims for approximately $30 million. in addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 15 to the financial statements for more information. newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control. newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company newspaper publishing units. during the three months ended june 30, 2016, the company average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 16% lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years on a constant currency basis. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers, which has led to increases in newsprint prices. failure to maintain the company current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain the company existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future. the company international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. in its fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, approximately 54% of the company revenues were derived outside the u.s., and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainty and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (4) complying with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements; (5) complying with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act; (6) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; and (7) complying with local labor laws and regulations. events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. from time to time the company may need or desire to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the company revolving credit facility, will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the company access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the company financial performance, (2) the company credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance, particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating, that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. 23 table of contents technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company ability to protect its intellectual property rights. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. the company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, protection of the company intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. there can be no assurance that the company efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy. the company business relies on certain intellectual property and brands. the company businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names. the company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. however, the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties. any failure by the company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company results of operations or financial condition. in addition, the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims. the company relationship with nar is an important part of its digital real estate services business in the u.s. and this business could be harmed if it were to lose the benefits of this relationship . move, the company digital real estate services business in the u.s., licenses the realtor.com &reg; trademark and website address, as well as the realtor &reg; trademark, from nar pursuant to a trademark license agreement (the nar license ). move also operates the realtor.com &reg; website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration. however, nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. if the operating agreement with nar is terminated, the nar license would also terminate, and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com &reg; website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. nar would then be able to operate a realtor.com &reg; website, either by itself or with another third party. in addition to the contractual limitations and risks described above, any adverse developments in move business relationship with nar as a result of existing or new areas of conflict or potential conflict between move interests and nar interests, changes in the real estate industry or other causes could also adversely affect move business, particularly as many of its customers and data providers are members of, have interests that are closely aligned with, or are otherwise influenced by, nar. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company business. in a variety of the company businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. 24 table of contents risks related to the company separation from 21st century fox if the separation, together with certain related transactions, were ultimately determined to be taxable transactions for u.s. federal and/or other jurisdictions income tax purposes, then the company, 21st century fox and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability, and the company may be required to indemnify 21st century fox for tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox. in connection with the separation, 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service ( irs ) to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of the company class a common stock and class b common stock qualified as tax-free under sections 368 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ) except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. in addition, 21st century fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the separation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, including the satisfaction of the requirements under sections 368 and 355 of the code not specifically addressed in the irs private letter ruling. the opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs and/or other tax authorities could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons. if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and u.s. stockholders and certain non-u.s. stockholders could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. in addition, if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st century fox and/or the company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st century fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company common stock distributed to 21st century fox stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox tax basis in such shares. as described below, the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation, the company will, in certain circumstances, be responsible for all taxes, including interest and penalties, and tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation. specifically, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, or (3) the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination. the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox. each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group, which, prior to the separation, included 21st century fox, the company and 21st century fox other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the u.s. federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the separation. consequently, the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any member of 21st century fox consolidated group. the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify. 25 table of contents the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the u.s. the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks and newspapers (the broadcast ownership rules ) and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest (the program access rules ). under the fcc rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the murdoch family trust ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules. consequently, the company future conduct, including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator, may affect 21st century fox ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules, or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules. therefore, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires, after the distribution date, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the u.s. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business, then the company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. in addition, the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor, including a cable television operator, if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject. this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business. the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements, 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities, and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century fox for certain liabilities. as a result, the company could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates representations, covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement, tax sharing and indemnification agreement or any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation. the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities. certain of the company directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox, and certain of the company officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of 21st century fox, which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox. certain of the company directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of 21st century fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox, and lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as the company co-chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could 26 table of contents arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement, the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates. the company restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company restated certificate of incorporation) to 21st century fox instead of the company. as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation, the provisions in the company restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company. risks related to the company common stock the market price of the company stock may fluctuate significantly. the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the company quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company operating results; (3) success or failure of the company business strategy; (4) the company ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (12) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (13) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. certain provisions of the company restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, tax sharing and indemnification agreement, separation and distribution agreement and delaware law, the company second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; 27 table of contents special stockholders meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. in addition, in connection with the separation, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in june 2014 and again in june 2015. pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the company common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company class b common stock immediately following the separation. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. the rights expire on june 18, 2018, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 5, 2016, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company class b common stock and less than one percent of the company class a common stock as of august 5, 2016. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 5, 2016. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 74 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. the following sections provide quantitative information on the company exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. foreign currency rates the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. foreign operations. because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years. the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2016 and 2015: u.s. dollars australian dollars british pound sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 revenues 47 % 28 % 20 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 48 % 24 % 21 % fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 revenues 43 % 30 % 21 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 43 % 27 % 23 % based on the year ended june 30, 2016, a one cent change in each of the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $32 million and $11 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately $7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, on an annual basis. stock prices the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $189 million as of june 30, 2016. a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately $19 million before tax. any changes in fair value of the company common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed other-than-temporary. 74 table of contents credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. the company receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30, 2016 or june 30, 2015 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the company products and services are sold. the company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. as of june 30, 2016, the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. 75 table of contentsrisk factors 17 risk factors in this annual report. the company does not ordinarily make projections of its future operating results and undertakes no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of

subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the company interests. australian media regulation the company subscription television interests are subject to australia regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry. the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority. 13 table of contents key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions currently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 (cth), subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) the broadcasting services act also may impact the company ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including, for example, preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. data privacy and security our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. for example, in the u.s., certain of the company websites, mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children online privacy protection act of 1998, which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. in addition, the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. most states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security, including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates, including the european union and australia. for example, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive (directive 95/46/ec). fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25, 2018, the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increases penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million euros, or approximately 23 million u.s. dollars, or 4% of an entity worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication (e-privacy) directive to, among other things, amend the current directive rules on the use of cookies. in 2015, the european court of justice invalidated the u.s.-e.u. safe harbor framework, one of the legal mechanisms through which personal data could be transferred from the european union to the united states, and the mechanism relied upon by the company with respect to certain personal data transfers among the company businesses, and between the company and some of its third party service providers. in 2016, the european commission adopted a new transfer mechanism between the u.s. and the e.u. called the privacy shield. the company has not certified to, and does not rely on, the privacy shield framework for data transfers among the company businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms. however, certain of the company service providers do rely on the privacy shield. the privacy shield is subject to significant uncertainty, including an annual review procedure by u.s. and e.u. authorities, that could affect the company or its service providers obligations thereunder. the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data, including the european union standard 14 table of contents model contractual clauses, are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms, and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted, could cause the company to incur additional costs, require us to change business practices or affect the manner in which we provide our services. in australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. industry participants in the u.s., europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the united states and internationally. the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the company data privacy and security compliance programs. u.k. press regulation as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, which was established by former prime minister david cameron in mid-2011, a royal charter on self-regulation of the press was granted in 2013, which established a press recognition panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies. once approved by the press recognition panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. in addition to the royal charter and establishment of the new press recognition panel, legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. in late 2013, publications representing the majority of the industry in the u.k., including news uk, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso. ipso, which began operating in september 2014, currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel. ipso has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. ipso oversees the editors code of practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors code of practice and levy fines of up to &pound;1 million. ipso has also introduced a pilot arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. the burdens ipso imposes on the print media, including the company newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. u.k. radio broadcasting regulation the company radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant 15 table of contents authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. intellectual property the company intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. policing unauthorized use of the company products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company intellectual property. the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company operations. moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2017, the company had approximately 26,000 employees, of whom approximately 9,000 were located in the u.s., 4,000 were located in the u.k. and 9,000 were located in australia. of the company employees, approximately 5,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. 16 table of contents item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating the company and its common stock. any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the company business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company common stock. a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, integrated marketing services, digital media properties and radio stations. the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and pay-tv programming. expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic and business conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. national and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified advertising revenue. changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation, as well as federal, state and local election cycles, all impact demand for advertising. certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. some of these sectors, such as retail, are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition. a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the company overall advertising revenue. the company ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company products and services, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. for example, circulation levels for the company newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates. for the company digital media properties, including its digital real estate sites, advertisers use various metrics to evaluate consumer demand such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. demand for the company products and services depends in turn upon the company ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner. technological and other developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company offerings to advertisers. the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional print to digital, and the company print advertising revenues have declined in each of its last three fiscal years. the development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. in addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. as a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure. consequently, the company digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic 17 table of contents buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure. new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. in addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, including the industry-wide standard on viewability, as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block, change the location of, or obscure, the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices and/or block or delete cookies, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. as the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the company ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, derive better demographic and other information about its users, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded content, and video and mobile advertising, and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings. while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company customers, reduced demand for the company offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company businesses and assets, results of operations and financial condition. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content, including both traditional and new content providers. this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues in the company news and information services segment may continue to decline, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers increasing reliance on a variety of content providers, including news aggregation websites, social media platforms and customized news feeds, for the delivery of news and information through the internet, often without charge. internet sites and mobile applications devoted to recruitment, automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales. in addition, due to innovations in content distribution platforms, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices, in some cases also without charge, which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates television programming and pay-tv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers willingness to purchase television advertising from the company. the company ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. for example, the company relies on audience acceptance of the high-quality differentiated content in its newspapers, book titles, cable channels, pay-tv programming and radio stations in order to retain and grow their audiences. similarly, the success of the company digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive, current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors, which the company generally obtains through short-term arrangements with mlss, real estate brokers, real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed and/or may be terminated with limited or no notice. however, when faced with a multitude of media choices, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume content than they do on the source, quality or reliability of such content. online traffic is also driven by internet search results, which are based on algorithms that may, among other things, de-prioritize the company paid content. any failure to 18 table of contents successfully manage, and adapt to changes in, search engine optimization across the company businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to our digital properties, lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic or otherwise adversely affect the company business. some of the company current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does, which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions. if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company products and services less valuable. for example, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, often without charge, digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content. enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the company newspapers, television programs and other products, and if the company is unable to introduce engaging, useful and reliable new products tailored for, and available across, these new devices and platforms, including mobile, the company revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with us, often at a lower cost. this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internet-based products and services. additional digital distribution channels, such as the internet and online retailers, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the company businesses, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing. in order to succeed, the company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers. the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior, and to attract and retain employees with the skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate its digital businesses, and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including distribution of its content on a pay basis, may not be adopted by consumers. the company failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, products, services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base or its advertisers to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses, asset values, financial condition and results of operations. the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period, and programming costs could also increase upon renewal. the sports rights contracts between certain of the company operating businesses, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. as these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders 19 table of contents for the rights contracts. in addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and its affiliates and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers or audiences, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. upon renewal, the company results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company results of operations. the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. since the company financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the company earnings, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. in particular, the british pound sterling experienced a significant weakening against the u.s. dollar following the u.k. june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the u.k. exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. this weakness caused the local currency results of the company u.k. operations to be translated into fewer u.s. dollars, which adversely affected our reported results. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the british pound sterling resulted in a decrease in reported revenues at our u.k. newspapers of approximately $177 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year. exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to recent political uncertainty in the u.k. and the negotiation of its exit from the european union. weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company business. the u.s. and global economies have undergone, and continue to experience, periods of economic and market uncertainty, including following brexit and the most recent u.s. presidential election. these conditions have in the past resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit markets, limited access to the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market. the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including advertising revenues. any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company business, reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers, books, digital real estate services business, television operations, radio stations and other consumer products and services. in addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 29% of its fiscal 2017 revenues from australia. as a result, the company results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market. the company also generated approximately 19% of its fiscal 2017 revenues from the u.k., which is experiencing a period of economic and market uncertainty as a result of brexit. while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict, it could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary and regulatory landscape, lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union, result in additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an 20 table of contents adverse impact on the company businesses in the u.k. and elsewhere. although the company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit markets, including the company revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the company senior management from the company operations, (6) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (7) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (8) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business or investment, (9) in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (10) liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments and (11) in some cases, increased regulation. if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company existing businesses, the company business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets. the company does not have the right to manage foxtel, which means it is not able to cause foxtel to operate or make corporate decisions in a manner that is favorable to the company. the company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of foxtel. while the company rights include the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of foxtel, the company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf, including with regards to declaring and paying dividends. the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue or other harm to our business. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company network management, are important to its business activities. the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and cloud-based systems and services that support a variety of business operations. network and information systems-related events affecting the company systems, or those of third parties upon which the company business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the company business and/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. in addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper 21 table of contents implementation of, hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security. in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the company digital businesses expand. the company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the company to date, individually or in the aggregate. while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. while the company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, audience, advertisers or revenues and other financial losses. if any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the company business, including its intellectual property, the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. in addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which the company business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business. the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company industry and challenging economic and market conditions, the company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company financial results. when the company acquires a business, it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, as of the acquisition date. the company management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment. in accordance with gaap, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads, distribution networks, publishing imprints, radio broadcast licenses, trademarks and trade names, channel distribution agreements, publishing rights and customer relationships, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. any downward revisions in the fair value 22 table of contents of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required. any such charge could be material to the company reported results of operations. for example, in fiscal 2017, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $785 million, primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets at its u.k. and australian newspapers, and a $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its investment in foxtel to fair value. in addition, as of june 30, 2017, the company had approximately $1.4 billion of goodwill and $1.2 billion of investments that are at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the corresponding reporting units and investments exceeded their carrying values by less than 3%. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. in addition, laws and regulations in some international jurisdictions differ from those in the united states, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply. the company australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event; the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and other parts of the broadcasting services act that regulate ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. for example, current media diversity rules would prevent the company from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. the company business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have implications for how such data is managed. complying with these laws and regulations could be costly, require us to change our business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the company business in a manner adverse to our business operations. many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. the company failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, could result in exposure to enforcement by u.s. federal or state or foreign governments or private actors, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. an example of such a law is the european union 23 table of contents recently adopted gdpr, which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. see governmental regulation data privacy and security for more information. finally, because some of our products and services are available on the internet, we may be subject to laws or regulations exposing us to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence. in addition, the company newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k. are now subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, which was established by former prime minister david cameron in mid-2011. the u.k. government subsequently published a royal charter on self-regulation of the press which established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body. publishers who are not members of an approved regulator, including the company, may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. the majority of the u.k. press, including news uk, has established an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso, which began operating in september 2014. ipso, which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel, has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the u.k. these powers, which include the ability to impose fines of up to &pound;1 million for systemic breaches of ipso editor code of practice, may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. depending on the political environment, the second phase of the leveson inquiry may be commenced, investigating the relationship between the press and the police. the company radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company business practices and operating results. from time to time, the company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property and other matters. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters. the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company results of operations or financial condition as well as the company ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. for example, in february 2016, the company entered into a settlement agreement relating to an action brought by customers of the nam business pursuant to which it subsequently paid the plaintiffs and their attorneys approximately $250 million; the company also settled related claims for approximately $30 million. in addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. the company is subject to taxation in u.s. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-u.s. jurisdictions, including australia and the u.k. the company effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly 24 table of contents from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the company profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company deferred tax assets. evaluating and estimating the company tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the company tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in our tax returns or positions taken by the company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company. although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. as a result, the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could affect its operating results and financial condition. in connection with the separation, 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service ( irs ) and an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the separation for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st century fox and/or the company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st century fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company common stock distributed to 21st century fox stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox tax basis in such shares. the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. specifically, under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, or (3) the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination. in addition, other tax authorities could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganizations should be treated as taxable transactions resulting in additional tax liabilities. recently, the u.s. government has indicated that corporate tax reform is a high priority and has proposed sweeping changes to the u.s. tax system. these reforms may include changes to corporate tax rates, changes in the taxation of income earned outside the united states and taxing previously unremitted foreign earnings at concessional tax rates. we cannot determine whether some or all of these or other proposals will be enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such proposals prior to being enacted into law. if u.s. tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligations, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 25 table of contents the company international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. in its fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, approximately 54% of the company revenues were derived outside the u.s., and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (4) compliance with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements; (5) compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act; (6) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; and (7) compliance with local labor laws and regulations. for example, brexit may, among other things, adversely affect economic and market conditions in the u.k. and the e.u. and create uncertainty around doing business in the u.k., including with respect to data protection and transfer, tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees. events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. from time to time the company may need or desire to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the company revolving credit facility, will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the company access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the company financial performance, (2) the company credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance, particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating, that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it. technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company ability to protect its intellectual property rights. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. the company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, protection of the company intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. there can be no assurance that the company efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy. the company business relies on certain intellectual property and brands. the company businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect their 26 table of contents intellectual property and brand names. the company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. however, the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the company operates or where its products are available. any failure by the company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company results of operations or financial condition. in addition, the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims. newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control. newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company newspaper publishing units. during the quarter ended june 30, 2017, the company average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 10% lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years on a constant currency basis. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers, which has led to increases in newsprint prices. failure to maintain the company current consumption levels, further supplier closure and consolidation or the inability to maintain the company existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future. the company relationship with nar is an important part of its digital real estate services business in the u.s. and this business could be harmed if it were to lose the benefits of this relationship . move, the company digital real estate services business in the u.s., licenses the realtor.com &reg; trademark and website address, as well as the realtor &reg; trademark, from nar pursuant to a trademark license agreement (the nar license ). move also operates the realtor.com &reg; website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration. however, nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. if the operating agreement with nar is terminated, the nar license would also terminate, and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com &reg; website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. nar would then be able to operate a realtor.com &reg; website, either by itself or with another third party. in addition to the contractual limitations and risks described above, any adverse developments in move business relationship with nar as a result of existing or new areas of conflict or potential conflict between move interests and nar interests, changes in the real estate industry or other causes could also adversely affect move business, particularly as many of its customers and data providers are members of, have interests that are closely aligned with, or are otherwise influenced by, nar. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company business. in a variety of the company businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. the market price of the company stock may fluctuate significantly. the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the company quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its 27 table of contents industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company operating results; (3) success or failure of the company business strategy; (4) the company ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (14) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the u.s. the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks and newspapers (the broadcast ownership rules ) and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest (the program access rules ). under the fcc rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the murdoch family trust ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules. consequently, the company future conduct, including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator, may affect 21st century fox ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules, or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules. therefore, the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires, after the distribution date, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the u.s. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business, then the company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. in addition, the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor, including a cable television operator, if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject. this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox business. certain of the company directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox, and certain of the company officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of 21st century fox, which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox. certain of the company directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of 21st century fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox, lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as the company co-chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox, and james r. murdoch, who serves as a director of the company and chief executive officer of 21st century fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox 28 table of contents regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement, the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates. the company restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company restated certificate of incorporation) to 21st century fox instead of the company. as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation, the provisions in the company restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company. certain provisions of the company restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, tax sharing and indemnification agreement, separation and distribution agreement and delaware law, the company second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; special stockholders meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; vacancies on the board of directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. 29 table of contents in addition, in connection with the separation, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in june 2014 and again in june 2015. pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the company common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company class b common stock immediately following the separation. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. the rights expire on june 18, 2018, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 7, 2017, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company class b common stock and less than one percent of the company class a common stock as of august 7, 2017. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 7, 2017. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about

media such as television and outdoor displays. competition for subscriptions and circulation is based on news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness. as a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the company news and information services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both

engines, social media platforms, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms.

and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates, including the european union and australia. for example, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive (directive 95/46/ec). fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25, 2018, the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and 14 table of contents freedoms of individuals, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million euros, or approximately 23 million u.s. dollars, or 4% of an entity worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication (e-privacy) directive with a regulation to, among other things, amend the current directive rules on the use of cookies and opt-outs. in 2016, the european commission adopted a new mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield. the company has not certified to, and does not rely on, the privacy shield framework for data transfers among the company businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms. however, certain of the company service providers do rely on the privacy shield. the privacy shield is subject to significant uncertainty, including an annual review procedure by u.s. and e.u. authorities, that could affect the company or its service providers obligations thereunder. the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data, including the european union standard contractual clauses, are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms, and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted, could cause the company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services. in australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. industry participants in the u.s., europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the united states and internationally. the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the company data privacy and security compliance programs. u.k. press regulation as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, a press recognition panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. once approved by the press recognition panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. in addition to the new press recognition panel, legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. publications representing the majority of the industry in the u.k., including news uk, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso. ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel. ipso has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. ipso oversees the editors code of practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections 15 table of contents and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors code of practice and levy fines of up to &pound;1 million. ipso has also introduced a pilot arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members, including the company newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. u.k. radio broadcasting regulation the company radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. intellectual property the company intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. these licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the national rugby league, australian football league, cricket australia, football federation australia and australian rugby union described in note 16 to the financial statements; (2) licenses from various third parties, including arris, of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the company pay-tv business; (3) the trademark license from nar for the realtor.com &reg; trademark and website address, as well as the realtor &reg; trademark (the nar license ); and (4) the trademark licenses from twentieth century fox film corporation and fox international channels (us) inc. for the use of fox formative trademarks used in the company pay-tv and sports programming businesses in australia (the fox licenses ). in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-tv services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. policing unauthorized use of the company products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company intellectual property. the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company operations. moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited 16 table of contents in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2018, the company had approximately 28,000 employees, of whom approximately 9,000 were located in the u.s., 5,000 were located in the u.k. and 10,000 were located in australia. of the company employees, approximately 6,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating the company and its common stock. any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the company business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company common stock. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of content, and its success depends on its ability to compete effectively. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content, including both traditional and new content providers. this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues in the company news and information services segment may continue to decline, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers increasing reliance on a variety of content providers, including news aggregation websites, social media platforms and customized news feeds, for the delivery of news and information through the internet, often without charge. in addition, due to the increased availability of high-speed internet access and innovations in content distribution platforms that enable streaming and downloading of programming, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content on smart tvs, computers, tablets, streaming devices and mobile devices through a variety of providers. these include iptv providers and svod services such as fetch tv, netflix, stan, amazon prime video, hayu and mubi, as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs, disney and the fta networks that have begun providing content, including smaller, lower-cost programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet, in some cases also without charge. the increasing number of choices available to consumers for video content may cause subscribers to the company pay-tv services to disconnect their services, downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages or purchase certain services from other providers that they would have historically purchased from the company. this may, in turn, adversely affect both the company subscription revenue and advertisers willingness to purchase television advertising from the company. 17 table of contents the company ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. for example, the company relies on audience acceptance of the high-quality differentiated content in its newspapers, book titles, pay-tv programming and radio stations in order to retain and grow their audiences, consumers and subscribers. similarly, the success of the company digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive, current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors, which the company generally obtains through short-term arrangements with mlss, real estate brokers, real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed and/or may be terminated with limited or no notice. however, when faced with a multitude of media choices, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume content than they do on the source, quality or reliability of such content. online traffic is also driven by internet search results and referrals from social media and other platforms. search engine results are based on algorithms that change frequently, and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users. any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the company businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to the company digital properties, lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic or otherwise adversely affect the company business. some of the company current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does, which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions. if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company products and services less valuable. for example, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, often without charge, internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading and digital distribution models for books, have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where, how and at what price they consume content. enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the company newspapers, television programs and other products and the price consumers are willing to pay for such products. in addition, other technological developments, such as those allowing consumers to skip, fast forward through or block advertisements, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could adversely affect the attractiveness of the company offerings to advertisers. other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company, often at a lower cost. this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internet-based products and services. additional digital distribution channels, such as the internet and online retailers, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the company businesses, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing. the company must continue to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers and are delivered in the manner in which consumers and customers wish to consume them. the company may be required to incur 18 table of contents significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior, and to attract and retain employees with the skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate its digital and other businesses. for example, the company expects to make significant investments in its pay-tv business as it continues to develop and improve the capabilities of its services, including potential new svod services. the development of new strategies and technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process, and there is a risk that the company may not be able to develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner and that its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including new product offerings and the distribution of its content on a pay basis, may not be accepted by consumers. the company failure to respond to and develop new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, products, services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base or its advertisers to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses, asset values, financial condition and results of operations. a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, integrated marketing services, digital media properties, cable channels and other pay-tv programming and radio stations. the company ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) demand for the company products and services, (2) audience fragmentation, (3) digital advertising trends, (4) its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers, (5) general economic and business conditions, (6) demographics of the customer base, (7) advertising rates and (8) advertising effectiveness. demand for the company products and services depends upon the company ability to differentiate those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behaviors and is evaluated based on a variety of metrics. for example, circulation levels for the company newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates. for the company digital media properties, including its digital real estate services sites, advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand, particularly demand generated through new platforms, may lead to under-measurement and, in turn, lower advertising pricing and spending. the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms. this shift has significantly impacted the company print advertising revenues in particular, which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years. the development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. in addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. as a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure. consequently, the company digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure. new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. in addition, 19 table of contents evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block, change the location of, or obscure, the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices and/or block or delete cookies, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. as the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the company ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, derive better demographic and other information about its users, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content, and video and mobile advertising, and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings. in recent years, large digital platforms such as facebook and google, which have extensive audience reach and targeting capabilities, have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market, and the company expects this trend may continue. the company print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions, including consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation, advertisers budgeting and buying patterns, which tend to be cyclical, as well as federal, state and local election cycles. in addition, certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. some of these sectors, such as retail, are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition. a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the company overall advertising revenue. while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. reduced demand for the company offerings, a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company businesses and assets, results of operations and financial condition. the inability to obtain and retain sports and other programming rights could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company operating businesses, and programming costs could also increase upon renewal. competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and the success of certain of the company operating businesses, including its pay-tv business, will depend on, among other things, their ability to obtain and retain desirable programming and deliver it to subscribers and audiences at competitive prices. the pay-tv industry in particular has continued to experience higher programming costs due to, among other things, (1) increases imposed by sports and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts; (2) the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and svod programming; and (3) increased competition from other digital media companies, including svod providers, for the rights to popular or exclusive content. certain of the company operating businesses, including its pay-tv business, are party to contracts for sports and other programming rights with various third parties, including professional sports leagues and teams, television and motion picture producers and other suppliers. these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms, and as they expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought. however, third parties may outbid the company for those rights and/or for any new programming offerings. in addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own direct-to-consumer sports offerings or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers or audiences, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. in addition, the company results could be adversely affected if upon renewal, escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. 20 table of contents the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the company senior management from the company operations, (6) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (7) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (8) in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (9) liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments and (10) in some cases, increased regulation. if any acquired business or investment, including the recent combination of foxtel and fox sports australia, fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company existing businesses, the company business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company results of operations. the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt. as of june 30, 2018, the new foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is australian dollars, had $575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in u.s. dollars. the company policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable. however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements. in addition, the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company reporting currency, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. since the company financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the company earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into u.s. dollars for inclusion in the company consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. in particular, exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to continued political uncertainty in the u.k. and the negotiation of its exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company business. the u.s. and global economies have undergone, and continue to experience, periods of economic and market uncertainty, including as a result of recent trade disputes between a number of countries. these conditions have in the past resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit and capital markets, limited access to 21 table of contents the credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market. the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including advertising revenues. any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company business, reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers, television operations, books, digital real estate services business, radio stations and other consumer products and services. in addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 32% of its fiscal 2018 revenues from australia. as a result, the company results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market. the company also generated approximately 16% of its fiscal 2018 revenues from the u.k., which continues to experience political, regulatory, economic and market uncertainty as it negotiates the terms of brexit. while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict, it could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary, political and regulatory landscape, lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union, result in the diminishment or elimination of barrier-free access between the u.k. and other european union member states and additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company businesses in the u.k. and elsewhere. although the company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets, including the company revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the company liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, reputational damage or other harm to the company business. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company network management, are important to its business activities and contain the company proprietary, confidential and sensitive business information, including personal data of its customers and personnel. the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and cloud-based systems and services that support a variety of business operations. network and information systems-related events affecting the company systems, or those of third parties upon which the company business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the company business and/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events. unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the company employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the company systems, facilities or data, or those of third parties with whom the company does business. in addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security. 22 table of contents in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the company digital businesses expand. the company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the company to date, individually or in the aggregate. while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. while the company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the company systems. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, including degradation or disruption of service, equipment damage, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, audience, advertisers or revenues and other financial losses. if any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal and credit card data, as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the company business, including its intellectual property, the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. in addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact the company brand and reputation and materially affect its business. the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company industry and challenging economic and market conditions, the company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company financial results. when the company acquires a business, it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, as of the acquisition date. the company management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment. in accordance with gaap, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads, distribution networks, publishing imprints, radio broadcast licenses, trademarks and trade names, publishing rights and customer relationships, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. for example, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue, the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights and/or consumer acceptance of new products, including new svod services, could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, 23 table of contents investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required. any such charge could be material to the company reported results of operations. for example, in fiscal 2018, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $280 million, primarily related to news america marketing and fox sports australia, and a $957 million non-cash write-down of its investment in foxtel. in addition, as of june 30, 2018, the company had approximately $170 million of goodwill that is at risk for future impairment because the fair value of the corresponding reporting unit was equal to its carrying value. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it, and the significant leverage of its new foxtel operating subsidiaries could limit the ability of those subsidiaries to access the credit and capital markets and have other adverse effects. from time to time the company may need or desire to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the company revolving credit facility, will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the company access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors. in addition, as a result of the transaction, the company now consolidates the debt of its new foxtel operating subsidiaries. those subsidiaries have significant leverage that could limit or prevent them from incurring additional debt or refinancing or otherwise extending the maturities of their existing debt. as of june 30, 2018, the new foxtel operating subsidiaries total outstanding indebtedness was $1.6 billion, including $370 million due in fiscal 2019, with the remainder having various maturities through fiscal 2025. factors impacting the company ability to access the credit and capital markets include, but are not limited to: (1) the financial performance of the company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) the company credit ratings or absence of a credit rating and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (3) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents (collectively, the debt documents ); (4) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (5) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance that the company (particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating) will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it. the company consolidated debt could also have other adverse effects. a portion of the outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates, which exposes the company to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. if interest rates increase, the applicable debt service obligations will increase, which could reduce available cash flow and make it more difficult to make scheduled debt payments and/or limit the amount of cash available for operations, including investments and capital expenditures. although the company hedges a portion of the exposure to these interest rate movements, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements. in addition, the new foxtel operating subsidiaries outstanding debt documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility. subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict or prohibit these operating subsidiaries from, among other things, undertaking certain transactions, disposing of properties or assets (including subsidiary stock), merging or consolidating with any other person, making financial accommodation available, giving guarantees, entering into certain other financing arrangements, creating or permitting certain liens, engaging in transactions with affiliates, making repayments of other loans and undergoing fundamental business changes. these instruments also generally include financial covenants requiring the new foxtel operating subsidiaries to maintain specified total debt to ebitda and interest coverage ratios. in the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any of the new foxtel operating subsidiaries debt documents, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable debt documents, which could result in a default under other outstanding debt documents and could have a material adverse impact on the company business, results of operation and financial condition. 24 table of contents the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. in addition, laws and regulations in some international jurisdictions differ from those in the united states, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply. the company australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as new foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event; the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; other parts of the broadcasting services act that regulate ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities; and the telecommunications act and associated codes, which apply various consumer protection regimes to new foxtel as a telecommunications service provider. the company business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have implications for how such data is managed. many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. complying with these laws and regulations could be costly, require the company to change its business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the company business in a manner adverse to its business operations, including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted, data-driven advertising offerings. the company failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, or as a result of a compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems by a third party, could result in exposure to enforcement by u.s. federal or state or foreign governments or private actors, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. an example of such a law is the european union gdpr, which recently went into effect and expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance. see governmental regulation data privacy and security for more information. finally, because some of the company products and services are available on the internet, it may be subject to laws or regulations exposing it to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence. in addition, the company newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press. following the inquiry, the u.k. government established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body. publishers who are not members of an approved regulator, including the 25 table of contents company, may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. the majority of the u.k. press, including news uk, has established an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso. ipso, which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel, has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the u.k. these powers, which include the ability to impose fines of up to &pound;1 million for systemic breaches of ipso editor code of practice, may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. depending on the political environment, the second phase of the leveson inquiry may be commenced, investigating the relationship between the press and the police. the company radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company business practices and operating results. from time to time, the company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property and other matters. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 16 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters. the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company results of operations or financial condition as well as the company ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. in addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. the company is subject to taxation in u.s. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-u.s. jurisdictions, including australia and the u.k. the company effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the company profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company deferred tax assets. evaluating and estimating the company tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the company tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company tax returns or positions taken by the company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company. although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. as a result, the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. 26 table of contents in connection with the separation, 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service ( irs ) and an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the separation for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st century fox and/or the company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st century fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company common stock distributed to 21st century fox stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox tax basis in such shares. the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. specifically, under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, or (3) the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act. the tax act instituted significant changes to the u.s. corporate income tax system including, among other things, lowering the corporate tax rate and implementing a partial territorial tax system. the company recorded provisional charges during fiscal 2018 for certain transitional impacts associated with these changes. in addition, a number of other provisions in the tax act do not take effect until fiscal 2019, including changes to limits on the deductions for executive compensation, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income, the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income. the company continues to assess the full impact of the tax act, including finalizing the transitional impacts referenced above, and cannot predict the manner in which provisions of the tax act or any related regulations, legislation or accounting standards may be interpreted or enforced or whether such interpretation or enforcement may have a material adverse effect on its income tax expense and/or its business, financial condition and results of operations. see note 19 to the financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the tax act. the company international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. in its fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, approximately 57% of the company revenues were derived outside the u.s., and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (4) compliance with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements such as the gdpr; (5) compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act; (6) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; and (7) compliance with local labor laws and regulations. for example, brexit may, among other things, adversely affect economic and market conditions in the u.k. and the european union and create uncertainty around doing business in the u.k., including with respect to data protection and transfer, tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees. events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. challenges 27 table of contents associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities. the company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that contain operational and management restrictions and/or other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the company. the company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that restrict the company ability to take specified actions and contain other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the company. for example, the company and telstra are parties to a shareholders agreement with respect to new foxtel containing certain minority protections for telstra, including standard governance provisions, as well as transfer and exit rights. the shareholders agreement provides telstra with the right to appoint two directors to the board of new foxtel, as well as board and shareholder-level veto rights over certain non-ordinary course and/or material corporate actions that may prevent new foxtel from taking actions that are in the interests of the company. the shareholders agreement also provides for (1) certain transfer restrictions, which could adversely affect the company ability to effect such transfers and/or the prices at which those transfers may occur, and (2) exit arrangements, which could, in certain circumstances, force the company to sell its interest, subject to rights of first and, in some cases, last refusals. in addition, move, the company digital real estate services business in the u.s., operates the realtor.com &reg; website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration. however, nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. if the operating agreement with nar is terminated, the nar license would also terminate, and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com &reg; website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. nar would then be able to operate a realtor.com &reg; website, either by itself or with another third party. theft of the company content, including digital piracy and signal theft, may decrease revenue and adversely affect the company business and profitability. the company success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content, and theft of its brands, programming, digital content, books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content. developments in technology, including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material, including from other less-regulated countries into the company primary markets. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by preventing unauthorized access to such content through the use of encryption of programming content, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, these efforts are not always successful, and the company cannot ensure that it will be able to reduce or control theft of its content. moreover, protection of the company intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the proliferation of unauthorized use of the company content may have an adverse effect on its business and profitability by reducing the revenue that the company potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. failure by the company to protect certain intellectual property and brands could adversely impact the company results of operation and financial condition. the company businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names and other proprietary rights, as well as licenses and other contractual arrangements, including licenses relating to 28 table of contents sports programming rights, set-top box technology and related systems, the nar license and the fox licenses, to establish, obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses. the company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. however, the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the company operates or where its products are available. any failure by the company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company results of operations or financial condition. in addition, the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims. newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control, and any increase in newsprint costs may adversely affect the company business, results of operations and financial condition. newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company newspaper publishing units. during the quarter ended june 30, 2018, the company average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 1% lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years on a constant currency basis. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and a number of factors may cause prices to increase, including: (1) the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills, which has reduced the number of suppliers over the years; (2) the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-u.s. suppliers of paper; (3) an increase in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors; (4) failure to maintain the company current consumption levels; and (5) the inability to maintain the company existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers. any increase in the cost of newsprint could have an adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. damage, failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities that the company pay-tv business depends upon to distribute its programming could adversely affect the company business and results of operations . the company pay-tv business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. the distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. in addition, each of the company cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities. transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. these events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of pay-tv services to the company customers. the company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. instead, the company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. however, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. the company pay-tv business depends on a single or limited number of third party service providers and suppliers for certain key products or services , and any reduction or interruption in the supply of these products and services or a significant increase in price could have an adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. the company pay-tv business depends on a single or limited number of third party service providers and suppliers to supply certain key products and services necessary to provide its pay-tv services. in particular, the 29 table of contents company depends on optus to provide all of its satellite transponder capacity, and arris and technicolor are the company sole suppliers of satellite and cable set-top boxes and the foxtel now box, respectively. if any of these service providers or suppliers breaches or terminates their agreements with the company or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner, experiences operating or financial difficulties, is unable to meet demand due to component shortages, insufficient capacity or otherwise, significantly increases the amount the company pays for necessary products or services or ceases production of any necessary product, the company business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. while the company will seek alternative sources for these products and services where possible, it may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could impair its ability to timely deliver its products and services to its subscribers or operate its business. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company business. in a variety of the company businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. the market price of the company stock may fluctuate significantly. the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the company quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company operating results; (3) success or failure of the company business strategy; (4) the company ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (14) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. certain of the company directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox, and certain of the company officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of 21st century fox, which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox. certain of the company directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of 21st century fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox, lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as the company co-chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox, and james r. murdoch, who serves as a director of the company and chief executive officer of 21st century fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement, the company and 30 table of contents 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates. the company restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company restated certificate of incorporation) to 21st century fox instead of the company. as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation, the provisions in the company restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company. certain provisions of the company restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, tax sharing and indemnification agreement, separation and distribution agreement and delaware law, the company third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers, and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; special stockholders meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; vacancies on the board of directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. in addition, in connection with the separation, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in june 2014, june 2015 and again in june 2018. pursuant to the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the company common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and 31 table of contents class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company class b common stock immediately following the separation. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. the rights expire on june 18, 2021, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 7, 2018, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company class b common stock and less than one percent of the company class a common stock as of august 7, 2018. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 7, 2018. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 82 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates and stock prices. when deemed appropriate, the company uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. the following sections provide quantitative information on the company exposure to foreign currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other relevant market risks. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. foreign currency rates the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. operations. because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years. the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017: u.s. dollars australian dollars british pound sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 revenues 43 % 34 % 18 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 44 % 31 % 19 % fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 revenues 47 % 29 % 19 % operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses 47 % 26 % 20 % based on the year ended june 30, 2018, a one cent change in each of the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $39 million and $12 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately $8 million and $1 million, respectively, on an annual basis. derivatives and hedging as a result of the transaction, the company consolidated foxtel portfolio of debt and derivative instruments. as of june 30, 2018, the new foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is australian dollars, had $575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in u.s. dollars. the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars. new foxtel utilizes cross-currency swaps, designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to 82 table of contents interest and principal payments on its u.s. dollar denominated debt. the total notional value of these cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were $296 million (a$400 million) and $74 million (a$100 million), respectively, as of june 30, 2018. new foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to u.s. dollar payments for license fees. the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was $100 million as of june 30, 2018. in addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the company also uses certain derivatives not designated as accounting hedges to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk. these are referred to as economic hedges. the total notional value of cross currency interest rate derivatives was $75 million as of june 30, 2018. refer to the table below for further details of the sensitivity of the company financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange risk. as of june 30,

rates the company current financing arrangements and facilities include approximately $650 million of outstanding fixed-rate debt and approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding variable-rate bank facilities, before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (see note 9 borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). fixed and variable-rate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates. a change in the interest rate or yield of fixed-rate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt, while a change in the interest rate of variable-rate debt will impact interest expense, as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt. in connection with these borrowings, new foxtel has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap u.s. dollar denominated fixed interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate. as discussed above, new foxtel utilizes cross-currency swaps, designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its u.s. dollar denominated debt. the company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to swap australian dollar denominated variable interest payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rates. as of june 30, 2018, the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was $518 million (a$700 million). refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk. 83 table of contents stock prices the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $93 million as of june 30, 2018. a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately $9 million before tax. any changes in fair value of the company common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed other-than-temporary. credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. the company receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30, 2018 or june 30, 2017 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the company products and services are sold. the company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. as of june 30, 2018, the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. 84 table of contentsrisk factors 19 risk factors in this annual report. the company does not ordinarily make projections of

range of media businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services. the company newspapers, magazines, digital publications and radio stations compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, magazines and radio stations, social media sources, as well as other media such as television and outdoor displays. competition for subscriptions and circulation is based on news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness. as a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the company news and information services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue from a variety of alternative news and information sources. these include both paid and free websites, digital apps, news aggregators, blogs, search engines, social media networks, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms, including off-platform distribution of its products. shifts in consumer behavior, including the widespread adoption of mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices as platforms through which news and 8 table of contents information is consumed, require the company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. the company believes that these changes

presented by these changes. dow jones professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global

things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. the company believes that based on the scale of nam home-delivered products, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the growing audience for its digital marketing platform, nam provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. the company is also actively investing in shopper research and data-based insights that enable an advanced understanding of how to apply the company media and incentive network to

with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional free to air ( fta ) tv operators in australia, including the three major commercial fta networks and two major government-funded fta broadcasters, and new content providers that deliver video programming over the internet. these providers include internet protocol television, or iptv, and subscription video-on-demand, or svod, providers such as fetch tv, netflix, stan and amazon prime video; streaming services offered through digital media providers, such as youtube and facebook; as well as programmers and distributors, such as cbs, disney and the fta networks, that provide, or have indicated an intention to provide, content, including smaller, lower-cost or free programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet. the company believes that foxtel premium and exclusive content, wide array of products and services, set-top box features that enable subscribers to record, rewind, discover and watch content, its investment in on demand capability and 10 table of contents programming and benefits through broadband bundling enable it to offer subscribers a compelling alternative to its competitors.

formats, and nearly all of harpercollins new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as downloadable audio books, represented approximately 20% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019. with the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, harpercollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. during fiscal 2019, harpercollins u.s. had 141 titles on the new york times print and digital bestseller lists, with 22 titles hitting number one, including girl, wash your face and girl, stop apologizing by rachel hollis, homebody , magnolia table and we are the gardeners by

companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including amazon, apple, barnes &amp; noble and tesco. revenues at the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of harpercollins books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the company second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. the book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. harpercollins competes with other large publishers, such as penguin random house, simon &amp; schuster and hachette livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. in addition, harpercollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. the company believes harpercollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. furthermore, harpercollins is a leader in children and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption. digital real estate services the company digital real estate services segment consists of its 61.6% interest in rea group, a

subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the company interests. australian media regulation the company subscription television interests are subject to australia regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry, including the australian broadcasting services act 1992 (cth) (the broadcasting services act ) and the telecommunications act 1997 (cth) (the telecommunications act ) and associated codes. the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority. key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions currently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the broadcasting services act, subscription television providers are 14 table of contents prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the australian population or the rights are held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) other parts of the broadcasting services act that may impact the company ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. foxtel is also subject to various consumer protection regimes under the telecommunications act and associated codes, which apply to foxtel as a telecommunications service provider. data privacy and security the company business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. for example, in the u.s., certain of the company websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the children online privacy protection act of 1998, which prohibits the collection of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. in addition, the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. more state and local governments are also expanding, enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ), which will take effect on january 1, 2020, is one such example, putting greater restrictions on how the company can collect and use personal information. similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates, including the european union and australia. for example, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive (directive 95/46/ec). fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25, 2018, the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million euros, or approximately 23 million u.s. dollars, or 4% of an entity worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication (e-privacy) directive with a regulation to, among other things, amend the current directive rules on the use of cookies and opt-outs. in 2016, the european commission adopted a new mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield. other than for one business unit operating an advertising exchange, the company has not certified to, and does not rely on, the privacy shield framework for data transfers among the company businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms. however, certain of the company service providers do rely on the privacy shield. the privacy shield is subject to significant uncertainty, including an annual review procedure by u.s. and e.u. authorities and a legal challenge scheduled to be heard by the general court of the e.u. in july 2019, that could affect the company or its service providers obligations thereunder. the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data, including the european union 15 table of contents standard contractual clauses, are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms, and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted, could cause the company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services. in australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. industry participants in the u.s., europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the united states and internationally. the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the company data privacy and security compliance programs. u.k. press regulation as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, a press recognition panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. once approved by the press recognition panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. in addition to the press recognition panel, certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. press regulator impress was recognized as an approved regulator by the press recognition panel on october 25, 2016. however, publications representing the majority of the industry in the u.k., including news uk, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso, in september 2014. ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel. ipso has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. ipso oversees the editors code of practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors code of practice and levy fines of up to &pound;1 million. ipso has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members, including the company newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. u.k. radio broadcasting regulation the company radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. 16 table of contents intellectual property the company intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. these licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the national rugby league, australian football league, cricket australia, v8 supercars, formula one, football federation australia, australian rugby union and other broadcasting rights described in note 16 to the financial statements; (2) licenses from various third parties, including arris, of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the company pay-tv business; (3) the trademark license for the realtor.com &reg; website address, as well as the realtor &reg; trademark (the nar license ); and (4) the trademark licenses for the use of fox formative trademarks used in the company pay-tv business in australia (the fox licenses ). in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from its intellectual property assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-tv services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to other television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. policing unauthorized use of the company products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company intellectual property. the company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. the company also seeks to limit such threat by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. however, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company operations. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2019, the company had approximately 28,000 employees, of whom approximately 10,000 were located in the u.s., 4,000 were located in the u.k. and 10,000 were located in australia. of the company 17 table of contents employees, approximately 5,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. explanatory note regarding certain key metrics unique users for purposes of this annual report, the company counts unique users the first time an individual accesses a product website using a browser during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses a product mobile or tablet app using a mobile or tablet device during a calendar month. if the user accesses more than one of a product desktop websites, mobile websites, mobile apps and/or tablet apps, the first access to each such website or app is counted as a separate unique user. in addition, users accessing a product websites through different browsers, users who clear their browser cache at any time and users who access a product websites and apps through different devices are also counted as separate unique users. for a group of products such as wsjdn, a user accessing different products within the group is counted as a separate unique user for each product accessed. broadcast subscribers broadcast subscribers consist of residential subscribers and commercial subscribers, which are calculated as described below. residential subscribers total number of residential subscribers represents total residential subscribers to the company pay-tv services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships. commercial subscribers commercial subscribers for the company pay-tv business are calculated as residential equivalent business units, which are derived by dividing total recurring revenue from these subscribers by an estimated average broadcast arpu which is held constant through the year. total number of commercial subscribers represents total commercial subscribers to the company pay-tv services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships. broadcast arpu the company calculates broadcast arpu for its pay-tv business by dividing broadcast package revenues for the period, net of customer credits, promotions and other discounts, by average cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by the number of months in the period. average cable and satellite residential subscribers, or average broadcast subscribers, for a given period is calculated by first adding the beginning and ending cable and satellite residential subscribers for each month in the period and dividing by two and then adding each of those monthly average subscriber numbers and dividing by the number of months in the period. broadcast subscriber churn the company calculates broadcast subscriber churn for its pay-tv business by dividing the total number of disconnected cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period, net of reconnects and transfers, by the average broadcast subscribers for the period, calculated as described above. this amount is then divided by the number of days in the period and multiplied by 365 days to present churn on an annual basis. 18 table of contents item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating the company and its common stock. any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the company business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company common stock. the company businesses operate in a highly competitive business environment, and the company success depends on its ability to compete effectively. the company businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment, including both traditional and new content providers. this competition continues to intensify as a result of rapid changes in technologies and platforms, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues in the company news and information services segment may continue to decline, reflecting consumers increasing reliance on a variety of content providers and platforms, including search engines, news aggregation websites, social media networks and customized news feeds, for the delivery of news and information, often without charge. in addition, due to the increased availability of high-speed internet access and innovations in content distribution platforms that enable streaming and downloading of programming, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content through an increasing variety of providers. these providers include iptv and svod services, such as fetch tv, netflix, stan and amazon prime video, streaming services offered through digital media providers, such as youtube and facebook, as well as programmers and distributors, such as cbs, disney and the fta networks, that have begun providing content, including smaller, lower-cost or free programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet. the increasing number of choices available to consumers for video content has caused some of the subscribers to the company pay-tv services to disconnect their services, downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages or purchase certain services from other providers, and this may continue. this trend has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, both the company subscription revenue and, in turn, advertisers willingness to purchase television advertising from the company. in order to compete effectively, the company must differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. for example, the company relies on acceptance of the high-quality differentiated content in its newspapers, book titles, pay-tv programming and radio stations, as well as its wide array of digital and mobile products and services, in order to retain and grow its audiences, consumers and subscribers. however, when faced with a multitude of choices, consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source, quality or reliability. online traffic and product purchases are also driven by internet search results, referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores. search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that change frequently, and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users. any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the company businesses, including those affecting how the company content, apps and products are prioritized, displayed and monetized, could result in significant decreases in traffic to the company digital properties, lower advertiser interest in those properties, increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lower product sales and subscriptions or otherwise adversely affect the company business. from time to time, the company may pursue new strategic initiatives in order to remain competitive, such as its ott strategy and its planned migration of subscribers from cable to satellite or internet delivery at its pay-tv business and its new concierge model for its u.s. digital real estate business. the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures, marketing and other costs in order to implement these strategies, which may be dilutive to its earnings. there can be no assurance these initiatives will be successful in the manner or 19 table of contents time period the company expects or that it will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits it expects such strategy to achieve. the failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, the company is targeting a different demographic with its new streaming services, which are offered at a lower price point than its traditional broadcast subscription packages. however, if instead those streaming offerings cause broadcast subscribers to disconnect their services or downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages, the company revenues may be materially and adversely affected. some of the company current and potential competitors may have greater resources, fewer regulatory burdens, better competitive positions in certain areas, greater operating capabilities, greater access to sources of content or other services and/or easier access to financing, which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology, consumer preferences and market conditions. continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the company businesses operate may increase these advantages, including through greater scale, financial leverage and/or access to content and other offerings. if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company products and services less valuable. for example, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, often without charge, internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading and digital distribution models for books, have empowered consumers to seek more control over the convenience and price of content consumption. enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the company newspapers, television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay for such products and services. consumption of the company content on new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates. in addition, other technological developments, such as those allowing consumers to skip, fast forward through or block advertisements or otherwise time-shift viewing, may cause changes in consumer behavior that adversely affect the attractiveness of the company offerings to advertisers. technological developments have in many cases also increased competition by significantly lowering barriers to entry. for example, content providers are now able to compete with our pay-tv business via direct-to-consumer offerings, as internet streaming capabilities enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure. other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company, often at a lower cost. this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content. additional digital distribution channels, such as online retailers and digital marketplaces, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the company business models, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing. the company must continue to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to ensure its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers, are delivered in the manner in which consumers and customers wish to consume them and are offered at competitive prices. the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior, and to attract 20 table of contents and retain employees with the necessary skill sets and knowledge base. for example, the company has made, and expects to continue to makes investments and incur costs in its pay-tv business as it continues to develop and improve its ott services, including its recently-launched kayo sports streaming service, foxtel now and other potential new ott services. the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process, and there is a risk the company may not be able to develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner and its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including new product offerings, may not be accepted by consumers or generate sufficient revenues to be profitable. the company failure to respond to and develop new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, products and services to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base or its advertisers to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its business, asset values, results of operations and financial condition. a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, integrated marketing services, digital media properties, cable channels and other pay-tv programming and radio stations. the company ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) demand for the company products and services, (2) audience fragmentation, (3) digital advertising trends, (4) its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers, (5) general economic and business conditions, (6) demographics of the customer base, (7) advertising rates and (8) advertising effectiveness. demand for the company products and services depends upon the company ability to differentiate those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behaviors and is evaluated based on a variety of metrics. for example, circulation levels for the company newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates. for the company digital media properties, advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand, particularly demand generated through new platforms, may lead to under-measurement and, in turn, lower advertising pricing and spending. the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms. this shift has significantly impacted the company print advertising revenues in particular, which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years. the development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. in addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. as a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure. consequently, the company digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure. new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. in addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology and policies that adversely affect the company ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness 21 table of contents of its advertising such as blocking, changing the location of, or obscuring, the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices and/or blocking or deleting cookies, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. as the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the company ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, collect and leverage better user data, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content, and video and mobile advertising, and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings. in recent years, large digital platforms such as facebook, google and amazon, which have extensive audience reach and targeting capabilities, have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market, and the company expects this trend may continue. the company print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions, including consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation, advertisers budgeting and buying patterns, which tend to be cyclical, as well as federal, state and local election cycles. in addition, certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. some of these sectors, such as retail, are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition. a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the company overall advertising revenue. while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. reduced demand for the company offerings, a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company businesses and assets, results of operations and financial condition. the inability to obtain and retain sports, entertainment and other programming rights and content could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company operating businesses, and costs could also increase upon renewal. competition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense, and the success of certain of the company operating businesses, including its pay-tv business, depends on, among other things, their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof, such as music rights, that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices. the pay-tv industry, including the company pay-tv business, has experienced higher programming costs due to, among other things, (1) increases imposed by sports, entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts; (2) the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and svod programming; and (3) increased competition from other digital media companies, including svod providers, for the rights to popular or exclusive content. certain of the company operating businesses, including its pay-tv business, are party to contracts for sports, entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties, including professional sports leagues and teams, television and motion picture producers and other content providers. these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms, and as they expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought. in the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire, the financial and other terms of these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the company control, such as changes in the company bargaining power or in the industry, and in order to retain or extend such rights, the company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs. furthermore, third parties may outbid the company for those rights and/or for any new programming offerings. in addition, as other content providers develop their own competing services, they may be unwilling to provide the company with 22 table of contents access to certain content. for example, professional sports leagues or teams, as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs and disney, have created and may continue to create their own direct-to-consumer offerings. further, consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the company. the loss of rights may adversely affect the breadth or quality of the company content offerings, including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers or audiences, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. in addition, the company business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal, escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions, investments and divestitures that introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the company senior management from the company operations, (6) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (7) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (8) in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (9) liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments and (10) in some cases, increased regulation. if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company existing businesses, the company business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets. in addition, the company has divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets. divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the company business, results of operations and financial condition. these include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to its business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees, difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business and possible retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company results of operations. the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt. as of june 30, 2019, the foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is australian dollars, had approximately $575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in u.s. dollars. the company policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable. however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements. in addition, the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company reporting currency, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. since the 23 table of contents company financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the company earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into u.s. dollars for inclusion in the company consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. in particular, exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to continued political uncertainty in the u.k. and the negotiation of its exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company business. the u.s. and global economies have undergone, and continue to experience, periods of economic and market weakness or uncertainty, including as a result of recent trade disputes between a number of countries. these conditions have in the past resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit and capital markets, limited access to the credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market. such market disruptions have often led to broader economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures, lower demand for the company products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the company business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company business and reduce its circulation and subscription, advertising, real estate, consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses. the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 40% of its fiscal 2019 revenues from australia. as a result, the company business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market, including, for example, recent weakness in the australian residential real estate market which has led, and may continue to lead, to lower listing volumes at rea group. the company also generated approximately 13% of its fiscal 2019 revenues from the u.k., which continues to experience political, regulatory, economic and market uncertainty as it negotiates the terms of brexit. while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict, it could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary, political and regulatory landscape, lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union, result in the diminishment or elimination of barrier-free access between the u.k. and other european union member states and additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company businesses in the u.k. and elsewhere. in addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. although the company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets, including the company revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the company liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, reputational damage or other harm to the company business. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company network management, are important to its business activities and contain the company proprietary, confidential and 24 table of contents sensitive business information, including personal data of its customers and personnel. the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and cloud-based systems and services that support a variety of business operations. network and information systems-related events affecting the company systems, or those of third parties upon which the company business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or state-sponsored or other groups, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power and internet outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the company business and/or loss, corruption, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events. unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the company employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the company systems, facilities or data, or those of third parties with whom the company does business. in addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the company network and information systems or compromise information security. in recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the company digital businesses expand. the company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the company to date, individually or in the aggregate. while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. while the company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the company systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, including degradation or disruption of service, equipment damage, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, audience, advertisers, business partners or revenues and other financial losses. if any such failure, interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the company information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal and credit card data, as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the company business, including its intellectual property, the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. the company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies and/or regulators (including the appropriate eu supervisory authority) about any actual or perceived data security breach, as well as the individuals who are affected by any such incident, within strict time periods. in addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in the company systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact the company brand and reputation and materially affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. 25 table of contents the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company industry and challenging market conditions, the company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company results of operations and, in the case of cash restructuring charges, its financial condition. impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the company taxes, including its ability to deduct certain interest costs. the company management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment. in accordance with gaap, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads, distribution networks, publishing imprints, radio broadcast licenses, trademarks and trade names, publishing rights and customer relationships, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. for example, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue, the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights and/or consumer acceptance of new products, including the company new svod services, could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required, and any such charge could be material to the company reported results of operations. for example, in fiscal 2019, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $96 million, primarily related to goodwill at a reporting unit within the news and information services segment. in addition, as of june 30, 2019, the company had approximately $2.0 billion of goodwill that is at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the corresponding reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0% to 5%. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it, and the significant leverage of its foxtel operating subsidiaries could limit the ability of those subsidiaries to access the credit and capital markets and have other adverse effects. from time to time the company expects to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the company revolving credit facility, will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the company access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors. the company foxtel operating subsidiaries have significant leverage that could limit or prevent them from incurring additional debt or refinancing or otherwise extending the maturities of their existing debt. as of june 30, 2019, the foxtel operating subsidiaries total outstanding indebtedness was $1.2 billion, including $281 million due in fiscal 2020, with the remainder having various maturities through fiscal 2025. factors impacting the company ability to access the credit and capital markets include, but are not limited to: (1) the financial and operational performance of the company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) the company credit ratings or absence of a credit rating and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (3) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents (collectively, the debt documents ); (4) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (5) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance that the company (particularly as news corp currently has no credit rating) will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it. 26 table of contents the company consolidated debt could also have other adverse effects. a portion of the outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates, which exposes the company to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. if interest rates increase, the applicable debt service obligations will increase, which could reduce available cash flow and make it more difficult to make scheduled debt payments and/or limit the amount of cash available for operations, including investments and capital expenditures. although the company hedges a portion of the exposure to these interest rate movements, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements. in addition, the foxtel operating subsidiaries outstanding debt documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility. subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict or prohibit these operating subsidiaries from, among other things, undertaking certain transactions, disposing of properties or assets (including subsidiary stock), merging or consolidating with any other person, making financial accommodation available, giving guarantees, entering into certain other financing arrangements, creating or permitting certain liens, engaging in transactions with affiliates, making repayments of other loans and undergoing fundamental business changes. these instruments also generally include financial covenants requiring the foxtel operating subsidiaries to maintain specified total debt to ebitda and interest coverage ratios. in the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any of the foxtel operating subsidiaries debt documents, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable debt documents, which could result in a default under other outstanding debt documents and could have a material adverse impact on the company business, results of operation and financial condition. the company business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. in addition, laws and regulations in some international jurisdictions differ from those in the united states, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply. the company australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event; the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights are held by one of australia two major government-funded broadcasters; other parts of the broadcasting services act that regulate ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities; and the telecommunications act and associated codes, which apply various consumer protection regimes to foxtel as a telecommunications service provider. the company business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have 27 table of contents implications for how such data is managed. many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. complying with these laws and regulations could be costly, require the company to change its business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the company business in a manner adverse to its business operations, including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted, data-driven advertising offerings. the company failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, or as a result of a compromise, breach or interruption of the company systems by a third party, could result in exposure to enforcement by u.s. federal or state or foreign governments or private actors, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. examples of such laws are the european union gdpr, which went into effect in 2018, expanding the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increasing maximum penalties for non-compliance, and california ccpa, which will take effect on january 1, 2020 and will put greater restrictions on the collection and use of personal information. see governmental regulation data privacy and security for more information. finally, because some of the company products and services are available on the internet, it may be subject to laws or regulations exposing it to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence. in addition, the company newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press. following the inquiry, the u.k. government established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body. publishers who are not members of an approved regulator, including the company, may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. the majority of the u.k. press, including news uk, has established an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso. ipso, which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel, has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the u.k. these powers, which include the ability to impose fines of up to &pound;1 million for systemic breaches of ipso editor code of practice, may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. the company radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company business practices and operating results. from time to time, the company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property, employment and other matters. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 16 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters. the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company results of operations or financial condition as well as the company ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. in addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. 28 table of contents the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. the company is subject to taxation in u.s. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-u.s. jurisdictions, including australia and the u.k. the company effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the company profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company deferred tax assets. evaluating and estimating the company tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the company tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company tax returns or positions taken by the company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company. although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. as a result, the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. in connection with the separation, 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service ( irs ) and an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the separation for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st century fox and/or the company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st century fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company common stock distributed to 21st century fox stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox tax basis in such shares. the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing. specifically, under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, or (3) the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act. the tax act instituted significant changes to the u.s. corporate income tax system including, among other things, lowering the corporate tax rate, implementing a partial territorial tax system and, beginning in fiscal 2019, implementing changes to limits on the deductions for executive compensation, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income, the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income. while the company accounting for the effects of the tax act was completed in the second 29 table of contents quarter of fiscal 2019 and the company believes those effects have been appropriately recorded, various interpretive issues remain with respect to the tax act and regulatory guidance on many aspects of the tax act has not been issued. the company continues to monitor, among other things, changes in interpretations of the tax act, any legislative action arising because of the tax act and any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act. the company cannot predict the manner in which provisions of the tax act or any related regulations, legislation or accounting standards may be interpreted or enforced in the future or whether such interpretation or enforcement may have a material adverse effect on its income tax expense and/or its business, results of operations and financial condition. see note 19 to the financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the tax act. on may 31, 2019, the organization for economic cooperation and development released a program of work to develop a consensus solution in relation to its base erosion and profit shifting action 1, addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy. the outcome of this program may change various aspects of the existing framework under which the company tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. in connection with the release of the program, several foreign jurisdictions introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services. there is limited guidance about the applicability of these new taxes to the company businesses and significant uncertainty as to what type of digital services will be deemed in scope. if these new taxes are applied to the company revenue in these foreign jurisdictions, which include the u.k., it could have an adverse impact on its business and financial performance. theft of the company content, including digital piracy and signal theft, may decrease revenue and adversely affect the company business and profitability. the company success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content, and theft of its brands, programming, digital content, books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content. developments in technology, including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream, duplicate and widely distribute pirated material, including from other less-regulated countries into the company primary markets. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, these efforts are not always successful, and the company cannot ensure that it will be able to reduce or control theft of its content. the proliferation of unauthorized use of the company content may have an adverse effect on its business and profitability by reducing the revenue that the company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. moreover, protection of the company intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company rights, or if existing laws are changed, the company ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. in addition, the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated, could make it more difficult for the company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could, in turn, negatively impact its value and further increase the company enforcement costs. the company pay-tv business depends on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain key products or services , and any reduction or interruption in the supply of these products and services or a significant increase in price could have an adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. the company pay-tv business depends on a single or limited number of third party suppliers to supply certain key products and services necessary to provide its pay-tv services. in particular, the company depends on optus 30 table of contents to provide all of its satellite transponder capacity, and arris and technicolor are the company sole suppliers of satellite set-top boxes and the foxtel now box, respectively. if any of these suppliers breaches or terminates their agreements with the company or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner, experiences operating or financial difficulties, is unable to meet demand due to component shortages, insufficient capacity or otherwise, significantly increases the amount the company pays for necessary products or services or ceases production of any necessary product, the company business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. in addition, telstra is the primary supplier of cable distribution capacity for the company pay-tv programming and is also currently the exclusive provider of wholesale fixed voice and broadband services for the company pay-tv business, as well as its primary supplier of wholesale mobile voice and broadband services and the largest reseller of its cable and satellite products. any disruption in the supply of those services or a decline in telstra business could result in disruptions to the supply of, and/or reduce the number of subscribers for, the company products and services, which could, in turn, adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. while the company will seek alternative sources for the products and services described above where possible and/or permissible under applicable agreements, it may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could impair its ability to timely deliver its products and services to its subscribers or operate its business. the company international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. in its fiscal year ended june 30, 2019, approximately 61% of the company revenues were derived outside the u.s., and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (4) compliance with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements such as the gdpr; (5) compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act; (6) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; and (7) compliance with local labor laws and regulations. for example, brexit has and may continue to, among other things, adversely affect economic and market conditions in the u.k. and the european union and create uncertainty around doing business in the u.k., including with respect to data protection and transfer, tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees. events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities. the company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that contain operational and management restrictions and/or other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the company. the company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that restrict the company ability to take specified actions and contain other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the company. for example, the company and telstra are parties to a shareholders agreement with respect to foxtel containing certain minority protections for telstra, including standard governance provisions, as well as transfer and exit rights. the shareholders agreement provides telstra with the right to appoint two directors to the board of foxtel, as well as board and shareholder-level veto rights over certain non-ordinary course and/or material corporate actions that may prevent foxtel from taking actions that are in the interests of the company. the shareholders agreement also provides for (1) certain transfer 31 table of contents restrictions, which could adversely affect the company ability to effect such transfers and/or the prices at which those transfers may occur, and (2) exit arrangements, which could, in certain circumstances, force the company to sell its interest, subject to rights of first and, in some cases, last refusals. in addition, move, the company digital real estate services business in the u.s., operates the realtor.com &reg; website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration. however, nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. if the operating agreement with nar is terminated, the nar license would also terminate, and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com &reg; website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. nar would then be able to operate a realtor.com &reg; website, either by itself or with another third party. failure by the company to protect certain intellectual property and brands, or infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the company business, results of operation and financial condition. the company businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as licenses and other contractual arrangements, including licenses relating to sports programming rights, set-top box technology and related systems, the nar license and the fox licenses, to establish, obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses. the company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. however, the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors and suppliers will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the company operates or where its products are available. any failure by the company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect its or their intellectual property or brands, or any infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the company business, results of operations or financial condition. claims of intellectual property infringement could require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms (if such agreements are available at all), require the company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it, or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property, which could in turn require the company to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. even if the company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management attention and resources away from its business. in addition, the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims. newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control, and any increase in newsprint costs or disruption in newsprint supply may adversely affect the company business, results of operations and financial condition. newsprint is a significant expense for the company newspaper publishing units. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and a number of factors may cause prices to increase, including: (1) the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills or the conversion of newsprint mills to other products or grades of paper, which has reduced the number of newsprint suppliers over the years; (2) the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-u.s. suppliers of paper; (3) an increase in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors; (4) failure to maintain the company current consumption levels; and (5) the inability to maintain the company existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers. any increase in the cost of newsprint, undersupply or supply chain disruption could have an adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. 32 table of contents damage, failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities that the company pay-tv business depends upon to distribute its programming could adversely affect the company business, results of operations and financial condition. the company pay-tv business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. the company distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks, and the company also uses studio and transmitter facilities. transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. these events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the company customers. the company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. instead, the company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. however, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. the company is subject to payment processing risk which could lead to adverse effects on the company business and results of operations. the company customers pay for its products and services using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and through direct carrier and partner billing. the company relies on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, any failures to comply with, or changes to, rules or regulations concerning payment processing, loss of payment or billing partners and/or disruptions or failures in, or fraudulent use of or access to, payment processing systems or payment products, the company results of operations could be adversely impacted and it could suffer reputational harm. furthermore, if the company is unable to maintain its chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and its card approval rate may be impacted. the termination of the company ability to process payments on any major payment method would adversely affect its business and results of operations. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company business. in a variety of the company businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. the market price of the company stock may fluctuate significantly. the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the company quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company operating results; (3) success or failure of the company business strategy; (4) the company ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting 33 table of contents standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (14) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions. certain of the company directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in fox corporation ( fox ), and/or because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of fox, which may result in the diversion of certain corporate opportunities to fox. certain of the company directors and executive officers own shares of fox common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company executive chairman and co-chairman of fox, and lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as the company co-chairman and chairman and chief executive officer of fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and fox may agree to implement, the company and fox agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company amended and restated by-laws acknowledge that the company directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of fox and certain of its affiliates. the company amended and restated by-laws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company amended and restated by-laws) to fox instead of the company. this could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to fox instead of the company. certain provisions of the company restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and delaware law, the company third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers, and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; 34 table of contents special stockholders meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; vacancies on the board of directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. in addition, in connection with the separation, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in june 2014, june 2015 and again in june 2018. pursuant to the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the company common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company class b common stock immediately following the separation. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. the rights expire on june 18, 2021, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 5, 2019, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company class b common stock and less than one percent of the company class a common stock as of august 5, 2019. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company class b common stock as of august 5, 2019. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 73 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates, stock prices and credit. when deemed appropriate, the company uses derivative financial instruments such as cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures. the primary market risks managed by the company through the use of derivative instruments include: foreign currency exchange rate risk: arising primarily through foxtel debt group borrowings denominated in u.s. dollars; and interest rate risk: arising from fixed and floating rate foxtel debt group borrowings. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. the following sections provide quantitative information on the company exposure to foreign currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other relevant market risks. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. operations. because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years. the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2019 and 2018: u.s. dollars australian dollars british pound sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 revenues 39 % 41 % 16 % operating and selling, general and administrative expenses 40 % 38 % 17 % fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 revenues 43 % 34 % 18 % operating and selling, general and administrative expenses 44 % 31 % 19 % based on the year ended june 30, 2019, a one cent change in each of the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $58 million and $12 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately $12 million and $1 million, respectively, on an annual basis. 73 table of contents derivatives and hedging as a result of the transaction, the company consolidated foxtel portfolio of debt and derivative instruments. as of june 30, 2019, the foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is australian dollars, had approximately $575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in u.s. dollars. the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars. foxtel utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to interest and principal payments on its u.s. dollar denominated debt. the total notional value of these cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were approximately a$400 million and a$100 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2019. foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to u.s. dollar payments for license fees. the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was $9 million as of june 30, 2019. in addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the company also uses certain derivatives not designated as accounting hedges to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk. these are referred to as economic hedges. the total notional value of these cross-currency interest rate derivatives classified as economic hedges was $75 million as of june 30, 2019. some of the derivative instruments in place may create volatility during the fiscal year as they are marked-to-market according to accounting rules and may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impact on the underlying transactions are realized. the table below provides further details of the sensitivity of the company derivative financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk as of june 30, 2019 (in millions): notional value fair value sensitivity from adverse 10% change in foreign exchange rates sensitivity from adverse 10% change in interest rates foreign currency derivatives us$ 9 $ 1 $ (1 ) n/a cross currency interest rate swaps a$ 575 139 (49 ) $ 2 interest rate derivatives a$ 700 (20 ) n/a (1 ) any resulting changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions (primarily u.s. dollar denominated liabilities) impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates. the ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle. interest rate risk the company current financing arrangements and facilities include approximately $650 million of outstanding fixed-rate debt and approximately $800 million of outstanding variable-rate bank facilities, before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (see note 9 borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). fixed and variable-rate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates. a change in the market interest rate or yield of fixed-rate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt, while a change in the market interest rate of variable-rate debt will impact interest expense, as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt. in connection with these borrowings, foxtel has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap u.s. dollar denominated fixed rate interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate payments. as discussed above, foxtel utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its u.s. dollar denominated debt. the company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to 74 table of contents swap australian dollar denominated variable interest rate payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rate payments. as of june 30, 2019, the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately a$700 million. refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk. stock prices the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. upon adoption of asu 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, any changes in fair value of the company common stock investments are recognized in the statement of operations. these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $74 million as of june 30, 2019. a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in income of approximately $7 million before tax. credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and,

watch nrl and watch afl, subscription services that provide live streaming and on-demand replays of national rugby league and australian football league matches internationally. foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue. foxtel's business generally is not highly seasonal, though results can fluctuate due to the timing and mix of its local and international sports programming, as expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information regarding certain key performance indicators for foxtel. foxtel competes primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional free to air ( fta ) tv operators in australia, including the three major commercial fta networks and two major government-funded fta broadcasters, and new content providers that deliver video programming over the internet. these providers include internet protocol television, or iptv, and subscription video-on-demand, or svod, providers such as fetch tv, netflix, stan and amazon prime video; streaming services offered through digital media providers, such as youtube and facebook; as well as programmers and distributors, such as cbs, disney and the fta networks, that provide content, including smaller, lower-cost or free programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet. the company believes that foxtel's premium and exclusive content, wide array of products and services, set-top box features that enable subscribers to record, rewind, discover and watch content, its investment in on demand capability and programming and benefits through broadband bundling enable it to offer subscribers a compelling alternative to its competitors. in addition, foxtel continues to develop new features and products to improve the value proposition of its broadcast television packages and expand its subscriber base, including its iq4 set-top box, 4k ultra hd service, upgrades to its user interface to make content discovery easier and

advertising. anc competes primarily with other news providers in australia and new zealand via its subscription television channels, third party content arrangements and free domain website. its

(2) as of june 30, 2020, based on internal sources. (3) based on enhanced media metrics australia ( emma ) average monthly print readership data for the year ended march 31, 2020 and nielsen desktop, mobile and tablet audience data for march 2020. emma data incorporates more frequent sampling and combines both online usage derived from nielsen data and print usage into a single metric that removes any audience overlap. news corp australia's broad portfolio of digital properties also includes news.com.au, one of the leading general interest sites in australia that provides breaking news, finance, entertainment, lifestyle, technology and sports news and delivers an average monthly unique audience of approximately 10.3 million based on nielsen monthly total audience ratings for the year ended june 30, 2020. in addition, news corp australia owns other premier properties such as taste.com.au, a leading food and recipe site, and kidspot.com.au, a leading parenting website, as well as various other digital media assets. as of june 30, 2020, news corp australia's other assets included a 14.8% interest in ht&amp;e limited, which operates a portfolio of australian radio and outdoor media assets, and a 30.2% interest in hipages group pty ltd., which operates a leading on-demand home improvement services marketplace. news uk news uk publishes the sun , the sun on sunday , the times and the sunday times, which are leading newspapers in the u.k that together accounted for approximately one-third of all national newspaper sales as of june 30, 2020. the sun is the most read national paid print news brand in the u.k., and the times and the sunday times are the most read national newspapers in the u.k. quality market. together, across print and digital, these brands now reach 77% of adult news readers in the u.k., or approximately 41 million people, based on pamco data for the year ended march 31, 2020. news uk's newspapers (except some saturday and sunday supplements) are printed at news uk's world-class printing facilities in england, scotland and ireland. in addition to revenue from advertising, circulation and subscription sales for its print and digital products, news uk generates revenue by providing third party printing services through these facilities and is one of the largest contract printers in the u.k. news uk also distributes content through its digital platforms, including its websites, thesun.co.uk, thetimes.co.uk and thesundaytimes.co.uk, as well as mobile and tablet apps. in addition, news uk has assembled a portfolio of complementary ancillary product offerings, including betting and gaming products. the following table provides information regarding news uk's news portfolio: print average issue readership (1) average daily paid print circulation (2) paid subscribers (3) monthly global unique users (5) the sun (mon sat) 2,257,000 1,093,861 n/a 133 million the sun on sunday 1,918,000 934,247 n/a the times (mon sat) 846,000 322,117 151,000 (print) (4) 335,000 (digital) n/a the sunday times 1,504,000 609,162 220,000 (print) (4) 336,000 (digital) n/a 10 table of contents ________________________ (1) based on publishers audience measurement company ( pamco ) data for the 12 months ended march 31, 2020.

(5) includes aggregate unique users accessing websites and mobile device and tablet apps based on google analytics data for the month ended june 30, 2020. see part i. business explanatory note regarding certain metrics. new york post nyp holdings ( nyp ) is the publisher of the new york post (the post ), nypost.com, pagesix.com, decider.com and related mobile and tablet apps and social media channels. the post is the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the u.s., with a focus on coverage of the new york metropolitan area. the post provides a variety of general interest content ranging from breaking news to business analysis, and is known in particular for its comprehensive sports coverage, famous headlines and its iconic page six section, an authority on celebrity news. the print version of the post is primarily distributed in new york, where it is printed at its bronx printing facility, as well as throughout the northeast, florida and california, where it uses dow jones's printing facilities and third party printers. for the three months ended june 30, 2020, average weekday circulation based on internal sources, including mobile and tablet app digital editions, was 396,261. in addition, the post digital network, which includes nypost.com, pagesix.com and decider.com, reached approximately 177.9 million unique users on average each month during the quarter ended june 30, 2020 according to google analytics. see part i. business explanatory note regarding certain metrics for information regarding the calculation of unique users. the news media segment's newspapers, magazines, digital publications, radio stations and podcasts generally face competition from similar sources, and compete on similar bases, as the consumer products within the dow jones segment, particularly in their respective operating geographies. see item 1. business business overview dow jones above for further information. other the other segment includes the company's general corporate overhead expenses, corporate strategy group and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters. governmental regulation general various aspects of the company's activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company's products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the company's interests. australian media regulation the company's subscription television interests are subject to australia's regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry, including the australian broadcasting services act 1992 (cth) (the broadcasting services act ) and the telecommunications act 1997 (cth) (the telecommunications act ) and associated codes. the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority. key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions currently under the anti-siphoning' provisions of the broadcasting services act, subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the australian population or the rights are held by one of australia's two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) other parts of the broadcasting services act that may impact the company's ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. foxtel is also subject to various consumer protection regimes under the telecommunications act and associated codes, which apply to foxtel as a telecommunications service provider. 11 table of contents data privacy and security the company's business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. for example, in the u.s., certain of the company's websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the children's online privacy protection act of 1998, which prohibits the collection of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. in addition, the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. more state and local governments are also expanding, enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. for example, the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ), which went into effect on january 1, 2020, established certain transparency rules and puts greater restrictions on how the company can collect, use and share personal information of california residents. similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates, including the european union, the u.k. and australia. for example, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union, and the u.k. adopted the data protection act of 2018 (the uk dpa ), implementing the gdpr . fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25, 2018, the gdpr and the uk dpa expand the regulation of the collection, processing, use, sharing and security of personal data, contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthen the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, require mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increase maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million euros or 17 million pounds, as applicable, or 4% of an entity's worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication (e-privacy) directive with a regulation to, among other things, amend the current directive's rules on the use of cookies and end-user consent. in july 2020, the european court of justice invalidated the privacy shield, one of the legal mechanisms for the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states. the company relies on the privacy shield framework for one business unit operating an advertising exchange, and certain of the company's service providers also rely on the privacy shield. as a result, the company will need to put in place, and work with some of its third party service providers to implement, alternative legal mechanisms for the affected cross-border personal data transfers. the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data, including the european union standard contractual clauses, are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms, and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted, could cause the company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services. in australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. industry participants in the u.s., europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the united states and internationally. moreover, data privacy and security laws vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions and may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the company's data privacy and security compliance programs. u.k. press regulation as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press, a press recognition panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. once approved by 12 table of contents the press recognition panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. in addition to the press recognition panel, certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is commenced, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. press regulator impress was recognized as an approved regulator by the press recognition panel on october 25, 2016. however, publications representing the majority of the industry in the u.k., including news uk, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso, in september 2014. ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel. ipso has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. ipso oversees the editors' code of practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors' code of practice and levy fines of up to 1 million. ipso has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members, including the company's newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. u.k. radio broadcasting regulation the company's radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. intellectual property the company's intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. these licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the national rugby league, australian football league, cricket australia, v8 supercars, formula one, football federation australia, australian rugby union and other broadcasting rights described in note 17 to the financial statements; (2) licenses from various third parties, including arris, of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the company's pay-tv business; (3) the trademark license for the realtor.com website address, as well as the realtor trademark (the nar license ); and (4) the trademark licenses for the use of fox formative trademarks used in the company's pay-tv business in australia (the fox licenses ). in addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. the company derives value and revenue from its intellectual property assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-tv services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to other television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties. the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign territories. to protect these assets, the company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. however, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. policing unauthorized use of the company's products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company's intellectual property. the company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. the company also seeks to limit such threat by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. however, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. therefore, the company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. 13 table of contents third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company's intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company's operations. raw materials as a major publisher of newspapers, magazines and books, the company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. in order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the company's paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. the company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. employees as of june 30, 2020, the company had approximately 23,500 employees, of whom approximately 7,000 were located in the u.s., 4,500 were located in the u.k. and 8,500 were located in australia. of the company's employees, approximately 5,000 were represented by various employee unions. the contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. the company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. explanatory note regarding certain metrics unique users for purposes of this annual report, the company counts unique users the first time an individual accesses a product's website using a browser during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses a product's mobile or tablet app using a mobile or tablet device during a calendar month. if the user accesses more than one of a product's desktop websites, mobile websites, mobile apps and/or tablet apps, the first access to each such website or app is counted as a separate unique user. in addition, users accessing a product's websites through different browsers, users who clear their browser cache at any time and users who access a product's websites and apps through different devices are also counted as separate unique users. for a group of products such as wsjdn, a user accessing different products within the group is counted as a separate unique user for each product accessed. broadcast subscribers broadcast subscribers consist of residential subscribers and commercial subscribers, which are calculated as described below. residential subscribers total number of residential subscribers represents total residential subscribers to the company's pay-tv services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships. commercial subscribers commercial subscribers for the company's pay-tv business are calculated as residential equivalent business units, which are derived by dividing total recurring revenue from these subscribers by an estimated average broadcast arpu which is held constant through the year. total number of commercial subscribers represents total commercial subscribers to the company's pay-tv services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships. broadcast arpu the company calculates broadcast arpu for its pay-tv business by dividing broadcast package revenues for the period, net of customer credits, promotions and other discounts, by average cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by the number of months in the period. average cable and satellite residential subscribers, or average broadcast subscribers, for a given period is calculated by first adding the beginning and ending cable and satellite residential subscribers for each month in the period and dividing by two and then adding each of those monthly average subscriber numbers and dividing by the number of months in the period. 14 table of contents broadcast subscriber churn the company calculates broadcast subscriber churn for its pay-tv business by dividing the total number of disconnected cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period, net of reconnects and transfers, by the average broadcast subscribers for the period, calculated as described above. this amount is then divided by the number of days in the period and multiplied by 365 days to present churn on an annual basis. paid subscribers a paid subscriber to the company's ott services is one for which the company recognized subscription revenue. a subscriber ceases to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. paid subscribers excludes customers receiving service for no charge under certain new subscriber promotions. item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating the company and its common stock. any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the company's business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the company's common stock. the ongoing novel coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and other similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. the ongoing covid-19 outbreak and other similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises, and the resulting responses of governments, businesses and consumers, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. the covid-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of unprecedented and wide-ranging measures by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter-in-place and other social distancing orders, event cancellations, travel restrictions, school shutdowns and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread have, in turn, created significant economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption and have subjected the company's businesses to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following: lower revenue and profitability . advertising revenues have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely impacted by the recent economic downturn resulting from the covid-19 pandemic and reduced spending by advertisers, particularly in the travel, retail, entertainment and real estate industries. business curtailments, closures and other operational changes and shelter-in-place orders have also caused, and may continue to cause, a decline in, among other things, new listing and other real estate revenues, sales of print books and newspapers, live journalism event revenues and commercial subscription revenues and new subscriber acquisitions at the subscription video services segment. subscription revenues from broadcast and kayo subscribers in the subscription video services segment have also been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the cancellation or postponement of sports events for which the company has broadcast rights and other disruptions in the creation and availability of film and television programming caused by covid-19. in addition, profitability in future periods may be adversely impacted even though some previously postponed events have restarted, as the company has resumed recognizing programming amortization expense for those events but may not generate sufficient incremental subscription and advertising revenues to offset these costs and compensate for prior losses. it is possible in some cases that revenue and/or profitability may not return to pre-pandemic levels. while the company has seen growth in some areas of its business during the covid-19 pandemic, including digital subscribers at its newspaper businesses and e-book sales at its book publishing segment, driven in part by the current news environment and other pandemic-related circumstances, this growth may not be sustainable, particularly in the event of a prolonged economic downturn. disruptions in the company's supply chain . the company's supply chain, including its printing facilities, as well as the printing, manufacturing and other facilities and operations of its third-party suppliers and vendors, may be disrupted by facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages and changes in operating procedures. similarly, the covid-19 pandemic may negatively affect the company's distribution and logistics providers' ability to operate or increase their operating costs. economic disruption and uncertainty may also cause the company's suppliers, vendors and distribution and logistics providers to experience financial difficulties and result in volatility in paper and other input 15 table of contents costs. these supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on the company's ability to meet consumer demand and could result in an increase in its costs of production and distribution. efforts to address and mitigate the adverse impacts of covid-19 may not be successful and may result in the incurrence of costs and/or negatively impact the company's revenues . the company is devoting substantial time and resources to addressing and mitigating the effect of covid-19. these efforts, including operational changes, measures to reduce variable costs and the implementation of cost-savings initiatives across its businesses, may divert resources and the attention of the company's senior management from other aspects of the company's operations, including previously planned initiatives. operational changes and cost containment measures such as workforce reductions and the shift to digital-only editions for certain local australian newspapers have caused, and may continue to cause, the company to incur restructuring and other costs, while business support measures, including re-list and re-upgrade offers for new listings and price concessions at the digital real estate services segment, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, revenues. there can be no assurance that any efforts taken by the company to address and/or mitigate the impact of covid-19 will be successful or substantially offset declines in revenues. adverse workforce impacts . the company's operations may be adversely affected if a substantial number of employees or key personnel become ill or are quarantined as a result of covid-19. the company has instituted remote working arrangements for a substantial majority of its employees in order to protect their well-being and comply with applicable regulations and guidance. however, there is no certainty that such measures will mitigate the risks posed by covid-19, and an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain the company's business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks or risks to the effectiveness of the company's internal controls, and adversely affect the company's productivity and ability to manage its business and perform critical functions. the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic, including the extent of adverse impacts on the company's business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, will depend on, among other things, the severity, duration, spread and any reoccurrence of the pandemic, the impact of governmental actions and business and consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak and prevent or limit any reoccurrence, the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. the evolving and uncertain nature of this situation makes it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of the company's business, including the supply and demand for the company's products and services, its cash flows, its advertising revenues, the impact on the delivery of programming and associated payments and the collectability of receivables. however, the covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the company's business and results of operations, as described above, and could have a material adverse impact on the company's business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, particularly over the near to medium term. any such adverse impact or any continued weakness in economic conditions and/or further disruptions in the global financial and capital markets could in turn make it more difficult for certain of the company's operating subsidiaries to comply with the financial and other covenants relating to their existing indebtedness, impact the availability and cost of additional financing, lead to significant and adverse exchange rate fluctuations, result in additional impairments in the value of the company's assets and additional valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets or cause further declines in the company's stock price. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic will amplify many of the other risk factors disclosed elsewhere in this item 1a. risk factors. the company operates in a highly competitive business environment, and its success depends on its ability to compete effectively. the company faces significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment, including both traditional and new content providers. this competition continues to intensify as a result of rapid changes in technologies, platforms and business models, and the company may be adversely affected if consumers or customers migrate to other alternatives. for example, advertising and circulation revenues at the company's newspaper businesses may continue to decline, reflecting consumers' increasing reliance on a variety of content providers and platforms, including search engines, news aggregation websites, social media networks and customized news feeds, for the delivery of news and information, often without charge. in addition, due to the increased availability of high-speed internet access and developments in content distribution platforms that enable streaming and downloading of programming, consumers are now more readily able to watch internet-delivered content through an increasing variety of providers. these providers include iptv and svod services, such as fetch tv, netflix, stan and amazon prime video, streaming services offered through digital media providers, such as youtube and facebook, as well as programmers and distributors, such as cbs, disney and the fta networks, that provide content, including smaller, lower-cost or free programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet. the increasing number of choices available to consumers for 16 table of contents video content, many of which provide original or exclusive content, has caused some of the subscribers to the company's pay-tv services to disconnect their services, downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages or purchase certain services from other providers, and this may continue. this trend has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, both the company's subscription revenue and, in turn, advertisers' willingness to purchase television advertising from the company, as well as increase subscriber acquisition, retention and other costs. in order to compete effectively, the company must differentiate and distinguish its brands and their associated products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer and customer needs, tastes and behaviors, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. for example, the company relies on brand awareness and acceptance of the high-quality differentiated content in its newspapers, book titles, pay-tv programming and radio stations, as well as its wide array of digital products and services, in order to retain and grow its audiences, consumers and subscribers. however, consumer tastes change frequently and are difficult to predict, and when faced with a multitude of choices, consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source, quality or reliability. online traffic and product purchases are also driven by internet search results, referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores. search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that are changed frequently by the owner or operator, and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users. any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the company's businesses, including those affecting how the company's content, apps and products are prioritized, displayed and monetized, could impede the company's ability to compete effectively by significantly decreasing traffic to the company's digital properties, lowering advertiser interest in those properties, increasing costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lowering product sales and subscriptions or otherwise adversely affecting the company's business. the company expects to continue to pursue new strategic initiatives and develop new products and services in order to remain competitive, such as its ott strategy and the migration of subscribers from cable to satellite or internet delivery at its pay-tv business and its referral-based model for its u.s. digital real estate business. the company has incurred, and may in the future be required to incur, significant capital expenditures, marketing and other costs in order to implement these strategies and develop these new products and services, which may be dilutive to its earnings. there can be no assurance these strategic initiatives, products and services will be successful in the manner or time period the company expects or that it will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits it expects to achieve. the failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, the company is targeting a different demographic with its streaming services, which are offered at a lower price point than its traditional broadcast subscription packages. however, if instead those streaming offerings cause broadcast subscribers to disconnect their services or downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages, the company's revenues may be materially and adversely affected. some of the company's current and potential competitors may have greater resources, fewer regulatory burdens, better competitive positions in certain areas, greater operating capabilities, greater access to sources of content, data, technology or other services or strategic relationships and/or easier access to financing, which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology, consumer and customer needs and preferences and market conditions. continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the company operates may increase these advantages, including through greater scale, financial leverage and/or access to content, data, technology and other offerings. if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the company must respond to evolving technologies and changes in consumer and customer needs and behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products and services in order to remain competitive. technology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer and customer needs, behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company's products and services less valuable. for example, enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels have led to alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, often without charge, distribution of video content to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile and other devices via streaming and downloading and digital distribution models for books. these developments have driven consumers to expect more control over the convenience and price of content consumption and may, in turn, continue to reduce the demand for the company's newspapers, television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay for such products and services. consumption of the company's content on new third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates. in addition, other technological developments, such as those allowing consumers to browse incognito or skip, fast forward through or block advertisements or otherwise time-shift viewing, may cause changes in consumer 17 table of contents behavior that reduce the company's ability to serve advertising based on user data and behaviors or at all, which would adversely affect the attractiveness of the company's offerings to advertisers. technological developments have in many cases also increased competition by significantly lowering barriers to entry. for example, content providers are now able to compete with the company's pay-tv business via direct-to-consumer offerings, as internet streaming capabilities have enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure. other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company, often at a lower cost. this trend may drive down the price consumers and customers are willing to spend on the company's products and services. additional digital distribution channels, such as online retailers and digital marketplaces, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the company's business models, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing. the company must continue to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to ensure its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers, are delivered in the manner in which consumers and customers wish to consume them and are offered at competitive prices. the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer and customer needs and behavior, and to attract and retain employees with the necessary skill sets and knowledge base. for example, the company has made, and expects to continue to make investments and incur costs in its pay-tv business as it continues to develop and improve its ott services, including its kayo sports streaming service, foxtel now and its recently-launched binge entertainment streaming service. the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process, and there is a risk the company may not be able to develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner and its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including new product and service offerings, may not be accepted by consumers and customers, generate sufficient revenues to be profitable or be as profitable as existing product and service offerings. the company's failure to respond to and develop new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, products and services to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer and customer needs and preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base or its advertisers to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its business, asset values, results of operations and financial condition. a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company's newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly. the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, digital media properties, cable channels and other pay-tv programming and radio stations. the company's ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) demand for the company's products and services, (2) audience fragmentation, (3) digital advertising trends, (4) its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers, (5) general economic and business conditions, (6) demographics of the customer base, (7) advertising rates, (8) advertising effectiveness and (9) maintaining its brand strength and reputation. demand for the company's products and services depends upon the company's ability to differentiate those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behaviors and is evaluated based on a variety of metrics. for example, circulation levels for the company's newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates. for the company's digital media properties, advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand, particularly demand generated through new platforms, may lead to under-measurement and, in turn, lower advertising pricing and spending. the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content, and the ability of digital advertising offerings to deliver targeted advertising promptly, has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms. large digital platforms in particular, such as facebook, google and amazon, which have extensive audience reach, audience data and targeting capabilities, have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market in recent years, and the company expects this trend to continue. the shift to digital media has significantly impacted the company's print advertising revenues, which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years. new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are also increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. in 18 table of contents addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. as a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure. consequently, the company's digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. the digital advertising market also continues to undergo changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure. new third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. the company's digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies such as google's ad manager which, if interrupted or meaningfully changed, or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure, could adversely impact advertising revenues. in addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology and policies that adversely affect the company's ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness of its advertising, including blocking, changing the location of, or obscuring, the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices, browsing incognito, blocking or deleting cookies and/or the phase-out of browser support for third party cookies, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. as the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the company's ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, collect and leverage better user data, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content, and video and mobile advertising, and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company's platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings. the company's print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions, including consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation, advertisers' budgeting and buying patterns, which tend to be cyclical, as well as federal, state and local election and other news cycles. natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics (including covid-19) and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism have led and could continue to lead to greater economic uncertainty and reduced spending by advertisers. in addition, certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company's advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. some of these sectors, such as retail, are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from business curtailments and closures and other measures implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic, as well as increased online competition. a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers' spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may reduce the company's overall advertising revenue. while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. reduced demand for the company's offerings, a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company's customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the company's businesses and assets, results of operations and financial condition. the inability to obtain and retain sports, entertainment and other programming rights and content could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company's operating businesses, and costs could also increase upon renewal. competition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense, and the success of certain of the company's operating businesses, including its pay-tv business, depends on, among other things, their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof, such as music rights, that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices. the pay-tv industry, including the company's pay-tv business, has experienced higher programming costs due to, among other things, (1) increases imposed by sports, entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts; (2) the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and svod programming; and (3) increased competition from other digital media companies, including svod providers, for the rights to popular or exclusive content. certain of the company's operating businesses, including its pay-tv business, are party to contracts for sports, entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties, including professional sports leagues and teams, television and motion picture producers and other content providers. these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms, and as they expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought. in the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire, the financial and other terms of these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the company's control, such as changes in the company's bargaining power or in the industry, and in order to retain or extend such rights, the company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs. furthermore, third parties may 19 table of contents outbid the company for those rights and/or for any new programming offerings. in addition, as other content providers develop their own competing services, they may be unwilling to provide the company with access to certain content. for example, professional sports leagues or teams, as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs and disney, have created and may continue to create their own direct-to-consumer offerings. further, consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the company. the loss of rights may adversely affect the breadth or quality of the company's content offerings, including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers or audiences, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. in addition, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal, escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. the long-term nature of some of the company's content commitments may also limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, business and economic conditions (including covid-19) and the market segments in which it operates. weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company's business. the u.s. and global economies are experiencing economic and market weakness and uncertainty as a result of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic as well as trade disputes between a number of countries. these conditions have resulted in, among other things, a tightening of, and in some cases more limited access to, the credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a decline in the real estate market. such weakness and uncertainty and associated market disruptions have often led to broader, prolonged economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures, lower demand for the company's products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. any continued or recurring economic weakness is likely to have a similar impact on the company's business and reduce its circulation and subscription, advertising, real estate, consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses. the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks, including specific australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 39% of its fiscal 2020 revenues from australia. as a result, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market, including, for example, weakness in the australian residential real estate market which has led, and may continue to lead, to lower listing volumes at rea group. the company also generated approximately 13% of its fiscal 2020 revenues from the u.k., which continues to experience political, regulatory, economic and market uncertainty following its exit from the european union in january 2020, commonly referred to as brexit. the u.k. is now in a transition period until december 31, 2020 during which the e.u. and the u.k. will negotiate future arrangements regarding trade, finance and other key matters. while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict, it could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary, political and regulatory landscape, lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union, result in the diminishment or elimination of barrier-free access between the u.k. and other european union member states and additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company's businesses in the u.k. and elsewhere. in addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. although the company believes that its cash on hand, operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets, including the company's revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for at least the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the company's liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing. the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions, investments and divestitures that introduce significant risks and uncertainties. in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the company's senior management from the company's operations, (6) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (7) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (8) in the case of foreign acquisitions 20 table of contents and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (9) liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments, (10) in some cases, increased regulation and (11) in some cases, lower liquidity as a result of the use of cash or incurrence of debt to fund such acquisition or investment. if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company's existing businesses, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets. the company has also divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets. divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. these include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to its business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees, difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business and retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt. as of june 30, 2020, the foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is australian dollars, had approximately $350 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in u.s. dollars. the company's policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable. however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements. in addition, the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company's reporting currency, primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. since the company's financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the company's earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into u.s. dollars for inclusion in the company's consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. the economic volatility and uncertainty caused by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has led to significant and adverse exchange rate fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and both the australian dollar and the british pound sterling in recent periods. in addition, exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to continued economic and political uncertainty in the u.k. as a result of its failure to secure agreements with the european union regarding trade, finance and other key matters prior to brexit. the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, reputational damage or other harm to the company's business. network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the company's network management, are important to its business activities and contain the company's proprietary, confidential and sensitive business information, including personal data of its customers and personnel. the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and cloud-based systems and services that support a variety of business operations. network and information systems-related events affecting the company's systems, or those of third parties upon which the company's business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or state-sponsored or other groups, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power and internet outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the company's business and/or loss, corruption, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company's disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events. unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the company's employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the company's systems, facilities or data, or those of third parties with whom the company does business. in addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or 21 table of contents software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the company's network and information systems or compromise information security. in recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies' network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. activities of this nature may also increase during times of instability, including during the covid-19 pandemic, as online activity increases and/or operational changes such as remote working are implemented in response. as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the company's digital businesses expand. the company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the company to date, individually or in the aggregate. however, there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity threat or incident that has a material adverse effect in the future. while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss or corruption, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. additionally, it may be difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time. any network and information systems-related events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. while the company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the company's systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the company's systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, including degradation or disruption of service, equipment damage, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, audience, advertisers, business partners or revenues and other financial losses. if any such failure, compromise, breach, interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the company's information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal and credit card data, as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the company's business, including its intellectual property, the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy, as well as private individual or class action lawsuits. the company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies and/or regulators (including the appropriate eu supervisory authority) about any actual or perceived data security breach, as well as the individuals who are affected by any such incident, within strict time periods. in addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in the company's systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact the company's brand and reputation and materially affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges. as a result of adverse developments in the company's industry and challenging market conditions (including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic), the company has recognized, and may in the future recognize, impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the company's results of operations and, in the case of cash restructuring charges, its financial condition. impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the company's taxes, including its ability to deduct certain interest costs. the company's management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company's cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment. in accordance with gaap, the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including newspaper mastheads, publishing imprints, radio broadcast licenses, trademarks and trade names, publishing rights and customer relationships, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, credit and capital markets or the economy generally (including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic) and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. for example, the adverse effects of the covid-19 pandemic or any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue or subscribers, the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights and/or consumer acceptance of new products, including the company's new svod services, could lead to a downward revision in the 22 table of contents fair value of certain reporting units. any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required, and any such charge could be material to the company's reported results of operations. for example, in fiscal 2020, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1,690 million, primarily due to a $931 million write-down of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at its foxtel reporting unit as a result of lower expected broadcast subscribers and the expected negative impact of covid-19 on advertising, ott and commercial subscriber revenues in the near term, $410 million of write-downs related to news america marketing, including $175 million related to the reclassification to assets held for sale, and $292 million in impairments of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets identified during the company's annual impairment assessment. in addition, as of june 30, 2020, the company had approximately $908 million of goodwill that is at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the corresponding reporting units equaled their respective carrying values. the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends. there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it, and the leverage of its foxtel operating subsidiaries could limit the ability of those subsidiaries to access the credit and capital markets and have other adverse effects. from time to time the company expects to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness. although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the company's revolving credit facility, will permit the company to finance its operations for at least the next 12 months on acceptable terms and conditions, the company's access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. the company's foxtel operating subsidiaries have outstanding indebtedness that could limit or prevent them from incurring additional debt or refinancing or otherwise extending the maturities of their existing debt and reduce their flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including those arising from the pandemic. as of june 30, 2020, the foxtel operating subsidiaries' total outstanding indebtedness was $965 million (excluding related party debt), with maturities ranging from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025. factors impacting the company's ability to access the credit and capital markets include, but are not limited to the following, a number of which have been adversely impacted by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic as disclosed elsewhere in this item 1a. risk factors : (1) the financial and operational performance of the company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) the company's credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (3) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents (collectively, the debt documents ); (4) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (5) the state of the economy. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it. the company's consolidated debt could also have other adverse effects. a portion of the outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates, which exposes the company to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. if interest rates increase, the applicable debt service obligations will increase, which could reduce available cash flow and make it more difficult to make scheduled debt payments and/or limit the amount of cash available for operations, including investments and capital expenditures. although the company hedges a portion of the exposure to these interest rate movements, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements. in addition, the foxtel operating subsidiaries' outstanding debt documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility. subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict or prohibit these operating subsidiaries from, among other things, undertaking certain transactions, disposing of certain properties or assets (including subsidiary stock), merging or consolidating with any other person, making financial accommodation available, giving guarantees, entering into certain other financing arrangements, creating or permitting certain liens, engaging in transactions with affiliates, making repayments of certain other loans and undergoing fundamental business changes. these instruments also generally include financial covenants requiring the foxtel operating subsidiaries to maintain specified net debt to ebitda and net interest coverage ratios. in the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any of the foxtel operating subsidiaries' debt documents, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable debt documents, which could result in a default under other outstanding debt documents and could have a material adverse impact on the company's business, results of operation and financial condition. the company's business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation. various aspects of the company's activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company's products and services are produced or distributed, and 23 table of contents changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. in addition, laws and regulations vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply. the company's australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general. this includes: anti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-tv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches) unless: national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event; the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the australian population; or the rights are held by one of australia's two major government-funded broadcasters; other parts of the broadcasting services act that regulate ownership interests and control of australian media organizations. such legislation may have an impact on the company's ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities; and the telecommunications act and associated codes, which apply various consumer protection regimes to foxtel as a telecommunications service provider. the company's business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have implications for how such data is managed. many of these laws and regulations are increasingly complex and continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. moreover, data privacy and security laws may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with these laws and regulations could be costly and resource-intensive, require the company to change its business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the company's business in a manner adverse to its business operations, including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted, data-driven advertising offerings. the company's failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, or as a result of a compromise, breach or interruption of the company's systems by a third party, could result in exposure to enforcement by u.s. federal, state or local or foreign governments or private parties, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. examples of such laws include the european union's gdpr and the uk dpa, each of which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and the u.k., respectively, and significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance, and california's ccpa, which went into effect on january 1, 2020 and established certain transparency rules and puts greater restrictions on the collection, use and sharing of personal information of california residents. see governmental regulation data privacy and security for more information. finally, because some of the company's products and services are available on the internet, it may be subject to laws or regulations exposing it to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence. in addition, the company's newspaper publishing businesses in the u.k. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the u.k. press. following the inquiry, the u.k. government established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body. publishers who are not members of an approved regulator, including the company, may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and, if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is commenced, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. the majority of the u.k. press, including news uk, has established an alternative regulator, the independent press standards organisation, or ipso. ipso, which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel, has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the u.k. these powers, which include the ability to impose fines of up to 1 million for systemic breaches of ipso's editor's code of practice, may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. 24 table of contents the company's radio stations in the u.k. and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. although the company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. non-compliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company's business practices and operating results. from time to time, the company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property, employment and other matters. see item 3. legal proceedings and note 17 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters. the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company's results of operations or financial condition as well as the company's ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. in addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. the company is subject to taxation in u.s. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-u.s. jurisdictions, including australia and the u.k. the company's effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the company's profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company's deferred tax assets. the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances if, among other things, adverse economic conditions, including those caused by covid-19, negatively impact the company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets. evaluating and estimating the company's tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the company's tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company's tax returns or positions taken by the company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company. although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. as a result, the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. the organization for economic cooperation and development continues its program of work to develop a consensus solution in relation to its base erosion and profit shifting action 1, addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy. the outcome of this program may change various aspects of the existing framework under which the company's tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. several foreign jurisdictions have separately introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services. while the unilateral digital services taxes in force in countries to date, including the u.k., have had limited impact on the company's overall tax obligations, the company continues to monitor proposals for new digital services taxes in various countries. there is limited guidance about the applicability of these new taxes to the company's businesses and significant uncertainty as to what type of digital services will be deemed in scope. if these new taxes are applied to the company's revenue in these foreign jurisdictions, it could have an adverse impact on its business and financial performance. theft of the company's content, including digital piracy and signal theft, may decrease revenue and adversely affect the company's business and profitability. the company's success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content, and theft of its brands, programming, digital content, books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content. developments in technology, including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs, increase the 25 table of contents threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream, duplicate and widely distribute pirated material, including from other less-regulated countries into the company's primary markets. covid-19 may increase incentives and opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways if the resulting economic weakness persists and/or as consumers spend more time at home. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. however, these efforts may be costly and are not always successful, particularly as infringers continue to develop tools that undermine security features and enable the cloaking of online identities, and the company cannot ensure that it will be able to reduce or control theft of its content. the proliferation of unauthorized use of the company's content may have an adverse effect on its business and profitability by reducing the revenue that the company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. moreover, protection of the company's intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed and enforced. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company's rights, or if existing laws are changed or not effectively enforced, the company's ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. in addition, the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated could make it more difficult for the company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could, in turn, negatively impact its value and further increase the company's enforcement costs. the company's pay-tv business depends on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain key products and services, and any reduction or interruption in the supply of these products and services or a significant increase in price could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company's pay-tv business depends on a single or limited number of third party suppliers to supply certain key products and services necessary to provide its pay-tv services. in particular, the company depends on optus to provide all of its satellite transponder capacity, and arris and technicolor are the company's sole suppliers of satellite set-top boxes and the foxtel now box, respectively. if any of these suppliers breaches or terminates its agreement with the company or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, experiences operating or financial difficulties, is unable to meet demand due to component shortages, insufficient capacity or otherwise, significantly increases the amount the company pays for necessary products or services or ceases production of any necessary product, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. in addition, telstra is the primary supplier of cable distribution capacity for the company's pay-tv programming and is also currently the exclusive provider of wholesale fixed voice and broadband services for the company's pay-tv business, as well as its primary supplier of wholesale mobile voice and broadband services and the largest reseller of its cable and satellite products. any disruption in the supply of those services or a decline in telstra's business could result in disruptions to the supply of, and/or reduce the number of subscribers for, the company's products and services, which could, in turn, adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. while the company will seek alternative sources for the products and services described above where possible and/or permissible under applicable agreements, it may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could impair its ability to timely deliver its products and services to its subscribers or operate its business. the company's international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. in its fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, approximately 59% of the company's revenues were derived outside the u.s., and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally and other risks may be heightened, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) the impact of catastrophic events in relevant jurisdictions (including natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics (including covid-19) and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism); (4) compliance with foreign tax regimes and potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (5) compliance with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements such as the gdpr; (6) compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act; (7) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; (8) compliance with local labor laws and regulations; and (9) regulatory or governmental action against the company's products and services, including censorship or other restrictions on access, expulsion of journalists or other employees and retaliatory actions, including as a result of trade and other disputes with the u.s. for example, brexit may continue to adversely affect, among other things, economic and market conditions in the u.k. 26 table of contents and the european union, create uncertainty around doing business in the u.k. and result in additional costs and compliance obligations, including with respect to tariffs and other trade barriers, data protection and transfer, tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees. events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company's international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities. the company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that contain operational and management restrictions and/or other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the company. the company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that restrict the company's ability to take specified actions and contain other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the company. for example, the company and telstra are parties to a shareholders' agreement with respect to foxtel containing certain minority protections for telstra, including standard governance provisions, as well as transfer and exit rights. the shareholders' agreement provides telstra with the right to appoint two directors to the board of foxtel, as well as board and shareholder-level veto rights over certain non-ordinary course and/or material corporate actions that may prevent foxtel from taking actions that are in the interests of the company. the shareholders' agreement also provides for (1) certain transfer restrictions, which could adversely affect the company's ability to effect such transfers and/or the prices at which those transfers may occur, and (2) exit arrangements, which could, in certain circumstances, force the company to sell its interest, subject to rights of first and, in some cases, last refusals. in addition, move, the company's digital real estate services business in the u.s., operates the realtor.com website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration. however, nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. if the operating agreement with nar is terminated, the nar license would also terminate, and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. nar would then be able to operate a realtor.com website, either by itself or with another third party. failure by the company to protect certain intellectual property and brands, or infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the company's business, results of operation and financial condition. the company's businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as licenses and other contractual arrangements, including licenses relating to sports programming rights, set-top box technology and related systems, the nar license and the fox licenses, to establish, obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses. the company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. however, the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors and suppliers will be enforced or upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the company operates or where its products are available. efforts to protect and enforce the company's intellectual property rights may be costly, and any failure by the company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect and enforce its or their intellectual property or brands, or any infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. claims of intellectual property infringement could require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms (if such agreements are available at all), require the company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it, or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property, which could in turn require the company to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. even if the company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management's attention and resources away from its business. in addition, the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims. any significant increase in newsprint costs or disruption in the company's newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels may adversely affect the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. newsprint is a significant expense for the company's newspaper publishing units. the price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and a number of factors may cause prices to increase, including: (1) the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills or the conversion of newsprint mills to other products or grades of paper, which has reduced the number of newsprint suppliers over 27 table of contents the years; (2) the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-u.s. suppliers of paper; (3) an increase in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors; (4) failure to maintain the company's current consumption levels; and (5) the inability to maintain the company's existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers. the company also relies on third party suppliers for deliveries of newsprint and printing and distribution partners to print and distribute its newspapers in some areas. financial pressures, newspaper industry economics, labor unrest, changes in laws and regulations, transportation issues or other circumstances affecting these third-party suppliers and print and distribution partners, including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, could lead to disruptions in the company's newsprint supply chain and/or reduced operations or consolidations of third-party print sites and/or distribution routes, which could increase the cost of printing and distributing the company's newspapers. any significant increase in the cost of newsprint, undersupply or significant disruptions in the newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. damage, failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities that the company's pay-tv business depends upon to distribute its programming could adversely affect the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company's pay-tv business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. the company's distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks, and the company also uses studio and transmitter facilities. transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather, power outages, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks or other similar events, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. these events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the company's customers. the company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. instead, the company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. however, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company is subject to payment processing risk which could lead to adverse effects on the company's business and results of operations. the company's customers pay for its products and services using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and through direct carrier and partner billing. the company relies on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, any failures to comply with, or changes to, rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment or billing partners and/or disruptions or failures in, or fraudulent use of or access to, payment processing systems or payment products, the company's results of operations could be adversely impacted and it could suffer reputational harm. furthermore, if the company is unable to maintain its fraud and chargeback rates at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and its card approval rate may be impacted. the termination of the company's ability to process payments on any major payment method would adversely affect its business and results of operations. labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company's business. in a variety of the company's businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company's business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins. the market price of the company's stock may fluctuate significantly. the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. the market price of the company's common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the 28 table of contents company's quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company's operating results; (3) success or failure of the company's business strategy; (4) the company's ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the company's business; (7) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or the addition or loss of significant customers; (8) announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company's ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; (14) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions; and (15) changes in the amounts and frequency of dividends or share repurchases, if any. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has amplified many of the foregoing factors and resulted in additional volatility in the company's stock price. certain fcc rules and regulations and the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the u.s. the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the common ownership of radio and television broadcast stations and the common ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers (the broadcast ownership rules ) and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest (the program access rules ). in november 2017, the fcc voted to eliminate the broadcast ownership rules, and the order became effective in february 2018. however, in september 2019, a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit (the third circuit ) issued an order vacating the fcc's order and reinstating the broadcast ownership rules. the fcc's petition for en banc review was denied in november 2019, following which a mandate reinstating the broadcast ownership rules was issued. the fcc and certain other parties filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the u.s. supreme court appealing the third circuit's decision in april 2020 and are awaiting a ruling. under the fcc's rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the murdoch family trust's ownership interest in both the company and fox would generally result in each company's businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules. consequently, the company may be restricted from taking advantage of certain acquisition or investment opportunities, including, for example, the acquisition of a newspaper in the same local market in which fox owns or operates a television station. in addition, the company agreed in the separation and distribution agreement, as amended, that if it acquires newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the u.s. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede fox's business under the broadcast ownership rules or any other federal statute or fcc rule that limits, directly or indirectly, the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations, newspapers and/or television broadcast networks, including fox's ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with such rules or statutes, then the company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules or statutes. the company also agreed not to acquire an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor, including a cable television operator, if such acquisition would subject fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject. this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules or any other federal statute or fcc rule that limits, directly or indirectly, the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations, newspapers and/or television broadcast networks, and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede fox's business. certain of the company's directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in fox corporation ( fox ), and/or because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of fox, which may result in the diversion of certain corporate opportunities to fox. certain of the company's directors and executive officers own shares of fox's common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company's officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of fox, including k. rupert murdoch, who serves as the company's executive chairman and co-chairman of fox, and lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as the company's co-chairman and chairman and chief executive officer of fox. this ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and fox. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and fox may agree to implement, the company and fox agreed that 29 table of contents officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies. the company's amended and restated by-laws acknowledge that the company's directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the company and fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of fox and certain of its affiliates. the company's amended and restated by-laws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company's amended and restated by-laws) to fox instead of the company. this could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to fox instead of the company. certain provisions of the company's restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and delaware law, the company's third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company's common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers, and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval. the company's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company's board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock. in particular, the company's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things: a dual class common equity capital structure; a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting; special stockholders' meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock; the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders' meeting; the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws; vacancies on the board of directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; certain restrictions on the transfer of the company's shares; and the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable. in addition, in connection with the separation, the company's board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in june 2014, june 2015 and again in june 2018. pursuant to the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the company's common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding class b common stock without approval of the company's board of directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the company's class b common stock immediately following the separation. the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the company's voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors. the rights expire on june 18, 2021, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company's outstanding class a common stock and approximately 38.4% of the company's class b common stock as of 30 table of contents august 3, 2020, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company's class b common stock and less than one percent of the company's class a common stock as of august 3, 2020. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company's class a common stock and approximately 39.4% of the company's class b common stock as of august 3, 2020. this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the company's board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company's class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust's influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 64 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates, stock prices and credit. when deemed appropriate, the company uses derivative financial instruments such as cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures. the primary market risks managed by the company through the use of derivative instruments include: foreign currency exchange rate risk: arising primarily through foxtel debt group borrowings denominated in u.s. dollars, payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights; and interest rate risk: arising from fixed and floating rate foxtel debt group borrowings. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. the following sections provide quantitative information on the company's exposure to foreign currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other relevant market risks. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company's u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. operations. because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities' statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company's reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years. the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2020 and 2019: u.s. dollars australian dollars british pound sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 revenues 43 % 39 % 15 % operating and selling, general and administrative expenses 44 % 36 % 16 % fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 revenues 39 % 41 % 16 % operating and selling, general and administrative expenses 40 % 38 % 17 % 64 table of contents based on the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, a one cent change in each of the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $53 million and $11 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately $10 million and $1 million, respectively, on an annual basis. derivatives and hedging as a result of the transaction, the company consolidated foxtel's portfolio of debt and derivative instruments. as of june 30, 2020, the foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is australian dollars, had approximately $350 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in u.s. dollars. the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars. foxtel utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to interest and principal payments on its u.s. dollar denominated debt. the total notional value of these cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were approximately a$280 million and a$70 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2020. foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to u.s. dollar payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights. the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was $53 million as of june 30, 2020. some of the derivative instruments in place may create volatility during the fiscal year as they are marked-to-market according to accounting rules and may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impact on the underlying transactions are realized. the table below provides further details of the sensitivity of the company's derivative financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk as of june 30, 2020 (in millions): notional value fair value sensitivity from adverse 10% change in foreign exchange rates sensitivity from adverse 10% change in interest rates foreign currency derivatives us$ 53 $ (3) $ (6) n/a cross currency interest rate swaps a$ 350 104 (43) $ interest rate derivatives a$ 300 (16) n/a any resulting changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions (primarily u.s. dollar denominated liabilities) impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates. the ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle. interest rate risk the company's current financing arrangements and facilities include $594 million of outstanding fixed-rate debt and $547 million of outstanding variable-rate bank facilities, before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (see note 9 borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). fixed and variable-rate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates. a change in the market interest rate or yield of fixed-rate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt, while a change in the market interest rate of variable-rate debt will impact interest expense, as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt. in connection with these borrowings, foxtel has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap u.s. dollar denominated fixed rate interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate payments. as discussed above, foxtel utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its u.s. dollar denominated debt. the company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to swap australian dollar denominated variable interest rate payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rate payments. as of june 30, 2020, the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately a$300 million. refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company's financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk. stock prices the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. upon adoption of asu 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, any changes in fair value of the company's common stock 65 table of contents investments are recognized in the statement of operations. these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $54 million as of june 30, 2020. a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in income of approximately $5 million before tax. credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. the company's receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30, 2020 or june 30, 2019 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the company's products and services are sold. the company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. as of june 30, 2020, the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. 66 table of contents
