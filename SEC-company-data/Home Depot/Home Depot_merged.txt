risk factors 6 risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. other factors including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. we operate in markets that are highly competitive. we compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. in each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national 6 table of contents hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. in addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations and needs and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits, and health and other insurance costs. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. we rely on third party suppliers. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. if we do not maintain the security of customer, associate or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. any significant compromise or breach of customer, associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of 7 table of contents our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, smart phones and other mobile communication devices. we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, including damage or destruction to our distribution centers, could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation. such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. healthcare reform under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. although we currently maintain an investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2011 , there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions. new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity 8 table of contents and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa") and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with fcpa and local anti-bribery law compliance, challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations. if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could be subject to fines and lawsuits. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our d-i-f-m customers through third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to

with installers of home improvement products. in addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our margins or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs,

unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, including damage or destruction to our distribution centers or weather-related events, could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and damaged reputation. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, supply chain transparency, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. healthcare reform under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as 9 table of contents well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance, challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions. new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report. 26 table of contentsrisk factors 7 risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. we operate in markets that are highly competitive. we compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. in each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. in addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our margins or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer relationships, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining high levels of customer service. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. as the housing and home improvement market continues to recover, resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels. in addition, each of our primary customer groups diy, difm and professionals have different needs and expectations. if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also evolving. customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. we have implemented programs like boss and bopis, and are piloting bodfs, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers' needs and expectations. customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. 7 table of contents further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping environment that our customers desire. failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively, to provide a compelling online presence, to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs and to differentiate the customer service experience for our three primary customer groups could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly if the economy continues to improve and employment opportunities increase. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. we discovered a data breach in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and are still in the process of determining the full extent of its impact and the impact of related government investigations and civil litigation on our results of operations, which could be material. our recent data breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems. as a result of the data breach, we are facing at least 57 civil lawsuits filed in the u.s. and canada, and other claims may be asserted on behalf of customers, payment card brands, payment card issuing banks, shareholders, or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising out of the data breach. we are also facing investigations by a number of state and federal agencies. our financial liability arising from these claims and investigations will depend on many factors, one of which is whether, at the time of the data breach, the portion of our network that handles payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry standards. another factor is whether, and if so to what extent, any fraud losses or other expenses experienced by cardholders, the payment card networks or the card issuing banks on or with respect to the payment card accounts affected by the data breach can be properly attributed to the data breach and whether and to what extent those losses and expenses would in any event be our legal responsibility. these claims and investigations may adversely affect how we operate our business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business and result in additional costs and fines. in addition, the governmental agencies investigating the data breach may seek to impose injunctive relief, which could materially increase our data security costs, adversely impact how we operate our systems and collect and use customer information, and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers. investigations of the data breach are ongoing, and we are still in the process of assessing the financial and other impacts of the data breach. it is possible that we will identify additional information that was accessed or stolen, or other unforeseen developments related to the data breach could occur, which could have a further adverse impact on our operations, financial results and reputation. if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier or company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to further litigation, enforcement actions, and reputational damage. our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers' personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our associates, our suppliers and our company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. we also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to 8 table of contents obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. however, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in additional significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. in addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business. we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, paypal, our private label credit cards and installment loan program, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. the payment card industry has set october 1, 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept emv chip card credit and debit transactions. to be able to accept all forms of emv card transactions by the target date, we are reliant on various third parties to establish the standard for such transactions, develop and test the required software, define the applicable certification standards, and certify compliance with those standards. the failure of these third parties to timely complete and deliver needed elements, or our failure to effectively and timely implement those elements once received, will impact our ability to be able to accept all types of emv card transactions by the target date, which could in turn result in increased costs associated with the liability shift. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems, as reflected in our recent data breach. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. in addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. as a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. uncertainty regarding economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. other factors beyond our control including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, manage and protect transactions and data. we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data in managing our business. for these systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. our systems and the third-party systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; 9 table of contents computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, we may not be successful in doing so. as a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices. we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. we rely on third-party suppliers. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade restrictions; tariffs; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; or other factors beyond our control. any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our business. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks. as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products, including greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements and increased potential product liability and product recall exposure. to effectively 10 table of contents execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. in addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as expanded enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, cybersecurity and data privacy, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, supply chain transparency, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. in addition, recent healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance, and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. in addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market 11 table of contents speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions,

performance or financial condition. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. in addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the data breach, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters.

methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. we have implemented programs like boss, bopis and direct fulfillment, and are rolling out bodfs, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers' needs and expectations. customers are also using social media to provide

investigations and civil litigation on our results of operations, which could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial results and reputation. the data breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems. since the data breach occurred, we have recorded $161 million of pretax expenses, net of expected insurance recoveries, in connection with the data breach, as described in more detail in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation" and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data". we are facing putative class actions filed in the u.s. and canada and a consolidated shareholder derivative action brought by two purported shareholders in the u.s., and other claims have been and may be asserted on behalf of customers, payment card issuing banks, shareholders, or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising out of the data breach. we are also facing investigations by a number of state and federal agencies. these claims and investigations may adversely affect how we operate our business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, and result in additional costs and fines. in addition, the governmental agencies investigating the data breach may seek to impose injunctive relief, which could 8 table of contents materially increase our data security costs, adversely impact how we operate our systems and collect and use customer information, and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers. if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage, and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement actions. our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers' personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our associates, our suppliers and our company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. we also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. however, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in additional significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. in addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business. we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, paypal, our private label credit cards and installment loan program, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems, as reflected in our recent data breach. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. in addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. as a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services or delay purchasing or payment for those products and services. other factors beyond our control including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters and 9 table of contents other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data in managing our business. for these systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, we may not be successful in doing so. as a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. we use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. for example, to improve our special order process we are currently rolling out com, our new customer order management system, which our customers will be able to access online, and we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive user-friendly interface for our customers. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade restrictions; tariffs; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; or other factors beyond our control. any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives, such as project sync and com, are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to 10 table of contents provide high-quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term and lead to product availability issues. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks. as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. in addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, which includes the integration of interline to expand our business with professional customers and in the mro market, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. in fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition of interline, which we believe will enhance our ability to serve our professional customers and increase our share of the mro market. our goal is to serve all of our different pro customer groups through one integrated approach to drive growth and capture market share in the retail, services and mro markets, and this strategy depends, in part, on the successful integration of interline. as with any acquisition, we need to successfully integrate the target company's products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated synergies or benefits of the interline acquisition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation. furthermore, even if interline is successfully integrated, the acquisition may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with the interline business. if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. 11 table of contents our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as expanded enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; cybersecurity and data privacy; the sale of some of our products; transportation; logistics; supply chain transparency; taxes; energy costs or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. in addition, recent healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance, and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. in addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. in addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the data breach, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts. additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the company. 12 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report. 28 table of contentsrisk factors 7 risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. we operate in markets that are highly competitive. we compete principally based on customer experience, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability, assortment and presentation of merchandise. in each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, mro companies and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services. in addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers now routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. we use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our 7 table of contents margins or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. as we continue to see increasing strength in the housing and home improvement market, resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels. in addition, each of our primary customer groups diy, difm and pro have different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. we have implemented programs like boss, bopis, bodfs and direct fulfillment, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers' needs and expectations. customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates. failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to provide quick and low-cost delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. an inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly as the economy continues to improve and the labor market tightens. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. in managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of ransomware; 8 table of contents catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. as a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. we use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments. we also continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive user-friendly interface for our customers, as evidenced by our recent redesign of our homedepot.com website. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage, and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement actions. our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers' personal information, preferences and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information. we also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. we have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. however, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. in addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs. we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business. we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, paypal, our private label credit cards, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. if we 9 table of contents fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. in addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. as a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. other factors beyond our control including unemployment and foreclosure rates; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to

instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and information technology systems. these initiatives, such as project sync and com, our new customer order management system, are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term and lead to product availability issues. failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; or other factors beyond our control. any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. 10 table of contents if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand

include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. in addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. if we are unable to manage effectively our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. however, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. in addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. we may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. in fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition of interline, which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our professional customers and increased our share of the mro market. during fiscal 2016, we continued to develop and implement our strategy with interline. our goal is to serve all of our different pro customer groups through one integrated approach to drive growth and capture market share in the retail, services and mro markets, and this strategy depends, in part, on our continuing integration of interline. as with any acquisition, we need to successfully integrate interline's products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. furthermore, even if interline is successfully integrated, the acquisition may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with the interline business and the wholesale market. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. in recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. these laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; 11 table of contents energy costs; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be impacted. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; potential tariffs and other import-related taxes; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. in addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. we have incurred losses related to the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (the "data breach"); we may incur additional losses or experience future operational impacts on our business, which could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial results and reputation. the data breach involved the theft of certain payment card information and customer email addresses through unauthorized access to our systems. since the data breach occurred, we have recorded $198 million of pretax expenses, net of expected insurance recoveries, in connection with the data breach, as described in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data". we are still facing a consolidated shareholder derivative action brought by two purported shareholders and an investigation by a number of state attorneys general. these matters may adversely affect how we operate our business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, and result in additional costs and fines. we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. in addition to the matters discussed above with respect to the data breach, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts. additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the company. 12 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report. 28 table of contentsrisk factors . 7 risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. our industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. as a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to 7 table of contents multichannel, to exclusively online. in each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, mro companies, home d cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. we compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, assortment, and delivery options. with respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. our customers routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online, read product reviews, and compare prices, products, and delivery options, regardless of whether they shop in-store or online. further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in one home depot supply chain, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. we use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. in addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. as noted above, customers routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. we have our boss, bopis, bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times, options and costs. customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates. failure to maintain our stores, utilize our store space effectively, and offer a safe shopping environment; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively 8 table of contents implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. an inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. conversely, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. in managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales, customer data, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of ransomware; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. as a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. we use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing inspiration, as well as product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments. we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers, as evidenced by our recent re-platform of our homedepot.com website. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. the implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we recently announced our intent to substantially increase our investments to create the one home depot experience, including significant investments over the next five years to build a one home depot supply chain. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers, simplify customer interaction, provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience, and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. the cost 9 table of contents and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact profitability. further, accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel. we may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts. failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. in addition, our store and interconnected retail initiatives, enhanced supply chain, and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; or other factors beyond our control. any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers' personal information, preferences, and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information. we also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. we have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. however, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. as we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (the "data breach"), any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. in addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs. we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business. we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, paypal, our private label credit cards, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards 10 table of contents and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. in addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. as a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. other factors beyond our control including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism; and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales and results of operations. product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company. if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations 11 table of contents regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement actions, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors. if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. in addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing. all of our vendors and service providers must comply with our ser standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, sources of supply, and child and forced labor. we have an ser audit process, but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards. our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks. as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. in addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if we are unable to manage effectively our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. however, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. in addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. in fiscal 2015, we acquired interline, which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our pros. in fiscal 2017, we acquired compact power and the company store to expand our product and service offerings. with these and any other acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate each target company's products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings. 12 table of contents our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. in recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. these laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. in fiscal 2017, congress enacted the tax act, which significantly changes how the u.s. taxes corporations. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations. the ultimate impact of the tax act on us may differ from our current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the u.s. federal income tax code. as we complete our analysis of the tax act, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. further, uncertainties also exist in terms of how u.s. states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these u.s. federal income tax changes, which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be negatively impacted. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. in addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. we may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. we are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. the occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 13 table of contents changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. we are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts. additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the company. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. interest rate risk. we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. at january 28, 2018 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating rate debt principal was $1.75 billion, or approximately 7% of our debt portfolio. a 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk. we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into u.s. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $ 8.5 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2017 . our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. commodity price risk. we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 28 table of contentsrisk factors . 8 risk factors. our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. our industry is highly competitive and evolving. as a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. the internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face. in each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, mro companies, home d cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. we compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, product assortment, and delivery options. with respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. our customers routinely use a variety of electronic devices and platforms to shop online, read product reviews, and compare prices, products, and delivery options, regardless of where or how they shop. further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in one home depot supply chain, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. we use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could adversely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. in addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. 8 table of contents customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. as noted above, customers routinely use technology and a variety of electronic devices and platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. we have our boss, bopis, bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times, options and costs. customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called "shrink"). failure to improve and maintain our stores, utilize our store space effectively, and offer a safe shopping environment; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs and maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. the implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we are substantially increasing our investments to create the one home depot experience, including significant investments over the next several years to build the one home depot supply chain. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience; and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. the one home depot initiative will require significant investment in our operations and systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems and support. if we are unable to effectively manage the volume and nature of these changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. the cost and potential problems, defects of design and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, implementing new technology, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact profitability. further, accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel. we may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts. in addition, our store and interconnected retail initiatives, one home depot supply chain, and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. in addition, to support our strategic initiatives, including one home depot supply chain, and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. an inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability 9 table of contents to retain and attract associates. further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. in managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, this operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing and denial of service attacks, and ransomware; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. as a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and platforms. we use our digital platforms both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing inspiration, as well as product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to drive sales, regardless of whether they occur in-store or online. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. the retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to an interconnected experience. we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; or other factors beyond our control. any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage, management and transmission of customers' personal information, preferences, and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information. we also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data 10 table of contents protection and cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and will continue to attempt to gain access to, these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. we have implemented and regularly review and update our systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. however, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. as we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. in addition, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business, and the implementation of these requirements has become more complex. maintaining our compliance with those requirements may require significant effort and cost, and failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, or lawsuits. we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business. we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, paypal, our plccs, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. in addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. as a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. other factors beyond our control including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism; and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. 11 table of contents our business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, alone or together with natural disasters, could impact our operations. natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. they can also, temporarily or on a long-term basis, disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. in addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs. as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation, and negatively impact our sales and results of operations. product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company. if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including health-related concerns, could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement actions, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors. if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. in addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing. all of our vendors and service providers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, sources of supply, and child and forced labor. we have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards. 12 table of contents our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, supplier relations, and reputational risks. as we expand our proprietary product offerings, in addition to other product-related risks discussed herein, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. in addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. however, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. in addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. for each of our acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate the target company's products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. in recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. these laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale and pricing of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. in fiscal 2017, congress enacted the tax act, which significantly changes how the u.s. taxes corporations. during fiscal 2018, additional guidance related to the tax act was issued by the u.s. department of the treasury and the irs. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. 13 table of contents department of the treasury, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations. further, uncertainties also exist in terms of how u.s. states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these u.s. federal income tax changes, which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. for example, there are growing concerns regarding trade relations between the u.s. and china, as both countries have indicated their intentions to impose significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories, as well as concerns related to the renegotiation of certain other trade agreements, including the north american free trade agreement. as a significant portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the u.s., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our u.s. locations. other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in u.s. trade policy and regulations. in addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. we may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. we are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. the occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. gaap and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs. we are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary 14 table of contents course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results. additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the company. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. interest rate risk. we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. at february 3, 2019 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating rate debt principal was $2.1 billion , or approximately 8% of our long-term debt portfolio. a 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. the united kingdom's financial conduct authority has announced the intent to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021. if libor is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our floating rate notes, interest rate swap agreements, and credit instruments, which utilize libor as a benchmark in determining the interest rate, to replace libor with the new standard that is established. as a result, we may incur incremental costs in transitioning to a new standard, and interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard. there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate. as such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. foreign currency exchange rate risk. we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into u.s. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $ 8.8 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2018 . our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. commodity price risk. we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 28 table of contentsrisk factors . 8 risk factors. our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. our industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. as a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. the internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face. in each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, mro companies, home d cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. we compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, product assortment, and delivery options. with respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, as well as low-price or free shipping. our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in one supply chain, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. we use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. intense 8 table of contents competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could adversely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines) or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. as our customers begin to expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations. our ability to collect and use that data, however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security. in addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. customers routinely use technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product reviews, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. we have our boss, bopis, bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times, options and costs. customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called shrink ). higher rates of shrink, which we have recently experienced, can require operational changes that may increase costs and impact the customer experience. failure to improve and maintain our stores, utilize our store space effectively, and offer a safe shopping environment; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. the implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have been substantially increasing our investments to create the one home depot experience, including significant investments over several years to build one supply chain. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience; and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. the one home depot initiative will require significant investment in our operations and systems, as well as the development and execution 9 table of contents of new processes, systems and support. the one supply chain initiative also involves significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network. if we are unable to effectively manage the volume, nature and cost of these investments, projects and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. the cost and potential problems, defects of design and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, implementing new technology, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, identifying appropriate facility locations, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact profitability. further, accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel. we may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts. in addition, our store and interconnected retail initiatives, one supply chain, and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to complete the initiatives or realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. in addition, to support our strategic initiatives, including one supply chain, and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. an inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract associates. further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. some of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service providers, including certain cloud platform providers. in managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, this operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, associate data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, and order fulfillment. for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches or data theft; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, spyware, denial of service attacks, and ransomware; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. as a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security, and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. in addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers. these investments involve replacing existing systems with successor systems; outsourcing certain technology to third-party service providers; making changes to existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud; or designing or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. these efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or 10 table of contents corruption of data, changes in security processes, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, security failures, reputational harm, and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms. we use our digital platforms both as sales channels for our products and services and also as methods of providing inspiration, as well as product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to drive sales, regardless of whether they occur in-store or online. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. the retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to an interconnected experience. we continually seek to enhance all of our online and digital properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers. disruptions, delays, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers' expectations, could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; international trade disputes or trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shortages of truck drivers; shipping capacity constraints; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; public health issues, including pandemics or quarantines (such as the recent covid-19 coronavirus outbreak); or other factors beyond our control. any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage, management and transmission of customers' personal information, preferences, and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information. we also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and will continue to attempt to gain access to, these systems and data through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. we have implemented and regularly review and update our systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. however, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. as we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. in addition, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business. the implementation of these requirements has 11 table of contents also become more complex. maintaining our compliance with those requirements, including the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), may require significant effort and cost, require changes to our business practices, and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a personalized customer experience. in addition, failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits or reputational damage. we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business. we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, paypal, our plccs, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult, costly, or uncertain. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in our payments and payment processing systems. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. in addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. as a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. other factors beyond our control including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines; and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. for example, the recent pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus covid-19 has led to work and travel restrictions within, to, and out of a number of countries and supply chain disruptions and delays. these restrictions and delays, which may expand depending on the progression of the pandemic, have impacted and may continue to impact suppliers and manufacturers of certain of our products. this may make it difficult for our suppliers to source and manufacture products in, and to export our products from, affected areas. as a result, we have faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition. at this time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of covid-19 on our business and the costs that we may incur as a result. infections have become more widespread, which may worsen the supply shortage or restrict third-party manufacturing or other operations. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we have canceled or shifted to virtual experiences for certain supplier and associate events and have shifted certain store support operations to remote or virtual, and we may deem it appropriate or advisable to take further similar actions in the future. we have shortened our customer-facing hours in all of our stores and temporarily closed our stores in puerto rico, and we may need to restrict access to or close certain of, or face labor shortages in, other stores or facilities, which could negatively impact productivity, sales, or operating expenses. we are taking steps in our stores to manage foot traffic to better protect our customers and associates. we have also expanded our paid time off policy to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates 12 table of contents may be facing as a result of covid-19, and we may face additional health insurance and labor-related costs. the pandemic may also reduce foot traffic in our stores or temporarily reduce demand for our products or services. in certain jurisdictions, we have had to cease sales of or delay commencement of certain services deemed non-life-sustaining, and other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements. further, customers' financial condition may be adversely impacted as a result of the impacts of covid-19 and efforts taken to prevent its spread, which could result in reduced demand for our products and services. in addition, our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. if the impacts of the pandemic create disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets, or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt. any of these occurrences may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. our business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, alone or together with natural disasters, as well as other catastrophic events, could impact our operations. natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. they can also, temporarily or on a long-term basis, disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. in addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs. as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism or violence, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control. if we are unable to access products to meet our customers' demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner, our sales and gross margin results may be adversely impacted. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. 13 table of contents failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation, and negatively impact our sales and results of operations. product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company. if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including health-related concerns, could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement actions, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors. if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. in addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing. all of our vendors and service providers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, sources of supply, and child and forced labor. we have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards. our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, supplier relations, and reputational risks. as we expand our proprietary product offerings, in addition to other product-related risks discussed herein, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. in addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. however, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. in addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. for each of our acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate the target company's products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings. 14 table of contents our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. in recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. these laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data privacy and cybersecurity; the sale and pricing of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. in fiscal 2017, congress enacted the tax act, which significantly changed how the u.s. taxes corporations. during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, additional guidance related to the tax act was issued by the u.s. department of the treasury and the irs. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. department of the treasury, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations. further, in addition to uncertainties that continue to exist in terms of how u.s. states will react to the tax act, recently enacted changes in foreign countries within which we operate could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted. our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political, social and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; limitations on access to ports; risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. for example, trade tensions between the u.s. and china have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. as a significant portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the u.s., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our u.s. locations. other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in u.s. trade policy and regulations. in addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. we may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. we are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. the 15 table of contents occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. gaap and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs. we are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results. additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the company. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. interest rate risk. we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. at february 2, 2020 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating rate debt principal was $2.9 billion , or approximately 10% of our long-term debt portfolio. a 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. the united kingdom's financial conduct authority has announced the intent to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021. when libor is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our floating rate notes, interest rate swap agreements, and credit instruments which utilize libor as a benchmark in determining the interest rate, to replace libor with the new standard that is established. as a result, we may incur incremental costs in transitioning to a new standard, and interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard. decisions have not been finalized regarding the future utilization of libor or any particular replacement rate. as such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. foreign currency exchange rate risk. we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into u.s. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $8.9 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2019 . our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. commodity price risk. we experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. this price volatility could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or our results of operations. in order to mitigate price volatility, we monitor commodity price fluctuations and may adjust our selling prices accordingly; however, our ability to recover higher costs through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we currently do not use derivative instruments to manage these risks. 28 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments at various times to manage the risk associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. these contracts are insignificant to the company's operations and financial position. we believe that our exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments (such as investments and borrowings), interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk is not material.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results. our objective for holding derivative instruments is to decrease the volatility of earnings and cash flow associated with fluctuations in these rates. we have financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. these instruments include fixed rate debt and other contractual arrangements. we issued $500 million of 5 3/8% senior notes in fiscal 2001 maturing on april 1, 2006 and $500 million of 6 1/2% senior notes in fiscal 1999 maturing on september 15, 2004. as of february 3, 2002, the market values of the publicly traded 5 3/8% and 61/2% senior notes were approximately $511 million and $531 million, respectively. we have two interest rate swap agreements, both designed to hedge the market risk associated with interest rate volatility. we have one agreement in the notional amount of $300 million that swaps fixed rate interest on $300 million of our $500 million 5 3/8% senior notes for a variable interest rate equal to libor plus 30 basis points and expires on april 1, 2006. we have another agreement expiring january 31, 2003 in the notional amount of $690 million that swaps a variable interest rate for a fixed rate of 6 3/4%, designed to mitigate the interest rate risk related to the portfolio of our proprietary credit card, which is serviced by a third party.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled "management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in the company's 2002 annual report, and is also attached in exhibit 13 hereto. 16risk factors 5 risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the possible adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not perceive them to be material. such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. the state of the housing, construction and home improvement markets, rising costs, a reduction in the availability of financing, weather and other conditions in north america could further adversely affect our costs of doing business, demand for our products and services and our financial performance. in 2008, the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets have deteriorated dramatically and more severely than was previously anticipated. we expect the deterioration to continue through 2009 and our fiscal 2009 net sales and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to decline from fiscal 2008. other factors including increasing unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, consumer confidence, weather, natural disasters and other factors beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services and our financial performance. these and other similar factors could increase our costs and cause our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. we rely on third party suppliers. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. 5 table of contents our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a long-term bank line-of-credit commitment. although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2008, there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted if the current recessionary trends persist or worsen. continued volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers with a better experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. failure to design attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, sales and profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations. changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business. in addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business. also, passage of the employee free choice act or other similar laws in congress could lead to higher labor costs by encouraging unionization efforts among our associates and disruption of store operations. our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates. to be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs. in addition, many of our associates are in hourly positions with historically high turnover rates. we compete with other retail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. we also depend on our executives and other key associates for our success. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. 6 table of contents changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. increased competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. we operate in markets that are highly competitive. we compete principally based on price, store location, customer service and assortment of merchandise. in each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers. in addition, we compete with specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design professionals, local and regional distributors, and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and resources from other matters. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, and a significant privacy breach could adversely affect our business. the protection of our customer, employee and company data is important to us. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business. in addition, our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. a significant breach of customer, employee or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines and lawsuits. any inability to open new stores on schedule will delay the contribution of these new stores to our financial performance. we expect to increase our presence in certain existing markets and enter new markets. our ability to open new stores will depend primarily on our ability to identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, attract and train qualified employees, and manage pre-opening expenses, including construction costs. environmental regulations, local zoning issues and other laws related to land use affect our ability to open new stores. failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open stores on schedule, which will delay the impact of these new stores on our financial performance. 7 table of contents if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our international operations. our strategy includes expansion of our operations in international markets by selective acquisitions, strategic alliances and the opening of new stores. our ability to successfully execute our strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our u.s. operations. in addition, international expansion may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with fcpa and local anti-bribery law compliance. additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 24 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the

approximately 23,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. as of the end of fiscal 2005, we had 1,984 the home depot stores located throughout the u.s.

home decorating and remodeling projects called expo design center and two retail store formats focused on professional customers called home depot supply and the home depot landscape supply. as of the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 34 expo design center stores, three home depot supply stores and 11 the home depot landscape supply stores. we also have two the home depot floor stores located in texas and florida that primarily sell flooring products. in addition to our retail stores, our business also includes home depot supply. home depot supply distributes products and sells installation services primarily to professional business contractors, businesses and municipalities and generally operates in the following three areas: maintenance, repair and operations ("mro") supplies maintenance, repair and operating products primarily to multi-family housing, hospitality and lodging facilities. included under mro are national waterworks, inc. and apex supply company, inc. national waterworks 1 provides a wide range of water and wastewater transmission products through 137 branches in 36 states. apex supply is a wholesale supplier of plumbing, hvac, appliances and

as textual references. the information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this form 10-k. retail businesses the home depot stores operating strategy. our operating strategy is to offer a broad assortment of high-quality merchandise and services at competitive prices using knowledgeable, service-oriented personnel and strong marketing and credit promotions. we believe that our associates' knowledge of products and home improvement techniques and applications is very important to our marketing approach and our ability to maintain and enhance customer satisfaction. customers. the home depot stores serve three primary customer groups: do-it-yourself ("d-i-y") customers: these customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. to complement the expertise of our associates, the home depot stores offer "how-to" clinics taught by associates and merchandise vendors. do-it-for-me ("d-i-f-m") customers: these customers are typically home owners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project and/or installation. we arrange for the installation of a variety of the home depot products through qualified independent contractors. professional customers: these customers are professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen and tradesmen. in many stores, we offer a variety of programs to these customers, including additional delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, extensive merchandise selections and expanded credit programs, all of which we believe increase sales to this group. 2 products. a typical the home depot store stocks 35,000 to 45,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. the following table shows the percentage of revenues of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years: percentage of revenues for fiscal year ended product group january 29, 2006 january 30, 2005 february 1, 2004 building materials, lumber and millwork 24.2 % 24.4 % 23.2 % plumbing, electrical and kitchen 29.4 29.0 28.9 hardware and seasonal 27.1 26.9 27.6 paint, flooring and wall covering 19.3 19.7 20.3 total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % we buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world and are not dependent on any single supplier. most of our merchandise is purchased directly from manufacturers, which eliminates "middleman" costs. we believe that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all of the products we sell in the home depot stores. to complement and enhance our product selection, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. during fiscal 2005, we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments including, but not limited to, behr premium plus&reg; paint, charmglow&reg; gas grills, hampton bay&reg; lighting, mills pride&reg; cabinets, vigoro&reg; lawn care products, husky&reg; hand tools, ridgid&reg; and ryobi&reg; power tools, pegasus&reg; faucets, traffic master&reg; carpet, glacier bay&reg; bath fixtures and veranda&reg; decking products. we may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to the home depot. in 2005, innovative and distinctive products continued to be a growth driver supporting our merchandising strategy. the following successes helped differentiate the home depot in the marketplace: an enhanced grill lineup led by our proprietary charmglow&reg; brand and the exclusive ducane stainless steel grills; flooring innovation through our dupont realtouch elite laminate flooring; introduction of lg appliances and a broadened assortment of maytag and ge products; expanded patio lineup led by our proprietary hampton bay&reg; set; broadened assortment of paint, including colores origenes, bellagio faux paint, and the ralph lauren metallic and suede paint; innovative products from ryobi&reg;, including the ryobi one+ system , ryobi multitaskit and ryobi gas pressure washer; and growing power tool lineup, including the introduction of exclusive makita and milwaukee lithium-ion power tools for professional and d-i-y customers. we maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source high-quality products directly from manufacturers. this gives our customers a broader selection of innovative products and better value, while enhancing our gross margin. our product development merchants travel internationally to identify opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores. additionally, we have two sourcing offices located in shanghai and shenzhen, china, and have a quality assurance engineer located in milan, 3 italy. we also have product development merchants, as well as a sourcing office, in monterrey, mexico. these initiatives enable us to improve product features and quality, to import products not currently available to our customers and to offer products at a lower price than would otherwise be available if purchased from third-party importers. we currently source products from more than 600 factories in approximately 35 countries. services. the home depot and expo design center stores offer a variety of installation services. these services target d-i-f-m customers who select and purchase products and installation of those products from us. these installation programs include products such as carpeting, flooring, cabinets, countertops and water heaters. in addition, we provide professional installation of a number of products sold through our in-home sales programs, such as generators and furnace and central air systems. our wholly-owned subsidiaries, thd at-home services, inc. and home depot installation services, inc., sell and install our roofing, siding and window programs. with the exception of home depot installation services, inc., which employs its own qualified installers, the home depot's installation services are provided by qualified independent contractors throughout the u.s. and canada. we also arrange for the provision of flooring, countertop, cabinet and window covering installation services to production home builders through our creative touch interiors brand. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we extended our services business by acquiring chem-dry, the world's largest carpet and upholstery cleaning franchisor. chem-dry has nearly 4,000 franchises worldwide, including 2,500 in the u.s. store growth united states . at the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 1,793 the home depot stores in the u.s., including the territories of puerto rico and the virgin islands. during fiscal 2005, we opened 140 new the home depot stores, including four relocations, in the u.s. although these new store openings occurred primarily in existing markets, we continued our geographic expansion by opening stores in a number of new markets. to increase customer service levels, gain incremental sales and enhance long-term market penetration, we often open new stores near the edge of market areas served by existing stores. while these openings may initially have a negative impact on comparable store sales growth, we believe this "cannibalization" strategy increases customer satisfaction and our overall market share by reducing delays in shopping, increasing utilization by existing customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations. during fiscal 2005, we believe that approximately 20% of our stores were cannibalized by certain of our new stores. canada . at the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 137 the home depot stores in ten canadian provinces. of these stores, 21 were opened during fiscal 2005, including one relocation. mexico . at the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 54 stores in mexico. of these stores, 10 were opened during fiscal 2005. china. at the end of fiscal 2004, we entered into an arrangement to lease commercial office space in shanghai to support a retail initiative in china. we are currently pursuing our strategy for entry into the china home improvement marketplace. expo design center stores expo design center stores are designed to be a complete home decorating and remodeling resource for middle- to upper- income d-i-f-m customers by offering

your other warehouse, which is also a part of home depot direct, is a distributor of special order faucet and plumbing fixtures, lighting, fan and hardware products for the home depot and expo design center stores and a variety of other third-party resellers. your other warehouse carries over 60,000 products from over 130 suppliers, including kohler&reg;, american standard&reg; and other major manufacturers. your other warehouse operates five distribution facilities and a call center and employs approximately 900 associates. store support services information technologies. during fiscal 2005, we continued to improve our technology capabilities by opening a second technology center, located in austin, texas. in addition to providing redundancy, the center allows for growth and expansion. the center currently houses engineers, software developers and computer operation staff. in fiscal 2005, we completed the rollout of back-end scanned receiving to all u.s. and canadian stores, which allows us to simplify, standardize and automate how we receive product. we commenced vendor certification for certified receiving. we continued installation of self-checkout registers, which, as of the end of fiscal 2005, were in 1,272 stores and we grew centralized automatic replenishment to 20% of store sales. we also implemented a special order services initiative pilot in 285 stores and we introduced new mobile cart functionality in all stores. while our technology investments have been primarily focused in our stores, we invested in technology improvements in other areas. during fiscal 2005, we implemented new financial systems for our mexico retail operations, upgraded our call centers, improved our websites and launched several new direct-to-consumer brands. associate development. at the end of fiscal 2005, we employed approximately 345,000 associates, of whom approximately 26,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. approximately 68% of our associates are employed on a full-time basis. we believe that our employee relations are very good. to attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. we develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of our customers and associates. these programs, including mandatory product knowledge training classes, are designed to increase associates' knowledge of merchandising departments and products, and to educate, develop and test the skills of our associates. because we primarily promote or relocate current associates to serve as managers and assistant managers for new stores, training and assessment of our associates is essential to our growth. our district managers and store managers typically meet with our human resources managers to discuss the development of assistant managers and department heads. we have implemented programs in our stores and divisional offices to ensure that we hire and promote the most qualified associates in a non-discriminatory way. one of the most significant programs we have is our annual human resources review process, which assesses and reviews leaders and teams, succession planning and executive pipeline, high potential associates, staffing, retention, diversity, training and compliance. the program is closely linked to our performance management process, which evaluates the performance, leadership and potential of all associates. we also maintain a list of qualified associates who are interested in new assignments and of qualified outside applicants that can be reviewed when positions become available. marketing. we are one of the nation's largest retail advertisers, and utilize a broad range of mass media and targeted media. we also incorporate major sponsorships into our marketing plan, such as nascar&reg;, the u.s. olympic&reg; team, the home depot center, espn college game day&reg;, and a number of home and garden shows. we also utilize marketing arrangements with television shows of 7 strategic importance, such as trading spaces&reg;, while you were out&reg; and this old house&reg;. we extend our reach and educate our customers through proprietary publications, such as the 1-2-3 &reg; home improvement book series. we execute our marketing campaigns on both a national and local basis. because our stores are located throughout the u.s., canada and mexico, we can achieve greater efficiencies than smaller retailers by using national advertising. at the same time, we tailor our advertising locally to respond to market differences, both in terms of products and the competitive environment. we produce advertisements in english, spanish and french-canadian. credit services. we offer credit purchase programs through third-party credit providers to professional, d-i-y and d-i-f-m customers. in fiscal 2005, approximately 4 million new the home depot credit accounts were opened, bringing the total number of the home depot account holders to approximately 16 million. proprietary credit card sales accounted for approximately 26% of store sales in fiscal 2005. we also offer an unsecured home improvement loan that gives our customers the opportunity to finance the purchase of products and services in our stores. we believe that this loan program not only supports large sales, such as kitchen and bath remodels, but also generates incremental sales from our customers. intellectual property. through our wholly-owned subsidiary, homer tlc, inc., we have registered or applied for registration, in a number of countries, for a variety of internet domain names, service marks and trademarks for use in our businesses, including the home depot&reg;; home depot direct; hampton bay&reg; fans, lighting and accessories; glacier bay&reg; toilets, sinks and faucets; pegasus&reg; faucets and bath accessories; commercial electric&reg; lighting fixtures; workforce&reg; tools, tool boxes and shelving; www.10crescentlane.com and www.pacestrading.com. furthermore, through various acquisitions and filings, we have also obtained and now maintain patent portfolios relating to certain products and services provided by the home depot, and continually seek to patent or otherwise protect selected innovations we incorporate into our products and business operations. we regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brand, e-commerce, stores and new areas of business. we are not aware of any facts that could be expected to have a material adverse affect on our intellectual property. quality assurance program. we have a quality assurance program for our directly imported globally-sourced products. through this program, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance, which measures factors such as product quality and timeliness of shipments. the performance record is made available to the factories to allow them to strive for improvement. the quality assurance program addresses the following three main components: factory: the factory development group ensures all direct import factories are assessed and qualified to manufacture quality products that meet the expectations we have established, as well as to assess their compliance with our policies; products: the product engineering group authorizes laboratories to test products prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors conduct inspections at the factory to ensure consistent compliance with our requirements, applicable national and international standards, and features determined by our merchants; and packages: the package-engineering group authorizes laboratories to test packaging prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors inspect packaging at the factory to ensure consistent compliance with all relevant requirements. logistics. we use several mechanisms to lower distribution costs and increase our efficiencies. import distribution centers process our globally-sourced merchandise. at the end of fiscal 2005, we had 16 import distribution centers located in the u.s. and canada. at the end of fiscal 2005, we also had 30 lumber distribution centers in the u.s. and canada to support the lumber demands of our stores and 8 10 transit facilities. at our transit facilities, we receive merchandise from manufacturers and immediately provide transfer onto trucks for delivery to our stores. we believe that the transit facility network will provide service to approximately 80% of our stores in the continental u.s. by the end of fiscal 2006. we also operate other specialty distribution centers for specific merchandise needs. the distribution centers and transit facilities allow us to provide high service levels to our stores at relatively low costs. at the end of fiscal 2005, approximately 40% of the merchandise shipped to our stores was processed through our network of distribution centers and transit facilities. as our networks evolve, we expect to increase the percentage of merchandise processed by our facilities. the remaining merchandise will be shipped directly from our suppliers to our stores. in addition to replenishing merchandise supplies at our stores, we also provide delivery services directly to our customers. we continually assess opportunities to improve our distribution network to better satisfy the needs of our stores and our customers and to lower costs. environmental, health &amp; safety ("eh&amp;s"). we are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers and associates, and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. our eh&amp;s function in the field is directed by trained associates focused primarily on execution of the eh&amp;s programs. additionally, we have an atlanta-based team of dedicated eh&amp;s professionals who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a company-wide basis. our eh&amp;s professionals are responsible for managing our global eh&amp;s program, which is implemented in partnership with store level associates, store and division management, and the human resources and merchandising departments. the primary elements of our eh&amp;s program are (1) establishment of eh&amp;s standards and processes for all aspects of store operations and merchandising, (2) effective training of appropriate associates on all applicable standards and (3) verifying compliance with established eh&amp;s standards. seasonality. our business is seasonal to a certain extent. generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. competition. our business is highly competitive, based in part on price, store location, customer service and depth of merchandise. in each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers. in addition to these entities, our expo design center stores compete with specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design professionals. moreover, our home depot supply businesses compete with local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. due to the variety of competition we face, we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors. we estimate that our share of the u.s. home improvement and professional supply market is approximately 11% and we believe that we are an effective and significant competitor in our markets. item 1a. risk factors. the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future. those statements may relate to such matters as net sales growth, increases in comparable store sales, impact of cannibalization, commodity price inflation and deflation, implementation of store initiatives, protection of intellectual property rights, net earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, store openings and closures, payments on commercial paper borrowings, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, operations after the 9 closing of the merger with hughes supply, the timing and certainty of closing of the merger with hughes supply, the accounting and financial impact of the merger with hughes supply, strategic direction and the demand for our products and services. all forward-looking statements by us are qualified by the risks described below. these risks are not the only risks we face. our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently consider immaterial to our business. rising costs, a reduction in the availability of consumer credit, weather and other conditions in north america could adversely affect our costs of doing business, demand for our products and services and our average ticket price. interest rates, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, consumer credit availability, weather, natural disasters, terrorism and other conditions that adversely affect consumer demand for our products and services could adversely affect our financial performance. these and other similar factors could: increase our costs, cause our customers to delay undertaking or determine not to undertake new home improvement projects, cause our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, and lead to a decline in average ticket price. we rely on third party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate us from our competitors. as part of our strategy of differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute our strategy of differentiation. any inability to open new stores on schedule will delay the contribution of these new stores to our financial performance. we expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. our ability to open new stores will depend primarily on our ability to: identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, attract and train qualified employees, and manage pre-opening expenses, including construction costs. 10 our ability to open new stores also will be affected by environmental regulations, local zoning issues and other laws related to land use. failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open stores on schedule, which will delay the impact of these new stores on our financial performance. the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and our technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our stores and in our administrative functions. our technology initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers a better in-store experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail altogether. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, sales and profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. if we cannot successfully identify and complete acquisition opportunities and integrate the acquired businesses, we may be unable to successfully execute our expansion strategy. the success of our expansion strategy depends, in part, on our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, complete acquisitions on financially attractive terms and integrate them with our other businesses. integration of our acquisitions presents significant challenges and risks to our business, including: distraction of management from regular business concerns, assimilation and retention of employees and customers of the acquired business, integration of technologies, services and products, and achievement of appropriate internal control over financial reporting. there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with acquiring and integrating other businesses. 11 if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our international operations. our expansion strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions, strategic alliances and the opening of new stores. our ability to successfully execute our expansion strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our u.s. operations. in addition, our international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. risks inherent in our international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates. to be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates while controlling related labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs. in addition, many of our associates are in hourly positions with historically high turnover rates. we compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. we also depend on our executives and other key associates for our success. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, inventories, self-insurance and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. increased competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. our business is highly competitive, based principally on price, store location, customer service and depth of merchandise. in each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers. in addition, we compete with specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design professionals, local and regional distributors, and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. moreover, our home depot supply businesses compete with local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these pressures, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. 12 we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs . we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. we cannot predict the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities, with certainty. the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations. changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business. in addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products could increase our costs of doing business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures

operations outside the united states is also reported in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. retail segment operating strategy. our operating strategy is to offer a broad assortment of high-quality merchandise and services at competitive prices using knowledgeable, service-oriented personnel and strong marketing and credit promotions. we believe that our associates' knowledge of products and home improvement techniques and applications is very important to our marketing approach and our ability to maintain and enhance customer satisfaction. customers. the home depot stores serve three primary customer groups: do-it-yourself ("d-i-y") customers: these customers are typically home owners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. to complement the expertise of our associates, the home depot stores offer "how-to" clinics taught by associates and merchandise vendors. do-it-for-me ("d-i-f-m") customers: these customers are typically home owners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project and/or installation. we arrange for the installation of a variety of the home depot products through qualified independent contractors. professional customers: these customers are professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen and tradesmen. in many stores, we offer a variety of programs to these customers, including additional delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, extensive merchandise selections and expanded credit programs, all of which we believe increase sales to these customers. 2 products. a typical the home depot store stocks 35,000 to 45,000 products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary items. the following table shows the percentage of net sales of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years: percentage of net sales for fiscal year ended product group january 28, 2007 january 29, 2006 january 30, 2005 building materials, lumber and millwork 23.6 % 24.2 % 24.4 % plumbing, electrical and kitchen 30.8 29.4 29.0 hardware and seasonal 27.0 27.1 26.9 paint, flooring and wall

behr premium plus&reg; paint, charmglow&reg; gas grills, hampton bay&reg; lighting, mills pride&reg; cabinets, vigoro&reg; lawn care products, husky&reg; hand tools, ridgid&reg; and ryobi&reg; power tools, pegasus&reg; faucets, traffic master&reg; carpet, glacier bay&reg; bath fixtures and veranda&reg; decking products. we may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names that are exclusive to the home depot. in fiscal 2006, innovative and distinctive products continued to be a growth driver supporting our merchandising strategy. the following successes helped differentiate the home depot in the marketplace: introduced the most comprehensive lineup of top brand lawn tractors and mowers available nationwide, including cub cadet&reg;, toro&reg;, john deere&reg; and honda&reg;; launched an expanded outdoor living assortment, including hampton bay patio and charmglow grills; launched an exclusive line-up of lithium-ion power tools from milwaukee&reg;, ridgid and makita&reg;; and launched the lg&reg; steamwasher and the maytag&reg; epic washer

we also have a quality assurance engineer located in milan, italy and we have product development merchants, as well as a sourcing office, in monterrey, mexico. we currently source products from more than 800 factories in approximately 35 countries. services. the home depot and expo design center stores offer a variety of installation services. these services target d-i-f-m customers who select and purchase products and installation of those products from us. these installation programs include products such as carpeting, flooring, cabinets, countertops and water heaters. in addition, we provide professional installation of a number of products sold through our in-home sales programs, such as generators and furnace and central air systems. 3 store growth united states . at the end of fiscal 2006, we were operating 1,872 the home depot stores in the u.s., including the territories of puerto rico and the virgin islands. during fiscal 2006, we opened 86 new the home depot stores,

million. proprietary credit card sales accounted for approximately 28% of store sales in fiscal 2006. we also offer an unsecured home improvement loan program through third-party credit providers that gives our customers the opportunity to finance the purchase of products and services in our stores. we believe this loan program not only supports large sales, such as kitchen and bath remodels, but also generates incremental sales from our customers. logistics. our logistics programs are designed to ensure excellent product availability for customers, effective use of our investment in inventory and low total supply chain costs. at the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 18 import distribution centers located in the u.s. and canada. at the end of fiscal 2006, we also operated 30 lumber distribution centers in the u.s. and canada to support the lumber demands of our stores and 10 transit facilities to receive merchandise from manufacturers for immediate delivery to our stores. at the end of fiscal 2006, approximately 40% of the merchandise shipped to our stores flowed through our network of distribution centers and transit facilities. as our networks evolve, we expect to increase our flow-through. the remaining merchandise will be shipped directly from our suppliers to our stores. in addition to replenishing merchandise supplies at our stores, we also provide delivery services directly to our customers. seasonality. our business is seasonal to a certain extent. generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. competition. our business is highly competitive, based in part on price, store location, customer service and depth of merchandise. in each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers. in addition to these entities, our expo design center stores compete with specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design professionals. due to the variety of competition we face, we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors. hd supply segment operating strategy. our operating strategy is to provide a total solution for every phase of a building project, from infrastructure to construction to lifetime maintenance and repair and remodel. we believe that our broad product and service offering, our highly knowledgeable sales force and our reputation for superior customer service enable us to be a single-source supplier to our customers for the entire project lifecycle. 4 customers. we distribute products and offer services primarily to builders, contractors, government entities, industrial businesses and maintenance professionals. our customers typically select their vendors primarily on the basis of product availability, relationships with and expertise of sales personnel, price and the quality and scope of services offered. additionally, professional customers generally purchase large volumes, are repeat buyers because of their involvement in longer-term projects and require specialized services. we complement our product offering with customer-driven, value-added services, such as integrated supply, design assistance, kitting, assembly and fabrication services. products and services. our products and services are focused around the following four major categories that are related to different phases of a building project: infrastructure: this category covers the products and services to construct and support the public works systems for residential and commercial projects. construction: this category covers the interior and exterior structural building components for residential and commercial projects. maintenance: this category covers products and services for the routine maintenance, repair and operations needs of multifamily housing, hospitality, healthcare, government and industrial facilities. repair and remodel: this category covers home improvement products and building materials, serving the consumer, professional handyman and light remodeler markets. inventories. we maintain extensive inventories to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers. our inventories are based on the needs, delivery schedules and lead times of our customers. we focus on distributing products that leverage our strengths in inventory management, purchasing, specialized sales force, distribution and logistics, credit management and information technology. credit services. over 90% of our sales volume is facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers. our businesses offer credit to customers, either through unsecured credit that is based solely upon the creditworthiness of the customer, or secured credit for materials sold for a specific job where the security lies in lien rights associated with the material going into the job. the type of credit offered depends both on the financial strength of the customer and the nature of the business in which the customer is involved. end users, resellers and other non-contractor customers generally purchase more on unsecured credit than secured credit. these lines of credit are granted only after a sufficient review of the creditworthiness of the customer. in addition, on a regular basis, large unsecured credit lines are reviewed to ensure they are still financially sound. logistics. our distribution network consists of over 1,000 combined branches and central distribution centers in the united states. the efficient operation of our distribution network is critical in providing quality service to our customer base. our central distribution centers and branches use warehouse management technology to optimize receiving, inventory control and picking, packing and shipping functions. in addition, we leverage several of our larger branches as distribution points for certain product lines. the majority of customer orders are shipped from inventory at our branches. in order to maintain complete control of the delivery process, we use over 4,000 vehicles from our total vehicle fleet to deliver products to our customers. we also accommodate special orders from our customers and facilitate the shipment of certain large volume orders directly from the manufacturer to the customer. orders for larger construction projects normally require long-term delivery schedules throughout the period of construction, which in some cases may continue for several years. 5 seasonality. our business is seasonal to a certain extent. generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter. competition. we are one of the largest wholesale distributors of our range of products in the united states, and we believe that no other company competes against us across all of our product lines. however, there is significant competition in each of our individual product lines. our competition includes other wholesalers, manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer base and some of our customers that resell our products. to a limited extent, retailers of plumbing, electrical fixtures and supplies, building materials, maintenance repair and operations supplies and contractors' tools also compete with us. competition varies depending on product line, customer classification and geographic area. the principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise as to application and usage; advisory or other service capabilities; ability to build and maintain customer relationships; same-day delivery capabilities in certain product lines; pricing of products and provision of credit. support services information technologies. during fiscal 2006, we continued to make significant information technology investments to support better customer service and provide an improved shopping environment in our stores. we completed the deployment of self-checkout registers to all our u.s. stores and the majority of our stores in canada and enhanced our coupon processing at all check-outs. we also began implementing in-store call boxes and installed voice over internet phone systems in order to provide customers faster assistance from our associates. to support the continued growth of our appliance business, we upgraded our proprietary depot direct appliance fulfillment system. in addition to significant investments in store technology, we upgraded our order management system, which improves the speed and accuracy of online order processing and provides customers the ability to check special order status on the internet. we also defined a set of common enterprise system platforms for our hd supply wholesale businesses and began migrating the hd supply businesses to these platforms, beginning with the payroll and financial functions. we also began work on the strategic effort to implement a new retail systems platform to further improve the performance of our merchandising functions and store operations. we also commenced the effort to add new automation into our supply chain functions focusing on new systems for warehouse distribution, transportation management and enhancements to support greater order penetration through our centralized replenishment systems. associates. at the end of fiscal 2006, we employed approximately 364,000 associates, of whom approximately 26,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. approximately 68% of our associates are employed on a full-time basis. we believe that our employee relations are very good. to attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve. intellectual property. through our wholly-owned subsidiary, homer tlc, inc., we have registered or applied for registration, in a number of countries, for a variety of internet domain names, service marks and trademarks for use in our businesses, including the home depot&reg;; hd supply; hampton bay&reg; fans, lighting and accessories; glacier bay&reg; toilets, sinks and faucets; pegasus&reg; faucets and bath accessories; commercial electric&reg; lighting fixtures; workforce&reg; tools, tool boxes and shelving; www.hdsupply.com and www.doitherself.com. furthermore, we have also obtained and now maintain patent portfolios relating to certain products and services provided by the home depot, and continually seek to patent or otherwise protect selected innovations we incorporate into our products and business operations. we regard our intellectual property as having significant value to each business segment and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brand, e-commerce, stores 6 and new areas of business. we are not aware of any facts that could be expected to have a material adverse affect on our intellectual property. quality assurance program. we have a quality assurance program for our directly imported globally-sourced products. through this program, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance, which measures factors such as product quality and timeliness of shipments. the performance record is made available to the factories to allow them to strive for improvement. the program addresses quality assurance at the factory, product and packaging levels. environmental, health &amp; safety ("eh&amp;s"). we are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers and associates, and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. our eh&amp;s function in the field is directed by trained associates focused primarily on execution of the eh&amp;s programs. additionally, we have an atlanta-based team of dedicated eh&amp;s professionals who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a company-wide basis. item 1a. risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. while we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. these statements are not guarantees of future performance. they are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as net sales growth, comparable store sales, impact of cannibalization, state of the residential construction and housing markets, commodity price inflation and deflation, implementation of store initiatives, protection of intellectual property rights, net earnings performance, including depreciation and amortization expense, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, store openings and closures, capital allocation and expenditures, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, return on invested capital, management of our purchasing or customer credit policies, strategic direction, including whether or not a sale or initial public offering of hd supply will occur or, if a transaction is undertaken, its terms or timing, and the demand for our products and services. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 of this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not perceive them to be material, that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. you are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the sec. rising costs, a reduction in the availability of financing, weather and other conditions in north america could adversely affect our costs of doing business, demand for our products and services and our average ticket price. interest rates, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, availability of financing, employment, state of the residential construction and housing markets, consumer confidence and general economic outlook, weather, natural disasters, terrorism and other conditions that adversely 7 affect consumer demand for our products and services could adversely affect our financial performance. these and other similar factors could: increase our costs, cause our customers to delay undertaking or determine not to undertake new home improvement projects, cause our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, cause our customers to delay or determine not to undertake new spending in the commercial, residential, industrial and public infrastructure markets, and lead to a decline in customer transactions and in average ticket price. we rely on third party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products and supplies from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. our ability to access products and supplies also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate us from our competitors. as part of our strategy of differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute our strategy of differentiation. any inability to open new stores on schedule will delay the contribution of these new stores to our financial performance. we expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. our ability to open new stores will depend primarily on our ability to: identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, attract and train qualified employees, and manage pre-opening expenses, including construction costs. our ability to open new stores also will be affected by environmental regulations, local zoning issues and other laws related to land use. failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open stores on schedule, which will delay the impact of these new stores on our financial performance. 8 the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and our technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and will continue to make, significant technology investments both in our stores and branches and in our administrative functions. our technology initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers a better experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail altogether. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. failure to design attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, sales and profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our international operations. our strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions, strategic alliances and the opening of new stores and branches. our ability to successfully execute our strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our u.s. operations. in addition, our international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. risks inherent in our international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates. to be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates while controlling related labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs. in addition, many of our associates are in hourly positions with historically high turnover rates. we compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and 9 motivating them. we also depend on our executives and other key associates for our success. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, inventories, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. increased competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. we operate in markets in industries that are highly competitive. our retail business competes principally based on price, store location, customer service and depth of merchandise. our hd supply business competes principally based on ability to provide and deliver supplies, product knowledge and expertise, advisory services and availability of credit. in each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers. in addition, we compete with specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design professionals, local and regional distributors, and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these pressures, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. we cannot predict the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities, with certainty. the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations. changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business. changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products could increase our costs of doing business. in addition, changes to federal, state and local tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business. 10 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and

condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not perceive them to be material. such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. 6 the state of the housing, construction and home improvement markets, rising costs, a reduction in the availability of financing, weather and other conditions in north america could adversely affect our costs of doing business, demand for our products and services and our financial performance. in recent months, the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets have deteriorated dramatically. we expect the deterioration to continue through 2008, and our fiscal 2008 net sales and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to decline. other factors including interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, consumer confidence, weather, natural disasters and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services and our financial performance. these and other similar factors could: increase our costs, cause our customers to delay undertaking or determine not to undertake new home improvement projects, cause our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, and lead to a decline in customer transactions and our financial performance. we rely on third party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships

financial performance. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers with a better experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to

information required by this item is incorporated by reference to item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report. 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.risk factors 6 risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets. adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. other factors including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. we operate in markets that are highly competitive. we compete principally based on customer services, price, store location and assortment of merchandise. in each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences, expectations and needs. failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, expectations as to service levels, spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. 6 table of contents our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates to meet the needs and expectations of our customers while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations, such as the proposed employee free choice act, and health and other insurance costs. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. in addition, our centralization of certain human resources functions might not be readily adapted by our associates and therefore might not provide the anticipated benefits. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. we rely on third party suppliers. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of recent economic conditions), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and cost and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. if we do not maintain the security of customer, associate or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. any significant compromise or breach of customer, associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. 7 table of contents a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations. changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business. in addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business. passage of the employee free choice act or other similar laws in congress could lead to higher labor costs by encouraging unionization efforts among our associates and disruption of store operations. healthcare reform, if enacted, could also adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2009, there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to current economic conditions. new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and continued volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. our ability to successfully operate in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), other legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with fcpa and local anti-bribery law compliance. additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. 8 table of contents if we are unable to manage effectively our installation service business, we could be subject to fines and lawsuits. we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our d-i-f-m customers through third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures that provide protections beyond those required by law to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction. if we fail to manage these processes effectively, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive verdicts. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and resources from other matters. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report. 28 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors. the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. the risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. sustained uncertainty regarding current economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or sustained uncertainty about these markets or the economy could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. other factors including high levels of unemployment and foreclosures, interest rate fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, the availability of financing, the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, weather, natural disasters and other conditions beyond our control could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance. strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. we operate in markets that are highly competitive. we compete principally based on customer service, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability and assortment of merchandise. in each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers, as well as with installers of home improvement products. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through maintenance of superior customer service and customer loyalty, our financial performance and our market share could be adversely affected. we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and 6 table of contents consumer preferences, expectations and needs. failure to maintain attractive stores and to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, expectations as to service levels, spending patterns and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs. our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits, and health and other insurance costs. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future. the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. we rely on third party suppliers. if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our current suppliers experience financial difficulties, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the world), suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or cost, and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation. if we do not maintain the security of customer, associate or company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. any significant compromise or breach of customer, associate or company data security could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. 7 table of contents a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. we also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. the implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. we have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. in addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether. disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, including damage or destruction to our distribution centers, could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to our reputation. such a disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. we are subject to various federal, state or local laws and regulations that govern different aspects of our business. recently, there have been a large number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, other wage or workplace regulations, the sale of some of our products, transportation, logistics, taxes, energy costs or environmental matters, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our store operations. healthcare reform under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 enacted in march 2010 could adversely impact our labor costs and our ability to negotiate favorable terms under our benefit plans for our associates. our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by the volatility in the capital markets. we obtain and manage liquidity from the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to capital markets, including our commercial paper programs supported by a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks. although we currently maintain a strong investment grade rating and had no outstanding commercial paper obligations as of the end of fiscal 2010, there is no assurance that our ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets, if needed, will not be adversely impacted due to economic conditions. new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit, higher cost of borrowing and lack of confidence in the equity market, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. 8 table of contents if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations. our ability to successfully operate in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by our inability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), other legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and risks associated with fcpa and local anti-bribery law compliance. additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. if we are unable to manage effectively our

installers. if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax
