on page 33 and 34 of ibm's 2004 annual report to stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors: economic environment and corporate it spending budgets: if overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. ibm's diverse portfolio of products and offerings is designed to gain market share in strong and weak economic climates. the company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. ibm continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: ibm continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. in 2005, the company realigned its operations and organizational structure in europe to give sales and delivery teams greater authority, accountability and flexibility to make decisions and to execute more effectively on behalf of our clients. additionally, in 2005, many of the company's corporate functions such as legal, finance, human resources, information technology, and real estate site operations which had been previously replicated for many of the individual countries where ibm operates were integrated so that they could be managed and their resources optimized on a global scale. in addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this integration improves ibm's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on learning, development and knowledge sharing. innovation initiatives: ibm invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies, and other institutions. to deliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, ibm has been moving away from commoditized categories of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. examples include ibm's leadership position in the design and fabrication of asics; the design of smaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; the design of "grid" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power; the transformation and integration of business processes; and the company's efforts to advance open technology standards and to engage with governments, academia, think tanks and nongovernmental organizations on emerging trends in technology, society and culture. in the highly competitive it industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single-technology competitors, ibm's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. ibm is managing this risk by more closely linking its r&amp;d organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs, as discussed in description of business ibm worldwide organizations. 8 open standards: the broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task. the broad-based acceptance of open standards rather than closed, proprietary architectures also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. ibm is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the on demand operating environment, and because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and it industry. there are a number of competitors in the it industry with significant resources and investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. this competition will result in increased pricing pressure and/or ip claims and proceedings. ibm's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as linux, and the development of rational software development tools, which can be used to develop and upgrade any other company's software products. investing in growth opportunities: the company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gain. areas of investment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client and industry-specific solutions, business performance transformation services, key technologies and emerging growth countries such as china, russia, india and brazil. protection of intellectual property: while the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, ibm believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. ibm owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. licenses under patents owned by ibm have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. these protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. seasonality of revenues: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. as a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. these factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. local legal, economic and health conditions: the company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), avian influenza (bird flu) or any other pandemic, or local or global health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations, its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers, and customer demand. insurance: the company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss. while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. 9 environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. tax matters: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. internal controls: effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. if the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's brand and operating results could be harmed. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. in addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. use of estimates: in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the company uses certain estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion on pages 40 to 42 of ibm's 2005 annual report to stockholders. in addition, as discussed in note o, "contingencies and commitments" on pages 76 to 79 of ibm's 2005 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under sfas no. 5 "accounting for contingencies", including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion, and therefore actual results may differ. competitive conditions: the company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. the company's businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from 10 fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. the company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. unlike many of its competitors, the company has a broad portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. as a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. volatility of stock price: the company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in financial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. as a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock price is subject to significant volatility. dependence on and compensation of key personnel: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that ibm will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. in addition, companies in the information technology and services industry whose employees accept positions with ibm may claim that ibm has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons by ibm would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. any such claims could limit or prevent ibm from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial costs in defending the company or its employees against these claims, whether or not they have merit. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. currency and customer financing risks: the company derives a significant percentage of its non-u.s. revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful. customer credit risk on trade receivables: the company's diversified client base includes a large number of worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations, companies and governments. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis 11 and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. the company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible trade receivables and regularly reviews such reserves by considering factors such as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. customer credit risk is mitigated due to the large number of clients constituting the company's worldwide client base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. distribution channels: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. acquisitions and alliances: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company issues debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of our debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including changes in interest rates, the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations, and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under item 1a entitled "risk factors". there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under item 1a entitled "risk factors", including the section entitled "volatility of stock price", as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about our financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities, and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks: refer to the section titled

individuals and boards of directors, as well as extensive experience in corporate derivative litigation, federal and state enforcement actions and commercial litigation. 9 item 1a. risk factors: economic environment and corporate it spending budgets: if overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. ibm's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent results in both strong and weak economic environments. the company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. ibm continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: ibm continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. in addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this integration has improved ibm's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on learning, development and knowledge sharing. as ibm continues to drive higher levels of automation and integration into its business, ibm's dependency on internal it systems also increases. innovation initiatives: ibm invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. to deliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, ibm has been moving away from commoditized categories of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. in the highly competitive it industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single technology competitors, ibm's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. ibm is managing this risk by more closely linking its r&amp;d organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs. open standards: the broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task. the broad-based acceptance of open standards rather than closed, proprietary architectures also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. ibm is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the on demand operating environment, and because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and it industry. there are a number of competitors in the it industry with significant resources and investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. this competition will result in increased pricing pressure and/or ip claims and proceedings. investing in growth opportunities: the company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. ibm continues to invest in emerging growth countries such as china, russia, india and brazil. the developing nature of these countries presents political, social and economic risks to ibm's business, including the potential for inadequate infrastructure and labor disruptions. protection of intellectual property: while the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, ibm believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on 10 any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. ibm owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. licenses under patents owned by ibm have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. these protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. seasonality of revenues and purchases: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. as a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. these factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. local legal, economic and health conditions: the company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derived more than half of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), avian influenza (bird flu) or any other pandemic, or local or global health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations, its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers and customer demand. insurance: the company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss. while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. 11 internal controls: effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. if the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's operating results could be affected. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. in addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. use of estimates: in connection with the application of gaap and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the company uses certain estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion on pages 45 to 47 of ibm's 2006 annual report to stockholders. in addition, as discussed in note o, "contingencies and commitments" on pages 89 to 92 of ibm's 2006 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of sfas no. 5 "accounting for contingencies", including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion, and therefore, actual results may differ. competitive conditions: the company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. the company's businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. the company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. unlike many of its competitors, the company has a broad set of capabilities and businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. as a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. volatility of stock price: the company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in financial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. as a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock price is subject to significant volatility. dependence on and compensation of key personnel: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that ibm will be 12 able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. in addition, companies in the information technology and services industry whose employees accept positions with ibm may claim that ibm has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons by ibm would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. any such claims could limit or prevent ibm from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial costs in defending the company or its employees against these claims, whether or not they have merit. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. currency and customer financing risks: the company derives a significant percentage of its non-u.s. revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk, the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt, liabilities and the determination of residual values, and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful. customer credit risk on trade receivables: the company's diversified client base includes a large number of worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations, companies and governments. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. the company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible trade receivables and regularly reviews such reserves by considering factors such as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. customer credit risk is mitigated due to the large number of clients constituting the company's worldwide client base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. distribution channels: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. acquisitions and alliances: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. 13 risk factors related to ibm securities: the company issues debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of our debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including changes in interest rates, the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under item 1a. entitled "risk factors". there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under item 1a. entitled "risk factors", including the section entitled "volatility of stock price", as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about our financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks: refer to the section titled "market risk" on pages 47 and 48 of ibm's 2006 annual report to stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference. 15 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks"risk factors" on pages 10

officers of the registrant (at february 22, 2008): age officer since chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer: samuel j. palmisano(1) 56 1997 executive vice president: nicholas m.

william m. zeitler, group executive, systems and technology group 60 2000 vice president: timothy s. shaughnessy, controller 50 2004 (1) member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above, with the exception of robert c. weber, has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. mr. weber was a partner at jones day, an international law firm, until joining ibm in 2006. he was with jones day for almost 30 years, and his career included counseling corporations, individuals and boards of directors, as well as extensive experience in corporate derivative litigation, federal and state enforcement actions and commercial litigation. 9 item 1a. risk factors: economic environment and corporate it spending budgets: if overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. ibm's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent results in both strong and weak economic environments. the company addresses this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. ibm continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: ibm continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. in addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this integration has improved ibm's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on learning, development and knowledge sharing. as ibm continues to drive higher levels of automation and integration into its business, ibm's dependency on internal it systems also increases. innovation initiatives: ibm invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. to deliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, ibm has been moving away from commoditized categories of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. in the highly competitive it industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single technology competitors, ibm's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. ibm is managing this risk by more closely linking its r&amp;d organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation depends in part on its ability to continue to stand for industry-leading technology and solutions that provide business advantages. open standards: the broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task. the broad-based acceptance of open standards rather than closed, proprietary architectures also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. ibm is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the on demand operating environment, and because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and it industry. there are a number of competitors in the it industry with significant resources and investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. this competition may result in increased pricing pressure and/or ip claims and proceedings. investing in growth opportunities: the company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher-value segments of enterprise computing providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. ibm continues to invest in dozens of emerging growth countries including brazil, russia, india and china. the developing nature of emerging growth countries presents political, social and economic risks to ibm's business, including 10 risks from inadequate infrastructure and labor disruptions in these countries, which could impact the company's ability to deliver to its clients around the world. protection of intellectual property: while the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, ibm believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. ibm owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. licenses under patents owned by ibm have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. these protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. data protection: the company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and processes, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. breaches of the company's security measures could expose the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. seasonality of revenues and purchases: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. as a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. these factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. local legal, economic and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and local currency. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), avian influenza (bird flu) or any other pandemic, or local or global health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers and customer demand. insurance: the company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss. while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and 11 regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. internal controls: effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. if the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's operating results could be affected. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. in addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. use of estimates: in connection with the application of generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the company uses certain estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion on pages 47 to 49 of ibm's 2007 annual report to stockholders. in addition, as discussed in note n, "contingencies and commitments" on pages 94 through 96 of ibm's 2007 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of sfas no. 5, "accounting for contingencies", including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion, and therefore, actual results may differ. competitive conditions: the company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. the company's businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from some of the world's largest global enterprises to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. the company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. unlike 12 many of its competitors, the company has a broad set of capabilities and businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. as a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. volatility of stock price: the company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in financial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. as a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock price is subject to significant volatility. dependence on key personnel and reliance on critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. in addition, companies in the information technology and services industry whose employees accept positions with ibm may claim that ibm has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons by ibm would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. any such claims could limit or prevent ibm from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial costs in defending the company or its employees against these claims, whether or not they have merit. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. currency and customer financing risks: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values, and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. customer credit risk on receivables: the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients in the company's financial services, public, and small and medium business sectors. the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' 13 financial conditions. the company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible receivables and regularly reviews such reserves by considering factors such as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. distribution channels: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. acquisitions and alliances: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issues debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including, the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors". there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under item 1a. entitled "risk factors", including the section entitled "volatility of stock price", as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. 14 risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks: refer to the section titled "market risk" on pages 49 and 50 of ibm's 2007 annual report to stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks"risk factors" on pages 10 through 13 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference. the following information is included in ibm's 2008 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference: segment

chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer: samuel j. palmisano(1) 57 1997 senior vice presidents: rodney c. adkins, development and manufacturing, systems and technology group 50 2007 michael e. daniels, global technology services 54 2005 jon c. iwata, marketing and communications 46 2002 john e. kelly, iii, research and intellectual property 55 2000 r. franklin kern, global

robert c. weber, legal and regulatory affairs, and general counsel 58 2006 vice president: james j. kavanaugh, controller 42 2008 (1) member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above, with the exception of robert c. weber, has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. mr. weber was a partner at jones day, an international law firm, until joining ibm in 2006. he was with jones day for almost 30 years, and his career included counseling corporations, individuals and boards of directors, as well as extensive experience in corporate derivative litigation, federal and state enforcement actions and commercial litigation. 9 item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and corporate it spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for systems, software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources in both emerging and more established geographical markets. these efforts may not yield their intended gains in overall efficiency and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from commoditized categories of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in the highly competitive it industry, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries, including brazil, russia, india and china, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. breaches of data protection could impact the company's business: the company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and processes, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. breaches in security could expose the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. 10 the company's revenues for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles, the structure of products and services contracts and the seasonality of technology purchases. as a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. these factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business in that country and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and local currency. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. ibm's 2008 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. 11 ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2008 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note o, "contingencies and commitments" in ibm's 2008 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of sfas no. 5, "accounting for contingencies," including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. because by definition these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, actual financial results may differ. competitive conditions: the company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures (see discussion about competition in item 1. business above). the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. changes in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide 12 variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2008 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves for uncollectible receivables, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions and alliances include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. 13 risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled "market risk" on pages 51 and 52 of ibm's 2008 annual report to stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk"risk factors" on pages 11 to 14 are cautionary statements that accompany those

(at february 23, 2010): age officer since samuel j. palmisano, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer(1) 58 1997 rodney c. adkins, senior vice president, systems and technology group 51 2007 colleen f. arnold, senior vice president, application management services 52 2010 michael e. daniels, senior vice president, global technology services 55 2005 jon c. iwata, senior vice president, marketing and communications 47 2002 james j. kavanaugh, vice president and controller 43 2008 john e. kelly iii, senior vice president, research and intellectual property 56 2000 r. franklin kern iii, senior vice president, global business services 56 2008 robert j. leblanc, senior vice president, software middleware group 51 2010 mark loughridge, senior vice president, chief financial officer 56 1998 j. randall macdonald, senior vice president, human resources 61 2000 steven a. mills, senior vice president, software group 58 2000 michael d. rhodin, senior vice president, software solutions group 49 2010 virginia m. rometty, senior vice president, global sales and distribution 52 2005 linda s. sanford, senior vice president, enterprise transformation 57 2000 timothy s. shaughnessy, senior vice president, services delivery 52 2004 robert c. weber, senior vice president, legal and regulatory affairs, and general counsel 59 2006 (1) member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above, with the exception of robert c. weber, has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. mr. weber was a partner at jones day, an international law firm, until joining ibm in 2006. he was with jones day for almost 30 years, and his career included counseling corporations, individuals and boards of directors, as well as extensive experience in corporate derivative litigation, federal and state enforcement actions and commercial litigation. 10 item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and corporate it spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for systems, software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources in both emerging and more established geographical markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from commoditized categories of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in the highly competitive it industry, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries, including brazil, russia, india and china, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. breaches of data security could impact the company's business: the company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and processes, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. breaches in security could expose the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. 11 the company's revenues for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles, the structure of products and services contracts and the seasonality of technology purchases. as a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. these factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business in that country and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and local currency. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the u.s. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, 12 which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2009 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2009 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note o, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2009 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. because by definition these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. changes in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. 13 the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2009 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves for uncollectible receivables, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to fund and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. risks to the company from acquisitions and alliances include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk

conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. 10 item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and corporate it spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for systems, software and services decreases, whether

intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. breaches of data security could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. breaches in security could expose the company, its customers or others to risks of loss, including the misuse of information or systems, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. 11 the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted

business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of operations and 12 financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the u.s. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note o, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. changes in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in 13 addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. risks to the company from acquisitions and alliances include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. 14 entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled "market risk" on pages 53 and 54 of ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk"risk factors" on pages 11 to 16 are cautionary

of the registrant (at february 28, 2012): age officer since chairman of the board samuel j. palmisano* 60 1997 president and chief executive officer virginia m. rometty* 54 2005 rodney c. adkins, senior vice president, systems and technology group 53 2007 colleen f. arnold, senior vice president, application management services 54 2010 james p. bramante, senior vice president, growth markets

2006 * member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and corporate it spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for systems, software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from certain segments of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself 11 through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive environment, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. breaches of security could expose the company, its customers or others to risks of loss, including the misuse of information or systems, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. also, the company could be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. 12 due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the u.s. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2011 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. 13 ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2011 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2011 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. changes in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates 14 operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2011 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. risks to the company from acquisitions and alliances include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 15 the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors

company. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and corporate it spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for systems, software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from certain segments of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive environment, the company could fail in its ongoing 12 efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing, cloud computing, and new and emerging markets and countries to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand for our other products or services. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. breaches of security could expose the company, its customers or others to risks of loss, including the misuse of information or systems, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. also, the company could be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or 13 inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the u.s. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2012 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, 14 or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2012 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2012 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. changes in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. 15 the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2012 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. risks to the company from acquisitions and alliances include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not 16 make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled "market risk" on page 62 of ibm's 2012 annual report to stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for systems, software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in 14 quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from certain segments of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations or expand and scale them with sufficient speed, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in strategic growth opportunities, including new and emerging markets and countries, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand for our other products or services. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. the company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by proposed changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing the ownership and protection of patents and other intellectual property. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal information of employees, customers and others. in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems, and those of customers, third-parties contractors and vendors, and some of those attempts may be successful. such breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems, theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, system disruptions, and denial of service. in the event of such breaches, the company, its customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding 15 to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. as these threats develop and grow, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. as a global enterprise, the company could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection. additionally, cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. moreover, the company's strategic growth areas involve new products, new customers, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous 16 examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the u.s. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2013 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2013 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2013 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. 17 the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2013 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. in addition, the failure of third party distributors and resellers to comply with all 18 applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions, alliances and dispositions include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. from time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. the company is subject to legal proceedings risks: as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, ibm is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. the risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2013 annual report to stockholders. the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. 19 risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled "market risk" on pages 70 and 71 of

50 2014 stanley j. sutula iii, vice president and controller 49 2015 bridget a. van kralingen, senior vice president, ibm global business services 51 2012 * member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the by-laws. each 13 executive officer named above, with the exception of kenneth m. keverian, has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. mr. keverian was a senior partner at the boston consulting group, a global management consulting firm, until joining ibm in 2014. he was with boston consulting group for 26 years and he focused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for ibm's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from certain segments of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in its strategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. the company's ability to protect its intellectual property 14 could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal information of employees, customers and others. in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems, and those of customers, third-parties contractors and vendors. successful breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems, theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, system disruptions, and denial of service. in the event of such breaches, the company, its customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. the company experiences and responds to cybersecurity threats, although none has had a material adverse effect on the company to date. as these threats develop and grow, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. as a global enterprise, the company could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection. additionally, cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. moreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, 15 pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the united states. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2014 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. 16 the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2014 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2014 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and after globalfoundries completes the acquisition of ibm's global commercial semiconductor business, it will become ibm's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain semiconductors. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of 17 non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2014 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. in addition, the failure of third party distributors and resellers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions, alliances and dispositions include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. from time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. the company is subject to legal proceedings risks: as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, ibm is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. the risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2014 annual report to stockholders. the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different 18 currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk

joining ibm in 2014. he was with boston consulting group for 26 years and he focused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. 12 item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for ibm's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from certain segments of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in its strategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client

governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. the company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. in 13 the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems. the risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. successful breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; and system disruptions or denial of service. in the event of such breaches, the company, its customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. the company experiences and responds to cybersecurity threats, although none has had a material adverse effect on the company to date. as the cybersecurity landscape evolves, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. as a global enterprise, the company and its business practices related to data, including personal data, could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection, and the potential impact to the company of any such laws or regulations, as well as potential security breaches, could become greater. additionally, cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. moreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. 14 the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the united states. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2015 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2015 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in 15 addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2015 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and with the completion of globalfoundries' acquisition of ibm's global commercial semiconductor business, it became ibm's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain semiconductors. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. product quality issues could impact the company's business and operating results: the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. if errors, malfunctions or defects are experienced by customers, there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the 16 use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2015 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. in addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions, alliances and dispositions include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. from time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. the company is subject to legal proceedings risks: as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, ibm is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. the risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2015 annual report to stockholders. the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. 17 risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled "market risk" on page 68 of ibm's 2015 annual report to stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk"risk factors" on pages 12 to 18 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference. the following information is included in ibm's 2016 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference: segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or services pages 150 to 154. financial information by geographic areas

the registrant (at february 28, 2017): age officer since virginia m. rometty, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer* 59 2005 michelle h. browdy, senior vice president, legal and regulatory affairs, and general counsel 52 2015 erich clementi, senior vice president, ibm global markets 58 2010 robert f. del bene, vice president and controller 57 2017 diane j. gherson, senior vice president, human resources 59 2013 james j. kavanaugh, senior vice president, transformation and operations 50 2008 john e. kelly iii, senior vice president, ibm cognitive solutions and ibm research 63 2000 kenneth m. keverian, senior vice president, corporate strategy 60 2014 martin j. schroeter, senior vice president and chief financial officer 52 2014 * member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors annually as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above, with the exception of kenneth m. keverian, has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. mr. keverian was a senior partner at the boston consulting group, a global management consulting firm, until joining ibm in 2014. he was with boston consulting group for 26 years and he focused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for ibm's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes, functions and technologies to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from certain segments of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition, ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in its strategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share 12 gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. the company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. as a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly challenging and may have impacts on the company's business, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. as the company's business focus on data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. the general data protection regulation that will come into force in the european union in may 2018 will cause the company to incur additional compliance costs. computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. the risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware or other attacks; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denial of service. in the event of such actions, the company, its customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. the company experiences and responds to cybersecurity threats, although none has had a material adverse effect on the company to date. as the company's business and the cybersecurity 13 landscape evolve, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers will also depend on factors such as actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. moreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of 14 operations and financial condition in future periods. the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. as countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the united states. premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. ibm's 2016 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2016 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2016 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of or insufficient knowledge and skills. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the 15 company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and with the completion of globalfoundries' acquisition of ibm's global commercial semiconductor business in 2015, it became ibm's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain semiconductors. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. product quality issues could impact the company's business and operating results: the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. if errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers, there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2016 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if 16 future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. in addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions, alliances and dispositions include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. from time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. the company is subject to legal proceedings risks: as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, ibm is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. the risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2016 annual report to stockholders. the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of 17 ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled "market risk" on pages 74 and 75 of ibm's 2016 annual report to stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference. 19 quantitative and qualitative disclosures

2005 michelle h. browdy, senior vice president, legal and regulatory affairs, and general counsel 53 2015 erich clementi, senior vice president, ibm global integrated accounts 59 2010 robert f. del bene, vice president and controller 58 2017 diane j. gherson, senior vice president and chief human resources officer 60 2013 james j. kavanaugh, senior vice president and chief financial officer 51 2008 john e. kelly iii, senior vice president, ibm cognitive solutions and ibm research 64 2000 kenneth m. keverian, senior vice president, corporate strategy 61 2014 martin j. schroeter, senior vice president, ibm global markets 53 2014 * member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors annually as provided in the by-laws. each executive officer named above, with the exception of kenneth m. keverian, has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. mr. keverian was a senior partner at the boston consulting group, a global management consulting firm, until joining ibm in 2014. he was with boston consulting group for 26 years and he focused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for ibm's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes, functions and technologies to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from certain segments of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. damage to ibm's reputation could impact the company's business: ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader. ibm's reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. if the 11 company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in its strategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced employees, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. the company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, and other third parties to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. the risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. the company's products, services and systems may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. in the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. the company also experiences and responds to cybersecurity threats. to date, there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future. as the company's business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. in the company's industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered and 12 publicized across a broad range of hardware and software products, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. in addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company and its customers. cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers will also depend on factors such as actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. although the company takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. as a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and may have impacts on the company's business, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. as the company's business focus on data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. the general data protection regulation that will come into force in the european union in may 2018 will continue to cause the company to incur additional compliance costs. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. moreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with u.s. and foreign data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. 13 the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. as countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the united states. premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. ibm's 2017 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported 14 financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2017 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2017 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled employees and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of or insufficient knowledge and skills. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. further, many of ibm's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and with the completion of globalfoundries' acquisition of ibm's global commercial semiconductor business in 2015, it became ibm's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain semiconductors. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. product quality issues could impact the company's business and operating results: the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. if errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company's operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. the company is exposed to currency and financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on 15 the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2017 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. in addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions, alliances and dispositions include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. from time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. the company is subject to legal proceedings risks: as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, ibm is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. the risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2017 annual report to stockholders. the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal 16 proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk

financing, marketing, and communications 54 2014 * member of the board of directors. all executive officers are elected by the board of directors annually as provided in the company's by-laws. each executive officer named above, with the exception of kenneth m. keverian, has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years. 11 mr. keverian was a senior partner at the boston consulting group, a global management consulting firm, until joining ibm in 2014. he was with boston consulting group for 26 years and he focused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for ibm's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, agile processes and changes to the way the company works, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence, blockchain, iot, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. damage to ibm's reputation could impact the company's business: ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader. ibm's reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers and talent could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. if the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, and emerging business models, ibm's costs may increase or the client demand for our products or services may decline. ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the 12 company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. the company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. certain of the company's offerings incorporate open source software licensed without warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections. if the code is no longer maintained by the relevant open source community, then it may be more difficult to make the necessary revisions to the software, including modifications to address security vulnerabilities, which could impact ibm's ability to market its products, mitigate cybersecurity risks or fulfill its contractual obligations to customers. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company's business: in the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, and other third parties to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. the risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. the company's products, services and systems, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. these products, services and systems are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, and government sectors. successful cybersecurity attacks, breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. in the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. to date, while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate security incidents, including those associated with cybersecurity attacks, there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity attack that has a material adverse effect in the future. as the company's business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. in the company's industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. in addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company and its customers, and may not be detected or remediated for some time afterward, particularly if additional steps are required to implement remediation-related updates. cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in 13 disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. as a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and may have impacts on the company's business, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. as the company's business focus on data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. the european union's general data protection regulation (gdpr) and an increased number of data protection laws around the globe could continue to result in increased compliance costs and risks as a result of (i) increased regulatory enforcement of gdpr and other data protection rules and (ii) the trend of shifting and sharing data processing responsibilities from companies having direct relationship with consumers to all companies in the data processing chain. any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market. the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. in addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with u.s. and foreign data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. for example, the u.k. referendum to exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as "brexit", has caused global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. the company is actively monitoring and planning for brexit. 14 the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. as countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the united states. premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. ibm's 2018 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap) 15 requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2018 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2018 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company depends on skilled employees and could be impacted by a shortage of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. further, many of ibm's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. product quality issues could impact the company's business and operating results: the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. if errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company's operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations, financial results and reputation. the company is exposed to currency and financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's financing business 16 are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2018 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company's reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. in addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions, alliances and dispositions include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, the assumption of liabilities and higher debt levels: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. such transactions, including the proposed red hat acquisition, present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. the company plans to fund the red hat transaction with a combination of cash and debt financing. any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on ibm's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. from time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. the company is subject to legal proceedings and investigatory risks: as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, ibm is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. the risks 17 associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note m, "contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2018 annual report to stockholders. the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled "market risk" on pages 66 and 67 of ibm's 2018 annual report to stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference. 19 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about

subsidiaries during the past five years. 9 table of contents item 1a. risk factors: downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company business: if overall demand for ibm products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company revenue and profit could be impacted. the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, artificial intelligence, agile processes and changes to the way the company works, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence, blockchain, iot, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in r&amp;d and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. if ibm is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. damage to ibm reputation could impact the company business: ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader. ibm reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. if the company brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers and talent could be impacted. risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company business: the company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. if the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or ibm costs may increase. ibm intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the company patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. the company ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. certain of the company offerings incorporate open source software licensed without warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections. if the code is no longer maintained by the relevant open source community, then it may be more difficult to make the necessary revisions to the software, including modifications to address security 10 table of contents vulnerabilities, which could impact ibm ability to market its products, mitigate cybersecurity risks or fulfill its contractual obligations to customers. cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company business: there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers, hacktivists, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies. computer hackers and others routinely attempt to attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks. such attacks may involve fraudulently inducing customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. the company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties. cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time. the company products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and may involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. these products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors. successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. in the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. in the company industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. in addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company or its customers, and may not be detected or remediated for some time afterward particularly if additional steps are required to implement remediation-related updates. cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. to date, while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate security incidents, including those associated with cybersecurity attacks, there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity attack that has a material adverse effect in the future. as a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations. as the company reliance on data grows, the potential impact of regulations on the company business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. the enactment and expansion of data protection and privacy laws and regulations around the globe, the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations, and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will continue to result in increased compliance costs and risks. any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market. 11 table of contents the company financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. in addition, certain of the company growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company financial results. the company financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers businesses; for example, certain of the company services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. due to the company global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political, health and other conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company business and the company overall results of operations. the company results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the u.s. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with u.s. and foreign data privacy requirements, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of ip protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade restrictions. further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. for example, the u.k. referendum to exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as brexit , has caused global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. the company is actively monitoring and planning for brexit. the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company financial position, results of operations and competitive position. tax matters could impact the company results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company results of operations and financial condition in future periods. the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. as countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company income taxes. local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states 12 table of contents internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the company results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans: adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company financial flexibility. further, the company results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the united states. premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. ibm 2019 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. ineffective internal controls could impact the company business and operating results: the company internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. the company use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company financial results: the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm 2019 annual report to stockholders, under critical accounting estimates. in addition, as discussed in note r, commitments &amp; contingencies, in ibm 2019 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ. the company goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may become impaired: the company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. the company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. if our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the consolidated income statement. the company depends on skilled employees and could be impacted by a shortage of critical skills: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. further, many of ibm key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company use or the value of the company equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage. the company business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely 13 table of contents manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company business. in addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company products and services and harm the company reputation. product quality issues could impact the company business and operating results: the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. if errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers business operations and harm the company business operating results. the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company results of operations, financial results and reputation. the company is exposed to currency and financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. the company financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables: the company financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm 2019 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company liquidity position. the company client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients financial conditions. if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. the company reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. in addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. risks to the company from acquisitions, alliances and dispositions include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, the assumption of liabilities and higher debt levels: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. such transactions present significant challenges and risks and 14 table of contents there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on ibm ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. from time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company control. the company is subject to legal proceedings and investigatory risks: as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, ibm is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. the risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note r, commitments &amp; contingencies in ibm 2019 annual report to stockholders. the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item 1a. entitled risk factors. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. the company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item 1a. entitled risk factors, as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company control. since the market price of ibm common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company stock at attractive prices. in addition, changes by any rating agency to the company outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company debt and equity securities. the company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 18 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the section titled market risk on pages 63 and 64 of ibm 2019 annual report to stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.
