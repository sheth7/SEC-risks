quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil, refined product, and grain prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). from time to time, we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). we also use commodity derivative instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income. finally, we enter into commodity derivative instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. see derivatives and hedging in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. the following tables provide information about our commodity derivative instruments as of december 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges fair value hedges are used to hedge certain refining inventories (which had a carrying amount of $4.4 billion as of both december 31, 2009 and 2008, and a fair value of $8.9 billion and $5.1 billion as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) and our unrecognized firm commitments ( i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future). the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. 54 table of contents cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. economic hedges economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock, refined product, and grain inventories; and manage price volatility in forecasted refinery feedstock, product, and grain purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. in addition, through august 2009, we used economic hedges to manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with the three-year earn-out agreement with alon that was entered into in connection with the sale of our krotz springs refinery, but which was settled in the third quarter of 2009 as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. trading activities these represent commodity derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes. the derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. the following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period. contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products), in billions of british thermal units (for natural gas), or in thousands of bushels (for grain). the weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products), amounts per million british thermal units (for natural gas), or amounts per bushel (for grain). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. for futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. the pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. the pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. for futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. the weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 55 table of contents december 31, 2009 wtd avg wtd avg pre-tax

table of contents interest rate risk in general, our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations. we manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. in addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. the recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly. we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31, 2009 and 2008. the following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. december 31, 2009 expected maturity dates there- fair 2010 2011 2012 2013

market risk commodity price risk as discussed in item 1. business - factors affecting operating results, valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge certain refinery feedstock and refined product inventories. valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of anticipated transactions such as anticipated feedstock, product and natural gas purchases, product sales and refining operating margins. in addition, valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes using its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions to earn additional income. the types of instruments used in valero's hedging and trading activities described above include futures, options and swaps with third parties. valero's positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with valero's stated risk management policy which has been approved by valero's board of directors. see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements under "price risk management activities" for a discussion of valero's accounting policies related to its derivative commodity instrument transactions, including valero's adoption of fasb statement no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," as amended, effective january 1, 2001. in the tables below detailing valero's open derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2000 and 1999, the total gain or (loss) as of either date on swaps is the net of the fixed price payor and receiver fair value amounts, while the total gain or (loss) on futures and options is (i) the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for fixed price payor positions, combined with (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for fixed price receiver positions. as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements under "price risk management activities," gains and losses on hedging activities are deferred and recognized when the hedged transaction occurs while gains and losses on trading activities are recognized currently. hedging activities valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge certain refinery feedstock and refined product inventories in order to reduce the impact of adverse price changes on these inventories before the conversion of the feedstock to finished products and ultimate sale. swaps and futures contracts held to hedge refining inventories at the end of 2000 and 1999 had remaining terms of less than one year. as of december 31, 2000 and 1999, 14.9% and 19.5%, respectively, of valero's refining inventory position was hedged. as of december 31, 2000 and 1999, $3.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of deferred hedge losses were included as an increase in refining inventories. the following table provides information about valero's derivative commodity instruments held to hedge refining inventories as of december 31, 2000 (which mature in 2001) and december 31, 1999 (which matured in 2000) (dollars in thousands, except amounts per barrel, or bbl, or per million british thermal units, or mmbtus). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. 37 41 december 31, 2000 december 31,

refining operating margins by locking in purchase or sales prices or components of the margins, including feedstock discounts, conventional gasoline and heating oil crack spreads and premium product differentials. swaps were also used in 2000 and 1999 to hedge anticipated purchases of natural gas used in valero's refining operations. the majority of contracts hedging anticipated transactions mature in 2001 with certain contracts extending through 2002. there were no significant explicit deferrals of hedging gains or losses related to these anticipated transactions as of the end of 2000 or 1999. the following table provides information about valero's derivative commodity instruments held to hedge anticipated feedstock and product purchases, product sales and refining margins as of

to its long-term debt obligations. valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt (see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements) and currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage such risk. 40 44quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and natural gas purchases and refined product sales (cash flow hedges). in addition, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. finally, valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. see derivative instruments in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative transactions. the types of instruments used in valero hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. valero positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with valero stated risk management policy which has been approved by valero board of directors. 52 table of contents the following tables provide information about valero derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock or product purchases and refined product sales, economic hedges held to: manage price volatility in refined product inventories, and manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock, natural gas and refined product purchases, and trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of british thermal units (for natural gas). the weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million british thermal units (for natural gas). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. the gain (loss) on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes. for futures and options, the gain (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions. additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. the weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 53 table of contents december 31, 2003

interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. in connection with the uds acquisition, valero assumed certain interest rate swap agreements entered into by uds in order to manage interest rate exposure on certain fixed-rate debt obligations. these agreements, which were all terminated in early 2003, were accounted for as speculative transactions. the following table provides information about valero long-term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (in millions, except interest rates), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. for long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. for interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. weighted-average floating

fluctuations on transactions related to its canadian operations. changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. during may 2002, valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its canadian operations that valero intended to redeem in the future. under these contracts, valero sold $400 million of canadian dollars and bought $253.4 million of u.s. dollars. the following tables present the notional amounts of these contracts by expected (contractual) maturity dates and the total fair value of the contracts as of december 31, 2003 and 2002 (in millions): december 31, 2003 expected maturity dates fair 2004 2005 2006 2007 total value notional amount $ 7.1 $ 31.7 $ 38.1 $ 94.8 $ 171.7 $ (36.6 ) december 31, 2002 expected maturity

canadian operations. as a result, valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by valero of approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts. as of december 31, 2003, valero had other commitments to purchase $16.7 million of u.s. dollars and sell $6.7 million of u.s. dollars. valero market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 9, 2004. 57 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). in addition, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. finally, valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. see derivative instruments in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative transactions. the types of instruments used in valero hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. valero positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with valero stated risk management policy which has been approved by valero board of directors. the following tables provide information about valero derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below),

and purchase contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its canadian operations. changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. during may 2002, valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its canadian operations that valero intended to redeem in the future. under these contracts, valero sold $400 million of canadian dollars and bought $253.4 million of u.s. dollars. in february 2004, valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in its canadian operations. as a result, valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by valero of approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts. as of december 31, 2004, valero had other commitments to purchase $5.0 million of u.s. dollars. valero market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before january 6, 2005. as of december 31, 2004, valero had also entered into a foreign currency exchange contract relating to the purchase of commercial paper, which requires valero to sell $20.0 million of u.s. dollars in may 2005. the effect on this contract of a hypothetical 10% change in the year-end exchange rate would be approximately $2 million. 54 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). the carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $3.8 billion and $2.1 billion as of december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $7.1 billion and $3.3 billion as of december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. we also from time to time use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). we use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. finally, we use derivative commodity instruments that we mark to market for trading purposes based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. see derivative instruments in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. the following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, economic hedges held to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, and trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of british thermal units (for natural gas). the weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million british thermal units (for natural gas). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. for futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. the fair value for futures, swaps and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. the fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. for futures and options, the fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. 45 table of contents additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price

floating rate debt. in addition, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. the following table provides information about our long-term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. for long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. for interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates.

feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). we also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income. finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. see derivative instruments in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. 51 table of contents the following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges fair value hedges are used to hedge certain recognized refining inventories (which had a carrying amount of $4.4 billion and $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a fair value of $5.1 billion and $10.0 billion as of december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively) and our unrecognized firm commitments ( i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future). the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. economic hedges economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with the alon earn-out agreement as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. trading activities these represent derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. the derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. the following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period. contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of british thermal units (for natural gas). the weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million british thermal units (for natural gas). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. for futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. the pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. the pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. for futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. the weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 52 table of contents december 31, 2008 wtd avg wtd avg pre-tax

relates to our debt obligations. we manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. in addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. the recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly. we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31, 2008 and 2007. the following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates

as the majority of them matured on or before january 31, 2014 , resulting in a gain of $12 million in the first quarter of 2014. 55 table of contentsrisk factors 12 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined products. our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined products. these in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of u.s. and international suppliers, levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of u.s. and global economies, u.s. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories. economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the u.s. and other countries. lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins. a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as louisiana light sweet (lls) and brent crude oils. these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance. the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline 12 table of contents and diesel fuels. certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. for example, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has, in recent years, adopted final rules making more stringent the national ambient air quality standards (naaqs) for ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, and the u.s. epa is considering further revisions to the naaqs. emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities, which may result in increased capital expenditures. governmental restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions including so-called cap-and-trade programs targeted at reducing carbon dioxide emissions could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business, and an increase in the cost of, and reduction in demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations . a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east, africa, asia, north america, and south america. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. these restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. actions by both the u.s. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future. we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture. we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, 13 table of contents governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture . we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets. we own and lease rail cars for our operations. rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations. new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for compliance. for example, in 2014 the u.s. department of transportation (dot) and transport canada (tc) issued proposed regulations for rail car standards and railroad operating requirements for flammable liquids with particular emphasis on shipments of crude oil, gasoline, and ethanol. the regulations as proposed would require significant physical modifications to rail cars. we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with these and other future regulations of rail transportation to the extent they are applicable to us. competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage . the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business, we do not have a company-owned retail network. many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners. our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. in addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements. our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we currently maintain investment-grade ratings by standard &amp; poor's ratings services (s&amp;p), moody's investors service (moody's), and fitch ratings (fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be 14 table of contents evaluated independently of any other rating. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. in addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. as a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. from time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. we have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. in addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. our refineries are our principal operating assets. as a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate. a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in a loss of sensitive business information, systems interruption, or the disruption of our business operations. there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators. workers at various of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, future 15 table of contents federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods. we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity . our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. as protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns. we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. as a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance . we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. we may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions . we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us. 16 table of contents one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, vlp, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp, a publicly traded master limited partnership. our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to vlp. liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. if our spin-off of cst (the spin-off ), or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off, were determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability. we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (irs) substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualified as tax-free under sections 355 and 361 of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), and that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off qualified for favorable treatment. the irs did not rule, however, on whether the spin-off satisfied certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. instead, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the private letter ruling. in connection with the private letter ruling, we also obtained an opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm, substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off qualified under sections 355 and 361 of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by cst and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. furthermore, notwithstanding the private letter ruling, the irs could determine on audit that the spin-off or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings we or cst have made or provided to the irs are incorrect or incomplete, or that the spin-off or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the spin-off. if the spin-off ultimately were determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of cst common stock in the spin-off generally would be treated as receiving a spin-off of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cst common stock received by such holder. any such spin-off would be a dividend to the extent of our current earnings and profits as of the end of 2013, and any accumulated earnings and profits. any amount that exceeded our relevant earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such holder's tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount generally being taxed as a capital gain. in addition, we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of cst common stock distributed to our holders on the spin-off date over our tax basis in such shares of cst common stock. moreover, we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately were determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off were taxable. under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with cst in connection with the spin-off, we generally are responsible for any taxes imposed on us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment. however, if the spin-off and/or such internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by cst or its subsidiaries, cst would be responsible for all such taxes. if we were to become liable 17 table of contents for taxes under the tax matters agreement, that liability could have a material adverse effect on us. the spin-off is more fully described in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge: inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (lifo) basis) differ from our previous year-end lifo inventory levels and forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. we use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows. our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes trading purposes december 31, 2014: gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices $ (127 ) $ (2 ) 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices 126 7 december 31, 2013: gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices (91 ) 3 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices 91 (2 ) see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31, 2014 . 52 table of contents compliance program price risk we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. to manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. as of december 31, 2014 , there was no gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. interest rate risk the following table provides information about our debt instruments, excluding capital lease obligations

contentsrisk factors 12 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined products. our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined products. these in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of u.s. and international suppliers, levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of u.s. and global economies, u.s. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories. economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the u.s. and other countries. lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future

environmental matters could increase in the future. current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. for example, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has, in recent years, adopted final rules making more stringent the national ambient air quality standards (naaqs) for ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, and the u.s. epa is considering further revisions to the naaqs. emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more

reducing carbon dioxide emissions and low carbon fuel standards could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business, and an increase in the cost of, and reduction in demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. in addition, in 2015, the u.s., canada, and the u.k. participated in the united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement. the paris agreement will be open for signing on april 22, 2016, and will require countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set ghg emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various u.s. states or at the u.s. federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg emissions in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations . a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east, africa, asia, north america, and south america. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. 13 table of contents in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. these restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. actions by both the u.s. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future. we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture. we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture . we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets. we own and lease rail cars for our operations. rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations. new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for compliance. for example, in may 2014, the u.s. department of transportation (dot) issued an order requiring rail carriers to provide certain notifications to state agencies along routes used by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil. in addition, in november 2014, the u.s. dot issued a final rule regarding safety training standards under the rail safety improvement act of 2008. the rule required each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews. in may 2015, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the federal railroad administration issued new final rules for enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for high-hazard flammable trains. although we do not believe recently adopted rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, further changes in law, regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us. competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage . the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business, we do not have a company-owned retail network. many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. 14 table of contents uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners. our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. in addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements. our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we currently maintain investment-grade ratings by standard &amp; poor's ratings services (s&amp;p), moody's investors service (moody's), and fitch ratings (fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. in addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. as a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. from time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. we have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. in addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. our refineries are our principal operating assets. as a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate. 15 table of contents a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in a loss of sensitive business information, systems interruption, or the disruption of our business operations. there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators. workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, future federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods. we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity . our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. as protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns. we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. as a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance . we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax 16 table of contents liabilities in the future. many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. we may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions . we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, vlp, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp, a publicly traded master limited partnership. our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to vlp. liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. if our spin-off of cst (the spin-off ), or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off, were determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we and certain of our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability. we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (irs) substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualified as tax-free under sections 355 and 361 of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), and that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off qualified for favorable treatment. the irs did not rule, however, on whether the spin-off satisfied certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. instead, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the private letter ruling. in connection with the private letter ruling, we also obtained an opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm, substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off qualified under sections 355 and 361 of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by cst and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. furthermore, notwithstanding the private letter ruling, the irs could determine on audit that the spin-off or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings we or cst have made or provided to the irs are incorrect or incomplete, or that the spin-off or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the spin-off. if the spin-off ultimately were determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of cst common stock in the spin-off generally would be treated as receiving a spin-off of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cst common stock received by such holder. any such spin-off would be a dividend to the extent of our current earnings and profits as of the end of 2013, and any accumulated earnings and profits. any amount that exceeded our relevant earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such holder's tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount generally being taxed as a capital gain. in addition, we would 17 table of contents recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of cst common stock distributed to our holders on the spin-off date over our tax basis in such shares of cst common stock. moreover, we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately were determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off were taxable. under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with cst in connection with the spin-off, we generally are responsible for any taxes imposed on us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment. however, if the spin-off and/or such internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by cst or its subsidiaries, cst would be responsible for all such taxes. if we were to become liable for taxes under the tax matters agreement, that liability could have a material adverse effect on us. the spin-off is more fully described in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of: inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a lifo basis) differ from our previous year-end lifo inventory levels and forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. we use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows. 52 table of contents our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes trading purposes december 31, 2015: gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices $ (45 ) $ 10% decrease in underlying

of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31, 2015 . compliance program price risk we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and ghg emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. to manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. as of december 31, 2015 , there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. 53 table of contents interest rate risk the following

commitments to purchase $292 million of u.s. dollars. our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as all of them matured on or before january 31, 2016, resulting in a gain of $10 million in the first quarter of 2016. 54 table of contentsrisk factors 11 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum products. our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products. these in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of u.s. and international suppliers, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of u.s. and global economies, u.s. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories. economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the u.s. and other countries. lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins. a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as louisiana light sweet (lls) and brent crude oils. these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance. the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, 11 table of contents pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, and characteristics and composition of fuels, including gasoline and diesel. certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, discontinue use of certain process units ( e.g ., hf alkylation), or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. for example, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has, in recent years, adopted final rules making more stringent the national ambient air quality standards (naaqs) for ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities, which may result in increased capital expenditures. governmental regulations regarding ghg emissions and low carbon fuel standards could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business, and an increase in the cost of, and reduction in demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. in addition, in 2015, the u.s., canada, and the u.k. participated in the united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement. the paris agreement, which was signed by the u.s. in april 2016, requires countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set ghg emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. while the current administration is considering withdrawal from the paris agreement, there are no guarantees that it will not be implemented. restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various u.s. states or at the u.s. federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg emissions in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. compliance with the u.s. environmental protection agency renewable fuel standard could adversely affect our performance. the u.s. epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard (rfs) pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007. the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the united states. a renewable identification number (rin) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the u.s. as a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the u.s. epa's quota 12 table of contents and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program. we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins. we cannot predict the future prices of rins. rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including u.s. epa regulations, the availability of rins for purchase, the price at which rins can be purchased, and levels of transportation fuels produced, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the u.s. epa's rfs mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations . a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east, africa, asia, north america, and south america. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. these restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. actions by both the u.s. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future. we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture. we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture . we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets. we own and lease rail cars for our operations. rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations. new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for compliance. for example, in may 2014, the u.s. department of transportation (dot) issued an order requiring rail carriers to provide certain notifications to state agencies along routes used by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil. in addition, in november 2014, the u.s. dot issued a final rule regarding safety training standards under the rail safety improvement act of 2008. the rule required each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews. in may 2015, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration (phmsa) and the federal railroad administration (fra) issued new final rules for enhanced 13 table of contents tank car standards and operational controls for high-hazard flammable trains. in august 2016, phmsa and fra adopted a final rule expanding the requirements and mandating additional controls for enhanced tank cars. although we do not believe recently adopted rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, further changes in law, regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us. competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage . the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business, we do not have a company-owned retail network. many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners. our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. in addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements. our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we currently maintain investment-grade ratings by standard &amp; poor's ratings services, moody's investors service, and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt. ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. in addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. as a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. 14 table of contents from time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. we have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. in addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. our refineries are our principal operating assets. as a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate. a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in a loss of sensitive business information, systems interruption, or the disruption of our business operations. there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators. workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, future federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods. we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity . our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. as protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad 15 table of contents exclusions. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns. we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. as a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance . we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. we may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions . we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, vlp, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp, a publicly traded master limited partnership. our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to vlp. liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. if our spin-off of cst (the spin-off ), or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off, were determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we and certain of our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability. we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (irs) substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualified as tax-free under sections 355 and 361 of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), and that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off qualified for favorable treatment. the irs did not rule, however, on whether the spin-off satisfied certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. instead, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the private letter ruling. in connection with the private letter ruling, we also obtained an 16 table of contents opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm, substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off qualified under sections 355 and 361 of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by cst and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. furthermore, notwithstanding the private letter ruling, the irs could determine on audit that the spin-off or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings we or cst have made or provided to the irs are incorrect or incomplete, or that the spin-off or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the spin-off. if the spin-off ultimately were determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of cst common stock in the spin-off generally would be treated as receiving a spin-off of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cst common stock received by such holder. any such spin-off would be a dividend to the extent of our current earnings and profits as of the end of 2013, and any accumulated earnings and profits. any amount that exceeded our relevant earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such holder's tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount generally being taxed as a capital gain. in addition, we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of cst common stock distributed to our holders on the spin-off date over our tax basis in such shares of cst common stock. moreover, we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately were determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off were taxable. under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with cst in connection with the spin-off, we generally are responsible for any taxes imposed on us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment. however, if the spin-off and/or such internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by cst or its subsidiaries, cst would be responsible for all such taxes. if we were to become liable for taxes under the tax matters agreement, that liability could have a material adverse effect on us. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 64 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of: inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a lifo basis) differ from our previous year-end lifo inventory levels and forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. we use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows. our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes trading purposes december 31, 2016: gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices $ 61 $ (22 ) 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices (61 ) 11 december 31, 2015: gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices (45 ) 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices 45 5 see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31, 2016 . 64 table of contents compliance program price risk we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and ghg emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. to manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. as of december 31, 2016 , there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. interest rate risk the following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest

(b) as of december 31, 2016 , we had an interest rate swap associated with $51 million of our floating rate debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 3.85 percent. the fair value of the swap was immaterial. we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31, 2015 . foreign currency risk as of december 31, 2016 , we had commitments to purchase $374 million of u.s. dollars. our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as all of them matured on or before february 1, 2017 . 65 table of contentsrisk factors 16 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum products. our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products. these in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of u.s. and international suppliers, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of u.s. and global economies, u.s. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories. economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the u.s. and other countries. lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins. a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as louisiana light sweet (lls) and brent crude oils. these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance. the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, 16 table of contents pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, and characteristics and composition of fuels, including gasoline and diesel. certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, discontinue use of certain process units, or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. for example, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) recently adopted the residual risk and technology review rule (rtr) adding new standards for air toxic emissions, among other requirements. emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities, which may result in increased capital expenditures. governmental regulations regarding ghg emissions and low carbon fuel standards could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business, and an increase in the cost of, and reduction in demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. in addition, in 2015, the u.s., canada, and the u.k. participated in the united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement. the paris agreement, which was signed by the u.s. in april 2016, requires countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set ghg emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. while the current u.s. administration announced its intent to withdraw from the paris agreement in june 2017, there are no guarantees that it will not be implemented in the u.s., or in part by u.s. states or local governments. restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various u.s. states or at the u.s. federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. some members within the scientific community believe that the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the earth's atmosphere, among other reasons, may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. if any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. 17 table of contents compliance with the u.s. environmental protection agency renewable fuel standard could adversely affect our performance. the u.s. epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard (rfs) pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007. the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the u.s. a renewable identification number (rin) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the u.s. as a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the u.s. epa's quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program. we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins. we cannot predict the future prices of rins. rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including u.s. epa regulations, the availability of rins for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the u.s. epa's rfs mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations . a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east, africa, asia, north america, and south america. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. these restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. actions by both the u.s. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future. any attempt by the u.s. government to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the current u.s. administration has questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements, such as the north american free trade agreement, and has withdrawn the u.s. from others such as the trans-pacific partnership. the current u.s. administration has also raised the possibility of greater restrictions on trade generally, and significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the u.s. changes in u.s. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment could adversely affect our business. for example, the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources, increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products. while there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood, timing, and details of any such policies and reforms, if the current u.s. administration takes action to withdraw from, or materially modify, existing 18 table of contents international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture. we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture . we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets. we own and lease rail cars for our operations. rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations. new laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws and regulations, are frequently enacted or proposed, and could result in increased expenditures for compliance, either directly through costs for our owned and leased rail assets, or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators. for example, in may 2014, the u.s. department of transportation (dot) issued an emergency order requiring rail carriers to provide certain notifications to state agencies along routes used by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil. in addition, in november 2014, the federal railroad administration (fra) issued a final rule regarding safety training standards under the rail safety improvement act of 2008. the rule required each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews. in may 2015, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration (phmsa), in coordination with the fra, issued new final rules for enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for high-hazard flammable trains. in august 2016, phmsa adopted a final rule expanding the requirements and mandating additional controls for enhanced tank cars, as required by the fixing america's surface transportation (fast) act of 2015. while some recent actions including (1) a december 2017 statement that phmsa intends to initiate rulemaking to rescind portions of its may 2015 rule; and (2) an april 2017 final rule from fra that delays certain training-program requirements have provided some regulatory relief, the general trend has been toward greater regulation. we do not believe recently adopted rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, although further changes in law, regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us. competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage . the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business in 2013, we do not have a company-owned retail network. many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. 19 table of contents some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners. our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. in addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements. our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we currently maintain investment-grade ratings by standard &amp; poor's ratings services, moody's investors service, and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt. ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. in addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. as a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. from time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. we have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. in addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. our refineries are our principal operating assets. as a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products, and could increase instability in 20 table of contents the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate. a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in a loss of intellectual property, proprietary information or employee, customer or vendor data; public disclosure of sensitive information; increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events; systems interruption; or the disruption of our business operations. a breach could also originate from, or compromise, our customers' and vendors' or other third-party networks outside of our control. a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers and vendors. there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements. our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators. workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, future federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods. we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity . our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. as protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. 21 table of contents large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns. we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. as a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance . we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. on december 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax reform) was enacted. among other things, tax reform reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent (beginning in 2018) and implements a new system of taxation for non-u.s. earnings, including by imposing a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries. beginning in 2018, tax reform also generally will (i) limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our adjusted taxable income (plus 100 percent of our business interest income) for the year and (ii) permit us to offset only 80 percent (rather than 100 percent) of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017. while we are currently evaluating the effects of tax reform, including the one-time deemed repatriation tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, we do not expect that the provisions of tax reform, taken as a whole, will have any adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, or financial condition. in the absence of guidance on various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of tax reform, we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying tax reform, but it is possible that the internal revenue service (irs) could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions, which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition. we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions . we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, vlp, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp, a publicly traded master limited partnership. our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to vlp. liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 22 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 62 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of: inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a lifo basis) differ from our previous year-end lifo inventory levels and forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. we use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows. our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. 62 table of contents the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes trading purposes december 31, 2017: gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices $ (47 ) $ 4 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices 47 (2 ) december 31, 2016: gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices 61 (22 ) 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices (61 )

market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and ghg emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. to manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. as of december 31, 2017 , there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. 63 table of contents interest rate risk

(b) as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had an interest rate swap associated with $49 million and $51 million, respectively, of our floating rate debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 3.85 percent as of each of those reporting dates. the fair value of the swap was immaterial for all periods presented. foreign currency risk as of december 31, 2017 , we had commitments to purchase $507 million of u.s. dollars. our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as all of them matured on or before january 31, 2018 . 64 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum products. our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products. these in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of u.s. and international suppliers, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of u.s. and global economies, u.s. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories. economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the u.s. and other countries. lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins. a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as louisiana light sweet (lls) and brent crude oils. these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance. the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, 14 table of contents pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, and characteristics and composition of fuels, including gasoline and diesel. certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, discontinue use of certain process units, or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. for example, the international maritime organization (imo) will be implementing a new regulation for a global sulphur cap for marine bunker fuels by the year 2020 (imo 2020). under the imo 2020 cap, vessels will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur content of no more than 0.50 percent beginning in january 2020, versus the current sulphur limit of 3.50 percent. while there are many uncertainties, imo 2020 could affect our business by creating the continued need for new and updated process units necessary to produce the low sulphur marine fuel, and could increase the costs of our products. in addition, in 2015, the u.s., canada, and the u.k. participated in the united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement. the paris agreement, which was signed by the u.s. in april 2016, requires countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set ghg emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. while the current u.s. administration announced its intent to withdraw from the paris agreement in june 2017, under the agreement's terms the earliest the u.s. can withdraw is 2020. there are no guarantees that the agreement will not be re-implemented in the u.s., or re-implemented in part by specific u.s. states or local governments. however, the paris agreement could still affect our operations in canada, the u.k., ireland, and latin america. restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various u.s. states, at the u.s. federal level, or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. some members within the scientific community believe that the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the earth's atmosphere, among other reasons, may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. if any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. compliance with the u.s. environmental protection agency renewable fuel standard could adversely affect our performance. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has implemented a renewable fuel standard (rfs) pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007. the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into 15 table of contents transportation fuels consumed in the u.s. a renewable identification number (rin) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the u.s. as a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the u.s. epa's quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program. we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins. we cannot predict the future prices of rins. rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including u.s. epa regulations, the availability of rins for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the u.s. epa's rfs mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations . a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east, africa, asia, north america, and south america. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. these restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. actions by both the u.s. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future. any attempt by the u.s. government to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the current u.s. administration has questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements. for example, the administration has withdrawn the u.s. from the trans-pacific partnership, and has indicated that the administration may withdraw the u.s. from the north american free trade agreement (nafta) in order to encourage the u.s. congress to vote on ratification of the united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca), which was signed in november 2018 and is intended to be the successor to nafta. in addition, the administration has implemented and proposed various trade tariffs, which have resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on u.s. goods. changes in u.s. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment could adversely affect our business. for example, the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources, increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products. while there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood, timing, and details of any such policies and reforms, if the current u.s. administration takes action to withdraw from, or materially modify, existing international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 16 table of contents we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture. we use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture . we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets. we own and lease rail cars for our operations. rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations. new laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws and regulations, are frequently enacted or proposed, and could result in increased expenditures for compliance, either directly through costs for our owned and leased rail assets, or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators. for example, in the past several years, the department of transportation, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, and the federal railroad administration have issued orders and rules, pursuant to the rail safety improvement act of 2008, fixing america's surface transportation act of 2015 and other statutory authorities, concerning such matters as enhanced tank car standards, operational controls, safety training programs, and notification requirements. while some recent actions have provided some regulatory relief, the general trend has been toward greater regulation. we do not believe these orders and rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, although further changes in law, regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us. competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage . the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business in 2013, we do not have a company-owned retail network. many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners. our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may 17 table of contents be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. in addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements. our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we currently maintain investment-grade ratings by standard &amp; poor's ratings services, moody's investors service, and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt. ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. in addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. as a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. from time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. we have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. in addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. our refineries are our principal operating assets. as a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate. a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in (i) a loss of intellectual property, proprietary information, or employee, customer or vendor data; (ii) public disclosure of sensitive information; (iii) increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity events, such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; (iv) systems interruption; (v) disruption of our business operations; (vi) remediation costs for repairs of system damage; (vii) reputational damage that 18 table of contents adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and (viii) damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term stockholder value. a breach could also originate from, or compromise, our customers' and vendors' or other third-party networks outside of our control. a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and governmental authorities (u.s. and non-u.s.). there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements. in addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the european union general data protection regulation and recent california legislation, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result. our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators. workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, future federal, state, or foreign labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods. we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity . our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. as protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. 19 table of contents large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns. we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. as a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance . we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. on december 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax reform) was enacted. among other things, tax reform reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and implements a new system of taxation for non-u.s. earnings, including by imposing a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries. tax reform also generally will (i) limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our adjusted taxable income (plus 100 percent of our business interest income) for the year and (ii) permit us to offset only 80 percent (rather than 100 percent) of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017. we have evaluated the effects of tax reform, including the one-time deemed repatriation tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the provisions of tax reform, taken as a whole, did not have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, or financial condition. we have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying tax reform, but it is possible that the internal revenue service (irs) could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions, which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition. we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions . we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us. changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate (libor), or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates. on july 27, 2017, the financial conduct authority (fca) in the u.k. announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021. it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. in the future, we may need to renegotiate our revolving credit facility (the valero revolver) or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of libor may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. in addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of libor. disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 20 table of contents changes in the u.k.'s economic and other relationships with the european union could adversely affect us. in june 2016, the u.k. elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum (brexit). withdrawal negotiations have yet to produce an overall structure for an ongoing relationship between the u.k. and the european union following brexit. the ongoing uncertainty and potential imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade as a result of brexit could negatively impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships, and financial performance. the ultimate effects of brexit will depend on the specific terms of any agreement reached by the u.k. and the european union. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 60 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options to manage the volatility of: inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a lifo basis) differ from our previous year-end lifo inventory levels; and forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. the following sensitivity analysis includes all of our derivative instruments entered into for purposes other than trading with which we have market risk (in millions): december 31, 2018 2017 gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices $ 2 $ (43 ) 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices (6 ) 45 60 table of contents see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31, 2018 . compliance program price risk we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. to manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material. see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. interest rate risk the following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. december 31, 2018 expected maturity dates

(b) as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had an interest rate swap associated with $40 million and $49 million, respectively, of our floating rate debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 3.85 percent as of each of those reporting dates. the fair value of the swap was immaterial for all periods presented. foreign currency risk as of december 31, 2018 , we had commitments to purchase $441 million of u.s. dollars. our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as all of them matured on or before january 31, 2019 . 61 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum products. our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products. these in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of u.s. and international suppliers, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of u.s. and global economies, u.s. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories. economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the u.s. and other countries. lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins. a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as louisiana light sweet (lls) and brent crude oils. these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 10 table of contents compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance. the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, and characteristics and composition of fuels, including gasoline and diesel. certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, discontinue use of certain process units, or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. for example, in 2015, the u.s., canada, and the u.k. participated in the united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement. the paris agreement, which was signed by the u.s. in april 2016, requires countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set ghg emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. in november 2019, the current u.s. administration served notice on the united nations that the u.s. would withdraw from the paris agreement in 2020. there are no guarantees that the paris agreement will not be re-implemented in the u.s. or re-implemented in part by specific u.s. states or local governments. regardless, the paris agreement could still affect our operations in canada, the u.k., ireland, and latin america. restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various u.s. states, at the u.s. federal level, or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. investor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels, and sustainability could adversely affect our business and our stock price. there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, to promote the divestment of shares of energy companies, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies. if these efforts are successful, our stock price and our ability to access capital markets may be negatively impacted. members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on sustainability practices, including practices related to ghgs and climate change, in the energy industry. as a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices. additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock. 11 table of contents if we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors, we may lose investors, our stock price may be negatively impacted and our reputation may be negatively affected. severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. severe weather events, such as storms, droughts, or floods, could have an adverse effect on our operations. members within the scientific community believe that an increasing concentration of ghg emissions in the earth's atmosphere may contribute to climate changes that can have significant physical effects, including an increased frequency and severity of these types of events. compliance with the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) renewable fuel standard (rfs) could adversely affect our performance. the u.s. epa has implemented the rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007. the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol and diesel) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the u.s. a renewable identification number (rin) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the u.s. as a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the u.s. epa's quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program. we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins. we cannot predict the future prices of rins. rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including u.s. epa regulations, the availability of rins for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the u.s. epa's rfs mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations . a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east, africa, asia, north america, and south america. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. these restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. actions by both the u.s. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future. any attempt by the u.s. government to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the current u.s. administration has questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements. for example, the administration withdrew the u.s. from the trans-pacific partnership. in addition, the administration has 12 table of contents implemented and proposed various trade tariffs, which have resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on u.s. goods. changes in u.s. social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment could adversely affect our business. for example, the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources, increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products. while there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood, timing, and details of any such policies and reforms, if the current u.s. administration takes action to withdraw from, or materially modify, existing international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture. we use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture . we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets. we own and lease rail cars for our operations. rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, as well as industry practices and customs. new laws and regulations, and changes in existing laws and regulations, are frequently enacted or proposed, and could result in increased expenditures for compliance, either directly through costs for our owned and leased rail assets, or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators. for example, in the past several years, the department of transportation and various agencies within the department of transportation, including the surface transportation board, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, and the federal railroad administration, have issued orders and rules pursuant to the federal railroad safety act of 1970, the interstate commerce commission termination act of 1995, the rail safety improvement act of 2008, fixing america's surface transportation act of 2015 and other statutory authorities concerning such matters as enhanced tank car standards, positive train control and other operational controls, safety training programs, and notification requirements. the general trend has been toward greater regulation of rail transportation over recent years. we do not believe these orders and rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, although further changes in law, regulations, or industry practices could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us. competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage . the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business in 2013, we do not have a company-owned retail network. 13 table of contents many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners. our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. in addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements. our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we currently maintain investment-grade ratings by standard &amp; poor's ratings services, moody's investors service, and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt. ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs may increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. in addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. as a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. from time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. we have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. in addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 14 table of contents a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. our refineries are our principal operating assets. as a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate. a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in (i) a loss of intellectual property, proprietary information, or employee, customer or vendor data; (ii) public disclosure of sensitive information; (iii) increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity events, such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; (iv) systems interruption; (v) disruption of our business operations; (vi) remediation costs for repairs of system damage; (vii) reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and (viii) damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term stockholder value. a breach could also originate from, or compromise, our customers' and vendors' or other third-party networks outside of our control. a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and governmental authorities (u.s. and non-u.s.). there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements. increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business. along with our own data and information in the normal course of our business, we and our partners collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations. the transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. this data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local levels in many areas of our business, including data privacy and security laws such as the european union (eu) general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the california consumer privacy act (ccpa). the gdpr applies to activities regarding personal data that may be conducted by us, directly or indirectly through vendors and subcontractors, from an establishment in the eu. as interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to incur additional costs. failure to comply could result in significant penalties of up to a maximum of 4 percent of our global turnover that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows. the ccpa, which came into effect on january 1, 2020, gives california residents specific rights in relation to their personal information, requires that companies take certain actions, including notifications for security 15 table of contents incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us, directly or indirectly, from california residents. as interpretation and enforcement of the ccpa evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows. the gdpr and ccpa, as well as other data privacy laws that may become applicable to our business, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result. our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators. workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, future federal, state, or foreign labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods. we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity . our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. as protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns. we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. as a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 16 table of contents compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance . we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. on december 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax reform) was enacted. among other things, tax reform reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and implemented a new system of taxation for non-u.s. earnings, including by imposing a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries. tax reform also generally (i) repealed the manufacturing deduction we previously were able to claim, (ii) resulted in a shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system of taxation, resulting in a minimum tax on the income of international subsidiaries (the gilti tax) rather than a tax deferral on such earnings in certain circumstances, (iii) limits our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our adjusted taxable income (plus 100 percent of our business interest income) for the year and (iv) permits us to offset only 80 percent (rather than 100 percent) of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017. we have evaluated the effects of tax reform, including the one-time deemed repatriation tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the provisions of tax reform, taken as a whole, did not have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, or financial condition. we have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying tax reform, but it is possible that the internal revenue service (irs) could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions, which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition. our investments in joint ventures and other entities decrease our ability to manage risk. we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners and in some entities in which we have no ownership or control. our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint-venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our, or our joint ventures', financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions . we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us. changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate (libor), or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates. on july 27, 2017, the financial conduct authority in the u.k. announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021. it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness 17 table of contents will develop. in the future, we may need to renegotiate our financial agreements, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility (the valero revolver), or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of libor may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. in addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of libor. disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. changes in the u.k.'s economic and other relationships with the eu could adversely affect us. in june 2016, the u.k. elected to withdraw from the eu in a national referendum (brexit). the u.k. withdrew from the eu on january 31, 2020, consistent with the terms of the eu-u.k. withdrawal agreement. the terms of that agreement provide for a transition period, from january 31, 2020 to december 31, 2020, during which the trading relationship between the u.k. and the eu will remain the same while the u.k. and the eu try to negotiate an agreement regarding their future trading relationship. the ultimate effects of brexit will depend on whether an agreement is reached, or on the specific terms of any such agreement that is reached, either of which outcomes could adversely impact the ability to trade freely between the u.k. and the eu at the end of the transition period and could negatively impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships, and financial performance. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 57 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), renewable diesel, grain (primarily corn), renewable diesel feedstocks, and natural gas used in our operations. to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options to manage the volatility of: inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a lifo basis) differ from our previous year-end lifo inventory levels; and forecasted feedstock and refined petroleum product purchases, refined petroleum product sales, renewable diesel sales, or natural gas purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. the following sensitivity analysis includes all of our derivative instruments entered into for purposes other than trading with which we have market risk (in millions): december 31, 2019 2018 gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices $ (39 ) $ 2 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices 38 (6 ) see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31, 2019 . compliance program price risk we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. to manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material. see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. 57 table of contents interest rate risk the following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to

(a) as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , our floating rate debt due in 2020 and 2019 includes $348 million and $109 million , respectively, associated with borrowings under the ienova revolver for the construction of terminals in mexico by central mexico terminals. the ienova revolver is only available to the operations of central mexico terminals, and its creditors do not have recourse against us. (b) excludes unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. (c) as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had an interest rate swap associated with $36 million and $40 million, respectively, of our floating rate debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 3.85 percent as of each of those reporting dates. the fair value of the swap was immaterial for all periods presented. foreign currency risk as of december 31, 2019 , we had foreign currency contracts to purchase $739 million of u.s. dollars and $2.3 billion of u.s. dollar equivalent canadian dollars. our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as all of them matured on or before february 15, 2020 . 58 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk....................... 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and natural gas purchases and product sales (cash flow hedges). in addition, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment under fasb 133. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are reported currently in earnings. finally, valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes using its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions to earn additional income. see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of valero's accounting policies related to its derivative commodity instrument transactions, including valero's adoption of fasb statement no. 133 effective january 1, 2001. the types of instruments used in valero's hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. valero's positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with valero's stated risk management policy which has been approved by valero's board of directors. the following table provides information about valero's derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: o fair value hedges - held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, o cash flow hedges - held to hedge forecasted feedstock purchases and product sales, o economic hedges - (i) held to manage price volatility in refined product inventories, and (ii) held to manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock, natural gas and refined product purchases, and o trading activity - held or issued for trading purposes. contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of british thermal units (for natural gas). the weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million british thermal units (for natural gas). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. the gain or (loss) on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes. for futures and options, the gain or (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions, and (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions. additionally, for futures, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for both long and short positions. all derivative commodity instruments assumed in connection with the uds acquisition were 50 recorded at fair value on december 31, 2001; thus no gain or (loss) is shown in the tables below. accordingly, swaps assumed in the uds acquisition have zero fair value as of december 31, 2001 as the weighted average pay price is equal to the weighted average receive price. additionally, for futures and options assumed in the uds acquisition, the contract amount is equal to the fair value of the assumed contracts as of december 31, 2001. 51 december 31, 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ wtd avg wtd avg contract pay receive contract fair gain volumes price price value value (loss) -------- ------- ------- -------- -------- --------- fair value hedges: swaps -

obligations. valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt (see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements). as discussed in note 17 under "interest rate risk," in connection with the uds acquisition, valero assumed certain interest rate swap agreements entered into in order to manage exposure to changing interest rates on certain fixed-rate debt obligations. the following table provides information about the assumed long-term debt and interest rate swaps, both of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. for long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted 54 average interest rates by expected maturity dates, are presented. for interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. weighted average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. december 31, 2001

short-term foreign exchange or purchase contracts. 55quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk................... 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and natural gas purchases and refined product sales (cash flow hedges). in addition, valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. finally, valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. the types of instruments used in valero's hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. valero's positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with valero's stated risk management policy which has been approved by valero's board of directors. the following tables provide information about valero's derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2002 and 2001 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: o fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, o cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock or product purchases and refined product sales, o economic hedges held to: o manage price volatility in refined product inventories, and o manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock, natural gas and refined product purchases, and o trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of british thermal units (for natural gas). the weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million british thermal units (for natural gas). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. the gain (loss) on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes. for futures and options, the gain (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions. additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. the weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. all derivative commodity instruments assumed in connection with the uds acquisition were recorded at fair value on december 31, 2001; therefore no gain (loss) is shown as of that date in the tables below. accordingly, swaps assumed in the uds acquisition have zero fair value as of december 31, 2001 as the weighted-average pay price is equal to the weighted-average receive price. additionally, for futures and options assumed in the uds acquisition, the contract amount is equal to the fair value of the assumed contracts

of the exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. in connection with the uds acquisition, valero assumed certain interest rate swap agreements entered into in order to manage interest rate exposure on certain fixed-rate debt obligations. the following table provides information about valero's long-term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (in millions, except interest rates), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. for long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. for interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. weighted-average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. december 31, 2002

contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its canadian operations. during may 2002, valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its canadian operations. under these contracts, valero sold $400 million of canadian dollars and bought $253.4 million of u.s. dollars. as of december 31, 2002, these contracts had a fair value of $6.1 million. the gain recognized in income on these contracts, which was $6.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2002, was offset by a loss of $2.4 million recognized in income from the effect of the exchange rate fluctuation on the hedged investment for the year. these contracts mature as follows (in millions): year ending notional

valero had commitments to purchase $33.8 million of u.s. dollars. valero's market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 3, 2003. 54quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 46 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). the carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $7.1 billion as of both december 31, 2006 and 2005. from time to time, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). we also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. see derivative instruments in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. 46 table of contents the following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges which are used to hedge our recognized refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments ( i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future); cash flow hedges which are used to hedge our forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; economic hedges (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) which are used to: - manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and - manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. for our economic hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. the following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period, and therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income pending consummation of the forecasted transactions. contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of british thermal units (for natural gas). the weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million british thermal units (for natural gas). volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. for futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. the pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. the pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. for futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. the weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike price. 47 table of contents december 31, 2006 contract volumes wtd avg pay price wtd

debt instruments that were being hedged. 50 table of contents foreign currency risk we enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our canadian operations. changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. as of december 31, 2006, we had commitments to purchase $290 million of u.s. dollars. our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before january 19, 2007, resulting in a 2007 gain of $4 million. 51 table of contents
