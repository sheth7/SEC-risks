engaged in exploration and production, oil sands mining and integrated gas with operations in the u.s., angola, canada, e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya, norway, poland and the u.k. we are based in houston, texas with our corporate headquarters at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and a telephone number of (713) 629-6600. on june 30, 2011, the spin-off of marathon's downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. marathon stockholders at the close of business on the record date of june 27, 2011 received one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon common stock held. a private letter ruling received in june 2011 from the irs affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in 2011 and 2010, with additional information in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. strategy and results summary assets within our three segments are at various stages in their lifecycle: base, growth or exploration. we have a stable group of base assets, which include our osm and ig segments and e&amp;p assets in e.g., libya, norway, the u.k. and certain u.s. operations. these assets generate much of the cash that will be available for investment in our growth assets and exploration projects. growth assets are where we expect to make significant investment in order to realize oil and gas production and reserve increases. we are focused on u.s. liquid hydrocarbon growth by developing unconventional liquids-rich plays, including the eagle ford and bakken shales, and the oklahoma resource basins. in addition to the u.s. shale plays, growth assets include deepwater discoveries and developments offshore angola, our canadian in-situ assets, certain gulf of mexico blocks and the kurdistan region of iraq. we also invest in exploration prospects that have significant value potential. our areas of exploration are e.g., ethiopia, gabon, the gulf of mexico, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya, norway and poland. we continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, with a previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion of non-core assets over the period of 2011 through 2013. for the two-year period ended december 31, 2012 , we entered into agreements for approximately $1.3 billion in divestitures, of which $785 million were completed. the remaining $545 million in asset sales were completed by february 22, 2013 . we ended 2012 with proved reserves of 2 bboe, a 12 percent increase over 2011 . average sales volumes were 282 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbon, 902 mmcfd of natural gas and 47 mbbld of synthetic crude oil, with 62 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from international operations, for which average realizations have exceeded wti crude prices. during 2012, we invested in the development of assets totaling $5.4 billion in capital, investment and exploration spending and made acquisitions of approximately $1 billion. we expect continued spending, primarily funded with cash flow from operations or portfolio optimization, in exploration and development activities in order to realize continued reserve and sales growth. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-outlook, for discussion of our $5.2 billion capital, investment and exploration budget for 2013 . the above discussion of strategy and results includes forward-looking statements with respect to the goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion of non-core assets between 2011 and 2013 and expected investment in exploration and development activities. some factors that could potentially affect the divestiture of non-core assets and expected investment in exploration and development activities include changes in prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, actions of competitors, occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and natural gas properties, future financial condition, operating results, economic and/or regulatory factors affecting our businesses, the identification of buyers for non-core assets and the negotiation of acceptable prices and other terms, as well as other customary closing conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 4 the map below illustrates the locations of our worldwide operations. segment and geographic information for operating segment and geographic financial information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production segment in the discussion that follows regarding our e&amp;p operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the u.s., angola, canada, ethiopia, e.g., gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya, norway, poland, and the u.k. liquids-rich shale plays eagle ford - as of december 31, 2012 we have 230,000 net acres in the core of the eagle ford shale, with an additional 100,000 non-core acres. in the fourth quarter of 2011, we made our most significant investment in the eagle ford shale play of south texas when we closed several acquisitions for a total cash consideration of $4.5 billion. throughout 2012, we rationalized our position with several acquisitions totaling $1 billion and select divestitures of acreage located outside the core of the eagle ford shale. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these acquisitions. 5 as of december 31, 2012 , we had 379 gross (262 net) producing wells in the eagle ford shale. we realized significant efficiencies in drilling during 2012, reducing the average drilling time per well to 23 days, reaching td on 248 gross (178 net)operated wells and brought 215 gross (154 net) operated wells to sales. approximately one-third of our 2013 capital budget is dedicated to the eagle ford shale. our plans include drilling and completing 275 - 320 gross (215 - 250 net) operated wells in 2013. we have undertaken a number of pilot tests across the acreage to assist in identifying appropriate spacing, landing zones and completion techniques for the eagle ford. results from vertical landing zone pilots and completions pilots are ongoing and incorporated into operations continuously. initial analysis of spacing pilot results are expected by the end of 2013 and may result in improvements to our overall development plans for the field. eagle ford average net sales for 2012 were 34 mboed, composed of 23 mbbld of crude oil, 5 mbbld of ngls and 37 mmcfd of natural gas. our 2012 exit rate of production was over 65 mboed, which is fourfold increase over december 2011. we are able to transport approximately 60 percent of our eagle ford production by pipeline and additional contract negotiations and facility designs are underway. we continue to build infrastructure to support our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production growth across the operating area. approximately 370 miles of gathering lines were installed in 2012, and 12 new central gathering and treating facilities were commissioned, with 7 additional facilities in various stages of planning or construction. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes, atascosa, and bee counties of south texas. bakken we hold approximately 410,000 net acres in the bakken shale oil play in north dakota and eastern montana. throughout 2012, we continued selective acreage acquisitions and leasing, further expanding a new prospect area. we moved from 20-stage to 30-stage hydraulic fracturing in 2011 to increase both production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from our bakken shale wells. we also continued to alter completion techniques seeking continuous improvement in well performance. we reached td on 88 gross (76 net) operated wells and brought to sales 98 gross (84 net) operated wells in 2012. our bakken shale program includes plans to drill 190 - 220 gross (65 - 70 net) wells in 2013, of which 60 - 70 net wells will be operated by us. our net sales from the bakken shale averaged 29 mboed, composed of 27 mbbld of crude oil, 1 mbbld ngls and 8 mmcfd natural gas in 2012, a 70 percent increase on a barrel of oil equivalent basis over 2011. our production exit rate for 2012 was approximately 35 mboed. we sell our bakken production into various markets via truck, railcar and other marketing options. we have, and continue to secure, long-term agreements to transport portions of our current and forecasted liquid hydrocarbon production to market via third-party gathering systems. oklahoma resource basins in the anadarko woodford shale play in oklahoma, we hold 163,000 net acres of which approximately 100,000 net acres are held by production. in 2012, we executed an operated drilling program focused on the liquids-rich areas of the play, reached td on 25 gross (20 net) operated wells and brought to sales 29 gross (25 net) operated wells. in 2013, we plan to drill 42 - 50 gross (15 - 19 net) wells, of which 12 - 14 net wells will be operated. the anadarko woodford shale averaged net sales of 8 mboed, composed of 1 mbbld of crude oil, 2 mbbld of ngls and 29 mmcfd of natural gas, during 2012, a more than threefold increase over 2011 on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. our 2012 exit rate of production was 10 mboed. other areas of potential growth exist in oklahoma and we are currently evaluating opportunities on legacy assets where the acreage is held by production. future activity in the oklahoma resource basins will be dependent upon the recovery of natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. see below for additional discussion of our conventional, primarily natural gas, production operations in oklahoma. united states alaska in april 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our assets in alaska in a transaction valued at $375 million before closing adjustments. those assets include operated and non-operated interests in 10 natural gas fields in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska and majority ownership in four operated natural gas pipelines totaling 140 miles. the transaction closed in january 2013 for proceeds of $195 million subject to a six-month escrow of $50 million for various indemnities. net sales from alaska averaged 92 mmcfd in 2012. colorado we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in the greater grand valley field complex and 154,000 net acres in the liquids-rich niobrara shale located in the dj basin of northern colorado, southeastern wyoming and nebraska. we drilled 17 gross (12 net) operated wells in the dj basin during 2012. net sales from these two areas averaged 3 mboed in 2012. we have no plans for operated drilling in colorado in 2013. oklahoma we have long-established operated and non-operated conventional production in several oklahoma fields from which 2012 sales averaged 2 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 51 mmcfd of natural gas. in 2012, we participated in 11 gross (1 net), non-operated wells in the state. we also drilled 1 operated well. plans for 2013 include drilling 11 gross (2 net) wells, targeting liquids. 6 texas/north louisiana/new mexico in east texas and north louisiana, we hold 184,000 net acres. approximately 20,000 of the acres are in the haynesville and bossier natural gas shale plays. most of the acreage in these shale plays is held by production. we participated in 5 gross (1 net) non-operated wells in the area during 2012. conventional production was primarily from the mimms creek, pearwood and oletha fields in 2012, with net sales averaging 6 mboed. we also participate in several non-operated permian basin fields in west texas and new mexico. net sales from this area averaged 7 mboed in 2012. we plan continued carbon dioxide flood programs in the seminole and vacuum fields during 2013. wyoming we have ongoing enhanced oil recovery waterflood projects at the mature bighorn basin and wind river basin fields and initiated an additional enhanced oil recovery project at our 100 percent owned and operated pitchfork field in 2012. we have conventional natural gas operations in the greater green river basin and unconventional coal bed natural gas operations in the powder river basin. in 2012, we drilled 2 gross (2 net) operated development wells in wyoming, which included 1 wellbore re-entry. we plan to drill 1 gross (1 net) operated well in 2013. our wyoming net sales averaged 17 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 68 mmcfd of natural gas during 2012. in addition, we own and operate the 420-mile red butte pipeline. this crude oil pipeline connects silvertip station on the montana/wyoming state line to casper, wyoming. over the next two years, we plan to plug and abandon over 600 wells in the powder river basin as we wind down those operations due to poor economics. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for impairments of our powder river basin asset taken in recent years due to declining natural gas prices and reduced development plans. gulf of mexico production on december 31, 2012 , we held material interests in 7 producing fields, 4 of which are company-operated. average net sales for 2012 from the gulf of mexico were 22 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 19 mmcfd of natural gas. we operate and have a 65 percent working interest in the ewing bank block 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform serves as a production hub for the lobster, oyster and arnold fields on ewing bank blocks 873, 917 and 963. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. in 2012, seismic data that was acquired in 2011 on blocks 873 and 917 was processed in order to refine existing opportunities and to identify others for a development drilling campaign that is planned to start in 2015. we own a 50 percent working interest in the non-operated petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830 located 130 miles southeast of new orleans, which includes 14 producing wells. the petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. during 2012, we acquired 4-d seismic data in order to identify potential future drilling opportunities. we hold a 30 percent working interest in the non-operated neptune field located on atwater valley block 575, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the development includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. a well that had been producing from a deeper horizon was recompleted to the main producing zone in 2012. the droshky and ozona developments off the coast of louisiana are both expected to reach abandonment pressures in the first half of 2013. we have a 100 percent operated working interest in the droshky development located on green canyon block 244 and a 68 percent operated working interest in ozona which is located on garden banks block 515. in february 2013, we sold our 34 percent non-operated interest in the neptune gas plant that is located onshore louisiana. the transaction value, before closing adjustments, was $170 million. gulf of mexico exploration we have a portfolio of over 18 prospects with multiple drilling opportunities in the gulf of mexico. as we evaluate these opportunities for drilling, we plan to seek partners to reduce our exploration risk on individual projects. a successful deepwater oil discovery well was drilled on the gunflint prospect, located on mississippi canyon block 948, in 2008. we own a 15 percent non-operated working interest in this prospect. one appraisal well was drilled in 2012 confirming expected reservoir properties and establishing the commercial viability of the field. an additional appraisal well began drilling in february 2013. development planning is ongoing. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater oil discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 10 percent interest in this non-operated prospect. the first appraisal well began drilling in june 2012, has reached td and is currently being evaluated. 7 in the third quarter of 2012, we resumed drilling an exploratory well on the innsbruck prospect located on mississippi canyon block 993 which had been temporarily suspended under the federal government's drilling moratorium. upon reaching td in november 2012, the well was determined to be dry. the well costs and related unproved property costs were charged to exploration expense in 2012. we have a 45 percent operated working interest in innsbruck. we hold a 30 percent non-operated working interest in green canyon blocks 403 and 404 in the kilchurn prospect. the operator commenced drilling in the kilchurn prospect in december 2011. in the second quarter of 2012, the well was determined to be dry. the well costs and related unproved property costs were charged to exploration expense in 2012. in october 2011, we received approval of an exploration plan from the boemre for the key largo prospect located on walker ridge block 578. we have a 60 percent working interest and are the operator of this prospect. drilling is expected in 2014. we currently hold a 100 percent operated working interest in the madagascar prospect located on desoto canyon block 757. our exploration plan was approved by the boemre in 2012. we expect to drill the first exploration well on the prospect in 2013 at a lower working interest. africa equatorial guinea - we own a 63 percent operated working interest under a psc in the alba field which is offshore e.g. during 2012, e.g. net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 36 mbbld, and net natural gas sales averaged 428 mmcfd. operational availability for 2012 averaged 95 percent. we hold a 63 percent operated working interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and an 80 percent operated working interest in the corona well on block d. we plan to develop block d through a unitization with the alba field, which is expected in late 2013 or early 2014. we have an 80 percent operated working interest in exploratory block a-12 offshore bioko island, located immediately west of our operated alba field. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant. under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the dry natural gas in its operations. during 2012, the gross quantity of natural gas supplied to the lpg production facility was 863 mmcfd, and 7 mbbld of secondary condensate and 20 mbbld of lpg were produced by alba plant llc. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. as part of our ig segment, we own 45 percent of ampco and 60 percent of egholdings, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed by alba plant llc, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in e.g., we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our ig segment as discussed below. during 2012, the gross quantities of dry natural gas supplied to the methanol plant to the lng production facility were 119 mmcfd and 639 mmcfd. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba field for later production. libya - we hold a 16 percent working interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin of eastern libya. during the first quarter of 2011, all production operations in libya were suspended due to civil unrest. in the fourth quarter of 2011, limited production resumed from the waha concessions, but we made no deliveries of hydrocarbons. sales resumed in the first quarter of 2012 and averaged 45 mboed in 2012. angola offshore angola, we hold 10 percent working interests in blocks 31 and 32, both of which are non-operated. the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent several potential development hubs. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with the first deepwater development project, called the psvm development, which includes the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well in the northeastern portion of block 31. the psvm development utilizes a fpso with a total of 48 production and injection wells. development drilling began in 2010 and first production was in the fourth quarter of 2012, with first sales in february 2013. our plans include continued development drilling with tie-in to the fpso in order to reach a production plateau of 14 net mboed in the first half of 2014 which is expected to last through 2017. 8 front-end engineering and design for the kaombo development, located in the southeastern portion of block 32, is underway. the development is expected to consist of two-105 mbbld fpso. project sanction is expected mid-2013 so that production from the kaombo development is possible in 2016. we continue to assess other discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 for development potential. gabon - we hold a 21 percent non-operated working interest in the diaba license g4-223 and its related permit offshore gabon, which covers 2.2 million gross (467,500 net) acres. the start of exploration drilling is expected in the first quarter of 2013. kenya - we hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in block 9 and a 15 percent non-operated working interest in block 12a which are located in northwest kenya, covering 12.3 million gross (4.4 million net) acres. seismic has been acquired on block 9 and seismic acquisition on block 12a is underway. the first exploratory well is expected to begin drilling on block 9 in the second quarter of 2013. we have the right to assume the role of operator on block 9 if a commercial discovery is made. ethiopia - in january 2013, government approval was received for our acquisition of a 20 percent non-operated interest in the onshore south omo concession in ethiopia. the concession has an area of approximately 7.3 million gross (1.5 million net) acres. the sabisa 1 exploration well began drilling in january 2013 and is expected to take approximately 60 days to reach the planned td of 8,500 ft. europe norway at the end of 2012, we operated 10 licenses and held interests in six non-operated licenses, which encompass approximately 240,000 net acres on the offshore norwegian continental shelf. in 2012, net sales from norway averaged 81 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 53 mmcfd of natural gas. the alvheim development is comprised of the kameleon, east kameleon and kneler fields (pl 036c, pl 088bs and pl 203), in each of which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. it is produced to the alvheim complex which consists of a fpso with subsea infrastructure. in 2011 and 2012, due to debottlenecking efforts, capacity of the fpso increased by 15 mbbld gross. peak oil production of 157 mbbld gross (94 mbbld net) was reached in the first quarter of 2012. during 2012 operational availability of the alvheim development was 96 percent including planned maintenance activities, while unplanned downtime was minimal at 3 percent. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the sage system by pipeline. at the end of 2012, the alvheim development included 14 producing wells and 2 water disposal wells. in october 2012, we took over operatorship of the nearby vilje field (pl 036d), in which we own a 47 percent working interest, which began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. at the end of 2012, 2 wells were producing and an additional development, vilje sor, had been approved. production from vilje sor is estimated to begin near the end of 2013. the volund field (pl 150 and pl 150bs) is tied back to the alvheim complex, which is five miles to the north. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated working interest, consists of three production wells and one water injection well at december 31, 2012. the drilling of an additional development well at volund was completed in the fourth quarter 2012 and first production commenced in january 2013. the viper/kobra (pl 203) oil discovery, in the immediate vicinity of the volund field, was announced in november 2009. we hold a 65 percent operated working interest in viper/kobra. along with our partners, we are evaluating a possible tie-back to the alvheim complex. the boyla field, formerly the marihone discovery, (pl 340) is located approximately 17 miles south of alvheim. in october 2012, the norwegian ministry of petroleum and energy approved the plan for the development and operation of the boyla field in which we hold a 65 percent operated working interest. first production from boyla is expected in the fourth quarter of 2014. near boyla is the caterpillar discovery (pl340bs), which was made in 2011. it is being evaluated as a tie-back to the alvheim complex through boyla. also offshore norway, the darwin (formerly velsemoy) well is expected to begin drilling late in the first quarter of 2013 on pl 531 in which we hold a 10 percent non-operated working interest. drilling is also expected to commence in the third quarter of 2013 on the sverdrup well on pl 330 where we hold a 30 percent non-operated working interest. in january 2013, we were awarded a 20 percent non-operated working interest in pl 694, which consists of three blocks, south of the sverdrup prospect area, in the norwegian sea. we were also awarded additional acreage in the north sea, north of the alvheim area in pl 203b. our 65 percent working interest and role as operator are the same as pl 203. in addition, effective january 2013, we withdrew from two licenses (pl505 and pl505b). in 2013, we will operate 9 licenses and have an interest in approximately 225,000 net acres. united kingdom net sales from the u.k. averaged 16 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 48 mmcfd of natural gas in 2012. our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent 9 working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 39 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae alpha platform and facilities host the south, central and west brae fields. the north brae and east brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the brae bravo, and the east brae platform, respectively. the east brae platform also hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. two development wells were completed at west brae in early 2011 and we continue to pursue brae complex projects designed to maximize natural gas recovery and maintain deliverability rates to the u.k. market. the strategic location of the brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of twenty-five third-party fields are contracted to use the brae system and 67 mboed are being processed or transported through the brae infrastructure. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the non-operated sage system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. in the u.k. atlantic margin west of the shetland islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the non-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, a 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and a 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the export of foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from the fpso to market. all natural gas sales are to the non-operated magnus platform for use as injection gas. an ongoing upgrade of equipment on the fpso is expected to extend the life of the fields from 2017 to 2021. additionally, the planned installation of replacement flowlines should secure the long-term integrity of the subsea infrastructure. poland as of december 31, 2012, we hold a 51 percent working interest in 9 concessions, an 85 percent working interest in one concession and a 100 percent interest in one concession for a total of approximately 1.2 million net acres. we are operator under all licenses. in 2012, we reached td on 5 gross (3 net) operated wells and in 2013 have reached td on one more gross (0.85 net) well. since late 2011, we have conducted a continuous drill, core and diagnostic fluid injection test program ("dfit"). following these dfit evaluations, we plan to hydraulically fracture select wells. we are evaluating all data collected through drilling in addition to proprietary 2-d seismic acquired in 2011, 2012, and 2013. canada we hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in alberta, canada, which would be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. these leases cover approximately 143,000 gross acres (52,000 net) in four project areas: namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest; birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest; ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest and saleski in which we hold a 33 percent non-operated interest. during the first quarter of 2012, we submitted a regulatory application for a proposed 12 mbbld steam assisted gravity drainage ("sagd") project at birchwood. pending regulatory approval, project sanction is expected in 2014, with first oil projected in 2017. exploration activities leading up to this application included drilling approximately 100 stratigraphic test wells in the winter of 2010 to 2011 and a 3-d seismic survey in 2012. other international kurdistan region of iraq - in aggregate, we have access to approximately 215,000 net acres in the kurdistan region of iraq. we have interests in two non-operated blocks located north-northwest of erbil: atrush, in which our working interest is 20 percent, and sarsang, in which our working interest is 25 percent. through december 31, 2012, discoveries have been made in each block and successful appraisal wells were drilled and tested on both blocks during 2012, including the discovery of additional hydrocarbon-bearing zones. further appraisal and development drilling is planned for 2013. additional exploration drilling is proceeding on the sarsang block. two exploration wells commenced in late 2012 with results expected in the first quarter of 2013. a further exploration well will be drilled during 2013. the exploration and appraisal work on the atrush block resulted in a declaration of commerciality being submitted by the operator in november 2012. a field development plan will be submitted for government approval in may 2013. this plan will outline the forward commitments required to develop the field in the most economic way. the multiple prospects on the sarsang block require additional exploration and appraisal work through 2013. we also have pscs for operatorship of the harir and safen blocks located northeast of erbil. after selling down a portion of our interest in the third quarter of 2012 to balance our portfolio, our working interest is 45 percent in each block. we have completed an extensive 2-d seismic program on both blocks. the first exploration well on the harir block commenced drilling in july 2012, reached td in december 2012, was tested and deemed to be dry. we plan to start an exploration well on the safen block and a second exploration well on the harir block in the first half of 2013. 10 acquisitions and dispositions we continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and dispositions, with a previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3 billion of non-core assets over the period of 2011 through 2013. for the two-year period ended december 31, 2012 , we entered into agreements for approximately $1.3 billion in divestitures, of which $785 million were completed. the remaining $545 million in asset sales were completed by february 22, 2013 . see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisitions and note 6 for additional information about the dispositions. acquisitions in the second half of 2012, we closed acquisitions of approximately 25,000 net acres in the core of the eagle ford shale at transaction values totaling approximately $1 billion before closing adjustments. the acquisitions included wells producing 12 net mboed at closing. in october 2012, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the south omo concession onshore ethiopia with an effective date of august 17, 2012. ethiopian government approval was received and this transaction closed in january 2013 for cash consideration of $40 million, before closing adjustments, plus an additional payment of $10 million due upon declaration of a commercial discovery. in july 2012, we entered into an agreement to acquire non-operated positions in two onshore exploration blocks in northwest kenya. upon closing the $32 million transaction in october 2012, we now hold a 50 percent working interest in block 9 and a 15 percent working interest in block 12a. in june 2012, we entered an agreement to acquire a 21 percent non-operated working interest in the diaba license g4-223 and its related permit onshore gabon. the transaction closed in october 2012. during june 2012, we signed a new production sharing contract with the government of e.g. for the exploration of block a-12 offshore bioko island, located immediately west of our operated alba field. we have an 80 percent operated working interest in this block. the contract was ratified by the government in the third quarter of 2012. we also acquired an additional interest in block d, bringing our working interest to 80 percent. dispositions in february 2013, we entered an agreement to convey our interests in the marcellus natural gas shale play to the operator. in december 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell our e&amp;p segment's interest in the neptune gas plant, located onshore louisiana. the transaction, with a value of $170 million before closing adjustments, closed in february 2013. in the third quarter of 2012, we sold approximately 5,800 net undeveloped acres located outside the core of the eagle ford shale for proceeds of $9 million, recording a loss of $18 million. in june 2012, we agreed to sell-down our interests in the harir and safen blocks in the kurdistan region of iraq. the transaction subsequently closed and we received cash proceeds of $140 million before closing adjustments, so that we now have a 45 percent working interest in each of the two blocks. in may 2012, we executed agreements to relinquish our operatorships of, and participating interests in, the bone bay and kumawa exploration licenses in indonesia. government ratification of the agreements was received during the third quarter of 2012, which released us from our obligations and further commitments related to these licenses. in april 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our assets in alaska in a transaction valued at $375 million before closing adjustments. the transaction closed in january 2013 for proceeds of $195 million subject to a six-month escrow of $50 million for various indemnities. in january 2012, we closed on the sale of our interests in several gulf of mexico crude oil pipeline systems for proceeds of $206 million. this includes our equity method interests in poseidon oil pipeline company, l.l.c. and odyssey pipeline l.l.c., as well as certain other oil pipeline interests, including the eugene island pipeline system. a pretax gain of $166 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2012. the above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, expectations for improvements to development plans from the optimization of well spacing in the eagle ford shale play, planned use of carbon dioxide flood programs, the timing of reaching abandonment pressures for the droshky and ozona developments, the expected life extension of the foinaven fields, the timing of project sanction and first oil from the sagd project, and the goal of divesting between $1.5 and $3.0 billion of non-core assets over the period of 2011 through 2013. the projected asset dispositions through 2013 are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. some factors which could possibly affect 11 these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the sagd project may further be affected by board approval, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, and other risks associated with construction projects. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. productive and

case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. in addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or

related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions through what we call supply optimization, which can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. as discussed previously, we currently own and operate gathering systems and other midstream assets in some of our production areas. we are continually evaluating value-added investments in midstream infrastructure or in capacity in third-party systems. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2012, those contracts for fixed and determinable amounts relate primarily to eagle ford liquid hydrocarbon production. a minimum of 54 mbbld is to be delivered at variable pricing through mid-2017 under two contracts. our current production rates and proved reserves related to the eagle ford shale are sufficient to meet these commitments, but the contracts also provide for a monetary shortfall penalty or delivery of third-party volumes. oil sands mining segment we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the aosp's mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines. gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net to our interest) barrels of bitumen per day. the aosp base and expansion 1 scotford upgrader is at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. as of december 31, 2012, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 216,000 gross (43,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. the five year aosp expansion 1 was completed in 2011. the jackpine mine commenced production under a phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010 and began supplying oil sands ore to the base processing facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. the upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2012 were 47 mbbld and net of royalty production was 41 mbbld. phase one of debottlenecking opportunities was approved in 2011 and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013. future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain under review with no formal approvals expected until 2014. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction 14 process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile corridor pipeline. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the upgrader produces synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. in the fourth quarter of 2012, regulatory hearings were completed to consider the aosp jackpine mine expansion project. the regulatory application was submitted in 2007 and describes a potential oil sands mining development project of 100,000 gross bbld and includes additional mining areas, associated processing facilities utilities and infrastructure. a regulatory decision is expected to be published in the second quarter of 2013. the governments of alberta and canada have agreed to partially fund quest ccs for 865 million canadian dollars. financing has begun to be received over a period of 15 years, including development, construction and 10 years of operations. however, the funding is subject to conditions of achieving certain performance objectives. in the third quarter of 2012, the energy and resources conservation board ("ercb"), alberta's primary energy regulator, conditionally approved and the aosp partners made a final investment decision on quest ccs. as announced in october 2012, we have engaged in discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent interest in the aosp. given the uncertainty of such a transaction, potential proceeds have not been included in our previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3 billion between 2011 and 2013. the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with regard to discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent interest in the aosp and the application for the jackpine mine expansion. the potential sale of a portion of our interest in the aosp is subject to successful negotiations and execution of definitive agreements. the jackpine mine expansion could be affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. reserves estimated reserve quantities the following table sets forth estimated quantities of our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . included in our liquid hydrocarbon reserves, are ngls which represent approximately 6 percent of our total proved reserves on an oil equivalent basis. approximately 70 percent of those ngls reserves are associated with our u.s. unconventional liquids-rich plays. reserves are disclosed by continent, by country, if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil-equivalent barrel basis represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent. approximately 70 percent of our proved reserves are located in oecd countries.

reserves from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to drilling programs within our shale plays and eagle ford acquisitions. synthetic crude oil reserves also increased due to revised technical assessment and a change in royalty related to lower prices. the above estimated quantities of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. the above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. preparation of reserve estimates all estimates of reserves are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x. liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group, which includes our director of corporate reserves and her staff of reserve coordinators. liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by qualified reserves estimators ("qre"). qre are engineers or geoscientists with a minimum of a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed marathon oil's qualified reserve estimator training course. reserve coordinators screen all fields with proved reserves of 20 mmboe or greater every year to determine if a field review will be performed. any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by corporate reserves group management. all other proved reserve changes must be approved by a reserve coordinator. our director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and a master of business administration. her 38 years of experience in the industry include 27 with marathon oil. she is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the society of petroleum engineers ("spe") oil and gas reserves committee ("ogrc"), chairing in 2008 and 2009. as a member of the ogrc, she participated in the development of the petroleum resource management system. she chaired the development of the ogrc comments on the sec's proposed modernization of oil and gas reporting and was a member of the american petroleum institute's ad hoc group that provided comments on the same topic. 17 estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by glj petroleum consultants of calgary, canada, third-party consultants. their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the team lead responsible for the estimates of our osm reserves has 34 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. he is a member of spe, having served as regional director from 1998 through 2001. the second team member has 13 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009. both are registered practicing professional engineers in the province of alberta. audits of estimates third-party consultants are engaged to provide independent estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period for the purpose of auditing the in-house reserve estimates. we met this goal for the four-year period ended december 31, 2012 . we established a tolerance level of 10 percent such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants' initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. this resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. in the very limited instances where differences outside the 10 percent tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and our senior management is informed. this process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2012 or 2011. there were no third-party audits performed in 2010. during 2012, netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. ("nsai") prepared a certification of december 31, 2011 reserves for the alba field in e.g. the nsai summary report is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k. members of the nsai team have many years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. the senior technical advisor has a bachelor of science degree in geophysics and over 15 years of experience in the estimation of and evaluation of reserves. the second member has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering and master of business administration along with over 3 years of experience in estimation and evaluation of reserves. both are licensed in the state of texas. ryder scott company ("ryder scott") performed audits of several of our fields in 2012 and 2011. their summary reports on audits performed in 2012 and 2011 are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the team lead for ryder scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott. he has a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering, is a member of spe where he served on the oil and gas reserves committee and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2012 , 571 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, an increase of 176 mmboe from december 31, 2011. the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2012: (mmboe) beginning of year 395 revisions of previous estimates (13 ) improved recovery 2 purchases of reserves in place 56 extensions, discoveries, and other additions 201 transfer to proved developed (70 ) end of year 571 significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2012 include 56 mmboe due to acquisitions in the eagle ford shale. development drilling added 124 mmboe in the eagle ford, 35 mmboe in the bakken and 15 mmboe in the oklahoma resource basins shale play. a gas sharing agreement signed with the libyan government in 2012 added 19 mmboe. additionally, 30 mmboe were transferred from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves in the eagle ford and 14 mmboe in the bakken shale plays due to producing wells. costs incurred in 2012, 2011 and 2010 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $1,995 million $1,107 million and $1,463 million. a total of 27 mmboe was booked as a result of reliable technology. technologies included statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, rate transient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. the statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved undeveloped locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking reserves. 18 projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as behind-pipe zones where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. of the 571 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2012 , 25 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g. that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004. the timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance with this project intended to maintain maximum production levels. performance of this field since the board sanctioned the project has far exceeded expectations. estimates of initial dry gas in place have increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010. production is now expected to experience a natural decline from facility-limited plateau production in 2014, or possibly 2015. during 2012, the project received the approval of the e.g. government, allowing design and planning work to progress towards implementation, with completion expected by mid-2016. proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development, located in the libyan sahara desert, were booked for the first time as proved undeveloped reserves in 2010. this development, which is anticipated to take more than five years to be developed, is being executed by the operator and encompasses a continuous drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region led to an expected project execution of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked. interruptions associated with the civil unrest in 2011 have extended the project duration. there are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years after their original booking. as of december 31, 2012, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2013 through 2017 are projected to be $2,665 million, $2,726 million, $2,955 million, $2,132 million, and $425 million. the timing of future projects and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries, timing and development costs could be different than current estimates. net production sold north

(c) production operations ceased in libya in february 2011, but fixed costs continued to be incurred. production resumed in 2012. integrated gas our ig operations include natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations. also included in the financial results of the ig segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. egholdings has a 3.7 mmta lng production facility on bioko island in e.g. lng from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement ending in 2023. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 3.8 mmt, 4.1 mmt and 3.7 mmt in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . operational availability for this lng production facility was 95 percent including a planned turnaround, while unplanned downtime was minimal at 1.5 percent. the turnaround was completed four days ahead of schedule and 15 percent under budget. in 2012, we continued discussions with the government of e.g. and our partners regarding a potential second lng production train on bioko island. we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ampco owns a methanol plant located on bioko island in e.g. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field. gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1.06 mmt, 1.04 mmt and 0.85 mmt in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . operational availability for this plant was 91 percent in 2012. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. the above discussion of the ig segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility in e.g. factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient reclassification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 20 competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. based upon statistics compiled in the "2012 global upstream performance review" published by ihs herold inc., we rank tenth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2011 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production and osm operations benefit from higher crude oil prices. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, overview market conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations. environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. these laws and regulations include the occupational safety and health act ("osha") with respect to the protection of health and safety of employees, the clean air act ("caa") with respect to air emissions, the federal water pollution control act (also known as the clean water act ("cwa") with respect to water discharges, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the oil pollution act of 1990 ("opa-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the national environmental policy act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the endangered species act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the u.s. emergency planning and community right-to-know act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. in addition, many other states and countries in which where we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters. these laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. based on regulatory trends, particularly with respect to the caa and its implementing regulations, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. 21 air in august 2012, the u.s. epa published final new source performance standards ("nsps") and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants ("neshap") that amended existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities as well as created a new nsps for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities. these rules have been challenged, and negotiations with the u.s. epa over proposed changes to the rules continue. compliance with these new rules will result in an increase in the costs of control equipment and labor and require additional notification, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping for some of our facilities. the u.s. epa was also notified in december 2012 that seven northeastern states intend to sue the u.s. epa for failure to include methane standards in these rules. if successfully challenged, the addition of methane standards could further increase our costs to comply with this rule. in july 2011, the u.s. epa finalized a federal implementation plan under the caa that includes new source review ("nsr") regulations which apply to air emissions sources on tribal lands. this rule became effective on august 30, 2011, and requires the registration and/or pre-construction permitting of most of our facilities on tribal lands in wyoming, oklahoma and north dakota. rather than issue pre-construction permits for our facilities on tribal lands in north dakota, in august of 2012, the u.s. epa finalized an interim final rule under the caa that requires certain control equipment, recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting with respect to these facilities. compliance with this new rule will result in an increase in the costs of control, equipment and labor and will require additional notification, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping for our facilities on tribal lands in north dakota. climate change in 2010, the u.s. epa promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. our first reports made pursuant to this rule were submitted in september 2012. further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated. these requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate. potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state level through permitting and compliance requirements. state level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in addition, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. in the first quarter of 2010, the u.s. epa announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. the u.s. epa has issued an interim report in late 2012, and expects to issue a final report in 2014. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. remediation the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work. the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies. in february 2009, the ercb issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. we believe that we are substantially in compliance with the directive at this time. we could incur additional costs if further new regulations are issued or if we fail to comply in a timely manner. 22 concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. for the year 2012, sales to statoil and to shell oil and its affiliates each accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. for the years 2011 and 2010, transactions with mpc accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. the majority of those transactions occurred while mpc was a wholly-owned subsidiary. in addition, sales of crude oil and natural gas produced in libya to the libyan national oil company accounted for more than 10 percent of our 2010 annual revenues. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 3,367 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2012 . we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees. executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon oil and their ages as of february 1, 2013, are as

item 1a. risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. when considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. a substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are uncertain. 24 lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering estimates. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group. the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. any significant future price change will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this annual report on form 10-k should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. 25 if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering; lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. 26 we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s., canada, and norway, and the european union. our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions. through 2012, domestic legislative and regulatory efforts included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. further, in december 2012 at the doha climate change conference, countries agreed to extend the kyoto protocol to 2020. however, the u.s. senate has not ratified the kyoto protocol, nor is it clear whether the u.s. senate plans to ratify this agreement in the future. if the u.s. does ratify the kyoto protocol in the future or sign a new international agreement, such actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas) associated with any legislation, regulation, or other action by the u.s. epa, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. private party litigation has also been brought against some emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. the potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise. the u.s. epa announced in the first quarter of 2010 its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. the u.s. epa has issued an interim report in late 2012, and expects to issue a final report in 2014. in addition, various state-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new 27 oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 61 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2012 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 52 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2012 were located outside the u.s. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries and in global markets, such as e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq and libya, including: changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. since january 2010, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence, within some countries in the middle east including bahrain, egypt, iraq, libya, syria, tunisia and yemen. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the u.s. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, such as the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 28 our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. computers and telecommunication devices are integrated into our business operations and are used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems which are utilized to transport our production to market. a cyber-attack impacting these computers and telecommunication devices, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cyber-attacks are evolving and unpredictable. these attacks could include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, the unauthorized release of protected information and the corruption or loss of data. the occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a negative impact on our results of operations. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline and midstream capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, railcars and tanker transportation. if any pipelines, railcars or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties 29 which transport crude oil from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our 30 accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 57 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements typically contain words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "plan," "predict," "target," "project," "could," "may," "should," "would" or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this annual report on form 10-k may include, but are not limited to: levels of revenues, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production or sales of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; levels of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; the impact of government legislation and budgetary and tax measures; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local governments and regulatory authorities. 3 part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was incorporated in 2001 and is an international energy company engaged in exploration and production, oil sands mining and integrated gas with operations in the u.s., angola, canada, e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya, norway, poland and the u.k. we are based in houston, texas with our corporate headquarters at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and a telephone number of (713) 629-6600. on june 30, 2011, the spin-off of marathon's downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. marathon stockholders at the close of business on the record date of june 27, 2011 received one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon common stock held. a private letter ruling received in june 2011 from the irs affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in 2011 and 2010, with additional information in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 28 our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. computers and telecommunication devices are integrated into our business operations and are used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems which are utilized to transport our production to market. a cyber-attack impacting these computers and telecommunication devices, or the networks and infrastructure on which

claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to

for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our 30 accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 31 item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. item 2. properties the location and general character of our principal liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties, oil sands mining properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1. business. net liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil sales volumes are set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. we consider proved and, in some cases, probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. assumptions regarding our ability to realize the u.s. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. 54 pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plans and our unfunded u.s. retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. the constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuance within each defined maturity group. of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 3.44 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 4.06 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $52 million and $9 million and would increase annual defined benefit pension expense by $5 million and would not have a significant impact on other postretirement benefit plan expense. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 65 percent equity and high yield bonds and 35 percent other fixed income securities for the u.s. funded pension plans and 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities for the international funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to our historical returns for reasonableness. decreasing the 7.25 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. we employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. we believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seerisk factors 25 risk factors, item 3. legal proceedings, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements typically contain words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "plan," "predict," "target," "project," "could," "may," "should," "would" or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this annual report on form 10-k may include, but are not limited to statements that relate to (or statements that are subject to risks, contingencies or uncertainties that relate to): levels of revenues, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of liquidity and the availability of financing options; budgets or levels of capital, exploration, environmental, construction or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration, construction or maintenance projects; volumes of production or sales of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; levels of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; quantitative or qualitative factors about market risk; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common

governments and regulatory authorities. 3 part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was incorporated in 2001 and is an international energy company engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, production and marketing of products manufactured from natural gas and oil sands mining with operations in the u.s., angola, canada, e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya, norway and the u.k. we are based in houston, texas with our corporate headquarters at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and a telephone number of (713) 629-6600. on june 30, 2011, the spin-off of marathon's downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. marathon stockholders at the close of business on the record date of june 27, 2011 received one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon common stock held. a private letter ruling received in june 2011 from the irs affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the spin-off with additional information in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. strategy and results summary our strategic imperatives are: uncompromising focus on core values to protect our license to operate and drive business performance investment in our people to grow and maintain our capabilities and competencies to ensure shareholders access to the full global opportunity set relentless pursuit of operational and capital efficiency and recognition as the partner / operator of choice acceleration of resource development to optimize value, grow profitable volumes and replace reserves rigorous portfolio management integrated with robust capital allocation quality resource capture through a focused exploration program and opportunistic business development competitive shareholder value through disciplined long-term focus we continue to focus on liquid hydrocarbon reserves and production worldwide, realizing significant increases in our three key unconventional liquids-rich plays in 2013: the eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins. in 2014, approximately 60 percent of our capital, investment and exploration spending budget is allocated to these areas and includes co-development of adjacent formations in parallel with the main horizons. our exploration program includes prospects in e.g., ethiopia, gabon, the gulf of mexico, kenya and the kurdistan region of iraq. we ended 2013 with proved reserves of approximately 2.2 bboe, an 8 percent increase over 2012 . proved reserve replacement was 194 percent, excluding dispositions. during 2013 , our cash additions to property, plant and equipment were $5.0 billion , including those related to discontinued operations, and we made acquisitions of $74 million. we expect continued spending, primarily funded with cash flow from operations or portfolio optimization, in exploration and development activities in order to realize continued reserve and sales volume growth. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - outlook, for discussion of our $5.9 billion capital, investment and exploration spending budget for 2014 . we continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures and have exceeded our previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion of assets over the period of 2011 through 2013, by closing or entering into agreements for approximately $3.5 billion in divestitures, of which $2.1 billion is from the sales of our angola assets. the sale of our interest in angola block 31 closed in february 2014 and the sale of our interest in angola block 32 is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. additionally, in december 2013, we commenced efforts to market our assets in the north sea, both in the u.k. and norway, which would simplify and concentrate our portfolio to higher margin growth opportunities and increase our production growth rate. the above discussion of strategy and results includes forward-looking statements with respect to the sale of our interest in angola block 32, the possible sale of our u.k. and norway assets and projected spending and expected investment in exploration and development activities under the 2014 capital, investment and exploration budget. some factors that could potentially affect the expected investment in exploration and development activities include changes in prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, actions of competitors, occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and natural gas properties, future financial conditions, operating results and economic and/or regulatory factors affecting our businesses. the timing of closing 4 the sale of our interest in angola block 32 is subject to customary closing conditions. the possible sale of our u.k. and norway assets is subject to the identification of one or more buyers, successful negotiations, board approval and execution of definitive agreements. the projected spending under the 2014 capital, investment and exploration spending budget is a good faith estimate, and therefore, subject to change. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. the map below illustrates the locations of our worldwide operations. segment and geographic information for operating segment and geographic financial information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. in the discussion that follows regarding our north america e&amp;p, international e&amp;p and oil sands mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. north america e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the u.s. and canada. unconventional resource plays eagle ford - as of december 31, 2013 , we had approximately 211,000 net acres in the eagle ford in south texas and 655 gross (493 net) operated producing wells in the eagle ford, austin chalk and pearsall formations. with approximately 90 percent pad drilling in 2013, we continued to improve efficiencies and reduce development costs per well. the average spud-to-td time per well decreased to 13 days during the last quarter of the year compared to 15 days in the same period of 2012. we reached td on 299 gross operated wells and brought 307 gross operated wells to sales in 2013. throughout 2013, we evaluated the potential of downspacing to 40-acre and 60-acre spacing with several pilot programs. overall, wells drilled in these programs at closer spacing showed improved completion efficiency which helped offset impacts due to tighter well spacing. continued focus on stimulation design contributed to incremental improvements in well performance across our area of activity. approximately 39 percent of our 2014 capital, investment and exploration budget is dedicated to the eagle ford. our accelerated drilling plans include drilling 250 - 260 net wells (385 - 405 gross, of which we will operate 340 - 355) in 2014 , an increase of almost 20 percent over 2013. 5 eagle ford average net sales for 2013 were 81 mboed, composed of 51 mbbld of crude oil and condensate, 14 mbbld of ngls and 94 mmcfd of natural gas, compared to 34 mboed in 2012 , a 136 percent increase. our 2013 exit rate was over 98 mboed, a 50 percent increase over december 2012 . in 2013 , we were able to transport approximately 70 percent of our eagle ford production by pipeline. we anticipate the volume of oil sold into pipelines will remain high, with the actual volume fluctuating from quarter to quarter as additional infrastructure to service the area is constructed and commensurate commitments for transportation are executed. the ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint. evaluation of the austin chalk and pearsall formations across our eagle ford acreage position in south texas included four austin chalk wells and one well in the pearsall formation in 2013. early austin chalk production results suggest that the mix of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas is similar to eagle ford condensate wells. we plan to drill 5 to 12 additional gross wells in the austin chalk and pearsall formations in 2014. we will continue to evaluate the pearsall formation in 2014. ongoing austin chalk and eagle ford co-development is planned, pending results from our early wells. co-development will leverage the infrastructure investments we have made to support production growth across the eagle ford operating area. approximately 193 miles of gathering lines were installed in 2013 for a total of over 700 miles of operated gathering pipeline in the area. we now have 24 central gathering and treating facilities, with aggregate capacity of over 275 mboed. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 37-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes, atascosa, and bee counties of south texas. bakken we hold approximately 370,000 net acres in the bakken shale oil play in north dakota and eastern montana, where we have been operating since 2006. since inception, we have continuously sought improvement in efficiency and well performance through optimizing completion techniques. our average time to drill a well continued to improve, averaging 15 days spud-to-td in the last quarter of 2013 , compared to 18 days in the same period of 2012 . we have identified additional improvements to the 30-stage hydraulic fracturing designs put in place in 2012, which are expected to further increase both production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from our bakken shale wells beyond the increases that were attained in 2012 and 2013. we reached td on 76 gross operated wells and brought to sales 77 gross operated wells in 2013 . our bakken shale program includes plans to drill 80 - 90 net wells (200 - 220 gross, of which we will operate 75 - 85) in 2014 . in addition, we plan to recomplete 22 - 26 gross wells to the stage design optimized in 2013. our net sales from the bakken shale averaged 39 mboed in 2013 , composed of 35 mbbld of crude oil and condensate, 2 mbbld of ngls and 13 mmcfd of natural gas, a 34 percent increase over 29 mboed in 2012 . our production exit rate for 2013 was approximately 38 mboed. we sell our bakken production primarily into local north dakota markets via truck or pipeline in efforts to optimize price realizations and such production could be transported to other areas of the u.s. by the purchaser. oklahoma resource basins we hold 209,000 net acres in unconventional oklahoma resource basins, namely the anadarko woodford shale (including the scoop), the southern mississippi trend, and the granite wash, of which approximately 147,000 net acres are held by production. we continued to add incremental acres to our scoop position in 2013. in the anadarko woodford shale, we reached td on 10 gross operated wells and brought nine gross operated wells to sales in 2013. an additional four net non-operated woodford wells were brought to sales. we spud three additional operated woodford wells in the scoop near the end of the year. we drilled two gross operated wells in the southern mississippi trend and brought both wells to sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. we also participated in two gross non-operated southern mississippi trend wells in 2013. lastly, we spud our first operated well in the unconventional granite wash play near the end of 2013. sales from our oklahoma resource basin plays in 2013 were primarily from the anadarko woodford shale and averaged 14 mboed, composed of 2 mbbld of crude oil and condensate, 4 mbbld of ngls and 48 mmcfd of natural gas, for an increase of 68 percent over 2012 net sales of 8 mboed. our accelerated drilling plans for the oklahoma resource basins include drilling and completing 14 - 20 net (21 - 27 gross) operated wells in 2014 , approximately double our 2013 program. approximately six net non-operated wells are also expected to be completed. see below for discussion of our conventional, primarily natural gas, production operations in oklahoma. other united states gulf of mexico production on december 31, 2013 , we held significant interests in 11 producing fields, 4 of which are company-operated. average net sales for 2013 from the gulf of mexico were 17 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 14 mmcfd of natural gas. operational availability for our operated properties was strong at 97 percent, with internal unplanned losses of three percent. we have a 65 percent operated working interest in the ewing bank block 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform serves as a production hub for the lobster, oyster and arnold fields on ewing bank blocks 873, 917 and 963. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. 6 we have a 100 percent operated working interest in the droshky development located on green canyon block 244 and a 68 percent operated working interest in ozona which is located on garden banks block 515. the ozona development ceased production in the first quarter of 2013 and is scheduled for abandonment in 2014. we have a 50 percent working interest in the non-operated petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830, located 130 miles southeast of new orleans, which includes 14 producing wells. the petronius platform is also capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. a well side track project was successfully completed in 2013 and a similar project is planned for 2014. we hold a 30 percent working interest in the non-operated neptune field located on atwater valley block 575, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the development includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. a well side track project is planned for 2014. we have an 18 percent working interest in the non-operated gunflint field development located on mississippi canyon blocks 948, 949, 992(n/2) and 993(n/2). the discovery well was drilled in 2008 and encountered pay in the middle miocene reservoirs. two subsequent appraisal wells were drilled and evaluated in 2012 and 2013. first oil from this subsea tie-back development project is expected in 2016. gulf of mexico exploration we have a portfolio of over 17 prospects with multiple drilling opportunities in the gulf of mexico. as we evaluate these opportunities for drilling, we plan to seek partners to reduce our exploration risk on individual projects. we have a 60 percent operated working interest in the key largo prospect located on walker ridge block 578. the key largo prospect will be the first well drilled with a new ultra deep-water drillship for which we and another operator have recently secured a three-year contract. drilling is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2014. prior to commencing drilling in september 2013, we reduced our working interest in the madagascar prospect, located on de soto canyon block 757, from 100 percent to 40 percent as a result of two farm-outs, which included drilling cost carries. our operated exploration well on the madagascar prospect did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and the well costs and related unproved property were charged to exploration expense in 2013. a deepwater oil discovery on the shenandoah prospect, located on walker ridge block 52, was drilled in 2009. we own a 10 percent non-operated working interest in this prospect. the first appraisal well on the shenandoah prospect reached total depth in 2013. this appraisal well encountered more than 1,000 net feet of oil pay in multiple high-quality lower tertiary-aged reservoirs. additional appraisal drilling is anticipated to begin in 2014. in 2013, we were awarded 100 percent working interest leases in two gulf of mexico blocks: keathley canyon block 153, an extension to the meteor prospect on our existing keathley canyon block 196 lease, and keathley canyon block 340 on the colonial prospect. both of these blocks are inboard-paleogene prospects. colorado we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in the greater grand valley field complex, and held 154,000 net acres in the niobrara shale located in the dj basin that were sold in june 2013. net sales from colorado averaged 2 mboed in 2013 . we have no plans for operated drilling in colorado in 2014 . oklahoma we have long-established operated and non-operated conventional production in several oklahoma fields from which 2013 sales averaged 1 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 43 mmcfd of natural gas. in 2013 , we participated in seven gross non-operated wells in the state. texas/north louisiana/new mexico we hold 268,000 net acres in these areas of which approximately 20,000 of the acres are in the haynesville and bossier natural gas shale plays. most of the acreage in these shale plays is held by production. we participated in three gross non-operated wells in the haynesville shale play during 2013 . conventional production was primarily from the mimms creek, pearwood and oletha fields in 2013 , with net sales averaging 5 mboed. we also participate in several non-operated permian basin fields in west texas and new mexico. net sales from this area averaged 7 mboed in 2013 . we plan continued carbon dioxide flood programs in the seminole and vacuum fields during 2014 . wyoming we have ongoing enhanced oil recovery waterflood projects at the mature bighorn basin and wind river basin fields and at our 100 percent owned and operated pitchfork field. we have conventional natural gas operations in the greater green river basin and unconventional coal bed natural gas operations in the powder river basin. as of december 31, 2013, we had plugged and abandoned 376 of the total 600 wells in the powder river basin and expect production to cease in march 2014 as we wind down those operations. our wyoming net sales averaged 16 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 48 mmcfd of natural gas during 2013 . we drilled 2 gross operated development wells in wyoming in 2013 and plan to drill 10 gross operated wells in 2014 . in addition, we own 7 and operate the 420-mile red butte pipeline. this crude oil pipeline connects silvertip station on the montana/wyoming state line to casper, wyoming. canada we hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in alberta, canada, which would be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. these leases cover approximately 142,000 gross ( 54,000 net) acres in four project areas: namur, in which we hold a 70 percent operated interest; birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest; ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest; and saleski in which we hold a 33 percent non-operated interest. during the first quarter of 2012, we submitted a regulatory application relating to our canada in-situ assets at birchwood, for a proposed 12 mbbld steam assisted gravity drainage ("sagd") demonstration project. we expect to receive regulatory approval for this project by the end of 2014. upon receiving this approval, we will further evaluate our development plans. acquisitions and dispositions in july 2013, we acquired 4,800 net undeveloped acres in the core of the eagle ford shale in a transaction valued at $97 million, including carried interest of $23 million. in june 2013, we closed the sale of our interests in the dj basin for proceeds of $19 million. a pretax loss of $114 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2013. in february 2013, we closed the sale of our interest in the neptune gas plant, located onshore louisiana, for proceeds of $166 million. a $98 million pretax gain was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. in february 2013, we conveyed our interests in the marcellus natural gas shale play to the operator. a $43 million pretax loss on this transaction was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. in january 2013, we closed the sale of our remaining assets in alaska, for proceeds of $195 million. a pretax gain of $55 million was recorded in 2013. the above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to accelerated rig and drilling activity in the eagle ford, bakken, and oklahoma resource basins, possible increased recoverable resources from improvements to the 30-stage hydraulic fracturing designs in the bakken resource play, infrastructure improvements in the eagle ford resource play, potential development plans for the austin chalk and pearsall formations in the eagle ford resource play and for the petronius and neptune fields in the gulf of mexico, anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, projected spending under the 2014 capital, investment and exploration spending budget, planned use of carbon dioxide flood programs, the abandonment of the powder river basin in wyoming, the abandonment of the ozona development in the gulf of mexico, the timing of first oil from the gunflint development in the gulf of mexico, and the timing of project sanction for the the sagd project. the average times to drill a well may not be indicative of future drilling times. current production rates may not be indicative of future production rates. some factors which could possibly affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, availability of materials and labor, other risks associated with construction projects, the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the projected spending under the 2014 capital, investment and exploration spending budget is a good faith estimate, and therefore, subject to change. the sagd project may further be affected by board approval and transportation logistics. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. international e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in angola, e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya, norway, and the u.k. we also include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international e&amp;p segment. africa equatorial guinea production we own a 63 percent operated working interest under a psc in the alba field which is offshore e.g. during 2013 , e.g. net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 34 mbbld and net natural gas sales averaged 442 mmcfd. operational availability from our company-operated facilities continues to be excellent and averaged 99 percent in 2013 , with internal unplanned losses of one percent. a compression project designed to maintain the production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to six years is underway and is expected to be operational in mid-2016. 8 dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed by alba plant llc, as discussed below, is supplied to ampco and egholdings under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location and limited local demand for natural gas in e.g., we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, egholdings and ampco to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. any dry gas not sold is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba field for later production. equatorial guinea exploration we hold a 63 percent operated working interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and an 80 percent operated working interest in the corona well on block d. we plan to develop block d through a unitization with the alba field, which is currently being negotiated. we also have an 80 percent operated working interest in exploratory block a-12 offshore bioko island, located immediately west of our operated alba field. we have secured a rig to drill at least two exploration prospects and one alba field infill well in 2014. equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee, that operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant. under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. during 2013 , the gross quantity of natural gas supplied to the lpg production facility was 866 mmcfd, from which 6 mbbld of secondary condensate and 21 mbbld of lpg were produced by alba plant llc. we also own 60 percent of egholdings and 45 percent of ampco, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates an lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to monetize natural gas reserves from the alba field. egholdings' 3.7 mmta lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement through 2023. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 3.98 mmta in 2013 . operational availability was 97 percent in 2013, including a planned turnaround, while internal unplanned losses were less than one percent. ampco had gross sales totaling 1.01 mmt in 2013 . operational availability for this methanol plant was 90 percent in 2013 and internal unplanned losses were 10 percent. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. libya we hold a 16 percent non-operated working interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin of eastern libya. beginning in the third quarter of 2013, our libya production operations were impacted by third-party labor strikes at the es sider oil terminal. we have had no oil liftings since july 2013. uncertainty around production and sales levels from libya have existed since the first quarter of 2011 when production operations were suspended until the fourth quarter of that year. we and our partners in the waha concessions continue to assess the situation and the condition of our assets in libya. angola during 2013, we entered into agreements to sell our angola assets. see discussion of the transactions in the acquisitions and dispositions section below. gabon we hold a 21.25 percent non-operated working interest in the diaba license g4-223 and its related permit offshore gabon, which covers 2.2 million gross ( 476,000 net) acres. the diaman-1b well reached total depth in the third quarter of 2013, encountering 160-180 net feet of hydrocarbon pay in the deepwater pre-salt play. preliminary analysis suggests that the hydrocarbons are natural gas with condensate content, pending results of ongoing analysis of well data. multiple additional pre-salt prospects have been identified on this license. in late october 2013, we were the high bidder as operator of two deepwater blocks in the pre-salt play offshore gabon. one of the blocks has since been withdrawn by the government. award of the other block is subject to government approval and negotiation of an exploration and production sharing contract. kenya we hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in block 9, consisting of 3.9 million gross ( 1.9 million net) acres in northwest kenya. the first exploratory well on block 9, the bahasi-1, completed drilling in the fourth quarter of 2013 and was plugged and abandoned. the sala-1 exploration well is expected to spud in february 2014 on the eastern side of block 9, where previous wells drilled in the sub-basin confirmed a working petroleum system. we have the right to assume the role of operator on block 9 if a commercial discovery is made. we also hold a 15 percent non-operated working interest in block 12a, covering 5 million gross ( 750,000 net) acres, which is also located in northwest kenya. seismic acquisition on block 12a began in 2013 and will be completed in the first quarter of 2014. 9 ethiopia we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest in the onshore south omo block in ethiopia. the concession has an area of approximately 5.4 million gross (1.1 million net) acres. the sabisa-1 exploration well encountered reservoir quality sands, oil and heavy gas shows and a thick shale section. the presence of oil prone source rocks, reservoir sands and good seals is encouraging for the numerous fault bounded traps identified in the basin. because of mechanical issues, the well was abandoned before a full evaluation could be completed. the tultule-1 exploration well was also drilled in 2013, approximately two miles from the sabisa-1 well in a frontier rift basin and was plugged and abandoned. at least two additional exploration wells are planned for the eastern side of the block in 2014 to test multiple sub-basins. the first of those wells, shimela-1, is expected to spud in march 2014. europe as discussed above, we commenced efforts in december 2013 to market our assets in the north sea, including norway and the u.k. norway production at the end of 2013 , we operated 9 licenses and held interests in 6 non-operated licenses, which encompass approximately 286,000 net acres offshore on the norwegian continental shelf. in 2013 , net sales from norway averaged 71 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 51 mmcfd of natural gas. our production operations in norway are centered around the alvheim complex which consists of an fpso with subsea infrastructure tied to several producing developments. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the sage system by pipeline. production in 2013 continued to benefit from slower than expected decline as a result of infill well success, reservoir management techniques, extended drilling capability and technology application. we safely completed a planned turnaround in nine days in 2013 on time and on budget. operational availability continued to be a strong factor in 2013 performance with a rate of 96 percent and internal unplanned losses of one percent. the alvheim development is comprised of the kameleon, east kameleon and kneler fields (pl 036c, pl 088bs and pl 203), in each of which we have a 65 percent operated working interest, and the boa field, in which we have a 58 percent operated working interest. at the end of 2013 , the alvheim development included 12 producing, 3 temporarily shut-in and 2 water disposal wells. one infill well is planned for 2014 along with several well workovers. the vilje field (pl 036d), in which we own a 47 percent operated working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. vilje has two subsea templates and two production wells, and is tied back through a 12-mile pipeline to the alvheim fpso. a third production well, vilje sor, will be developed as a subsea tieback to the vilje field. production start-up is expected in the first half of 2014. the volund field (pl 150 and pl 150b), located five miles south of the alvheim complex consists of four production wells and one water injection well at december 31, 2013 . we own a 65 percent operated working interest in volund. the viper oil discovery, in the immediate vicinity of the volund field, was announced in november 2009. along with our partners, we are evaluating a possible tie-back to the alvheim complex of the viper discovery as a combined development with the 1997 kobra discovery. both discoveries are within pl203 where we hold a 65 percent operated working interest. norway exploration the boyla field (pl 340), formerly the marihone discovery, is located approximately 17 miles south of the alvheim complex. in october 2012, the norwegian ministry of petroleum and energy approved the plan for the development and operation of the boyla field in which we hold a 65 percent operated working interest. further development drilling is planned in the boyla field in 2014, with first production expected in early 2015. near boyla, the caterpillar discovery (pl 340bs) made in 2011 continues to be evaluated as a tie-back to the alvheim complex through boyla. the darwin (formerly veslemoy) exploration well was drilled in the first quarter of 2013 on pl 531, in which we hold a 10 percent non-operated fully-carried working interest, and was plugged and abandoned. the 30 percent non-operated sverdrup exploration well on pl 330 offshore norway was drilled in the third quarter of 2013 and has been plugged and abandoned. in january 2013, we were awarded a 20 percent non-operated working interest in pl 694, which consists of three blocks, south of the sverdrup prospect area. we were also awarded additional acreage in the north sea, north of the alvheim area in pl 203b. our 65 percent working interest and role as operator are the same as pl 203. in addition, in 2013 we withdrew from three licenses (pl505, pl505bs and pl570). united kingdom net sales from the u.k. averaged 15 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 32 mmcfd of natural gas in 2013 . our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 39 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae alpha platform and facilities host the south, central and west brae fields. the north brae and east brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the brae bravo and the east brae platforms, respectively. the east brae platform also hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. two development wells are in the west brae program, with the first to be spud in 2014. operational availability was 92 percent and internal unplanned losses were eight percent. 10 the strategic location of the brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 30 third-party fields are contracted to use the brae system and 62 mboed are being processed or transported through the brae infrastructure. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage. the working interest owners of the brae area producing assets collectively own a 50 percent interest in the non-operated sage system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. we own working interests in the non-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, a 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and a 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the export of foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from the fpso to market. all natural gas sales are to the non-operated magnus platform for use as injection gas. poland after an extensive evaluation of our exploration activities in poland and unsuccessful attempts to find commercial levels of hydrocarbons, we have elected to conclude operations in the country. during 2013, we relinquished 7 of our 11 operated concessions to the government and are in the process of relinquishing the remainder. other international kurdistan region of iraq in aggregate, we have access to approximately 145,000 net acres in the kurdistan region of iraq. we have interests in two non-operated blocks located north-northwest of erbil: atrush with 15 percent working interest and sarsang with 25 percent working interest. we also have a 45 percent operated working interest in the harir block located northeast of erbil. on the non-operated atrush block, following the successful appraisal program and a declaration of commerciality, a plan for field development was approved by the kurdistan ministry of natural resources in september 2013. the development project will consist of drilling three production wells and constructing a central processing facility. we expect first production by early 2015 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil. the approval of the field development plan for phase 1 provides for a 25-year production period. subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential phase 2 development could add an additional gross 30 mbbld facility. within the potential phase 2 development area, the atrush-3 appraisal well, located approximately four miles east of existing wells, confirmed the extension of the oil bearing reservoirs and has been suspended as a potential future producer. testing has commenced on the atrush-4 development well, spud in october 2013, with anticipated completion in the first quarter of 2014. the atrush-5 development well is expected to spud in the second quarter of 2014. on the non-operated sarsang block, tests have been completed on the gara well. all zones were water-wet and the well was plugged and abandoned in august 2013. on the mangesh well, five drill stem tests have been completed and further testing is planned. the east swara tika exploration well, which began in july 2013, has been drilled to a depth of 5,300 feet toward a planned total depth of 11,000 feet. this well will test additional resource potential to the northeast of the swara tika discovery. on the operated harir block, we announced the mirawa-1 discovery in october 2013. the mirawa-1 was drilled to a total depth of approximately 14,000 feet and encountered multiple stacked oil and natural gas producing zones with equipment constrained test flow rates of more than 11 mbbld of oil, 72 mmcfd of non-associated natural gas and 1,700 bbld of condensate. we have suspended the well for potential future use as a producing well. the jisik-1 prospect, located nine miles to the northwest of the mirawa-1 discovery, will test a similar structure. drilling on the jisik-1 prospect commenced in december 2013 and is expected to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2014. the mirawa-2 appraisal well is expected to spud in the third quarter of 2014, subject to government approval of the mirawa appraisal plan. acquisitions and dispositions in june and december 2013, we entered into agreements, valued in total at $2.1 billion before closing adjustments, to sell our non-operated 10 percent working interests in the production sharing contracts and joint operating agreements for angola blocks 31 and 32. the sale of our interest in block 31 closed in february 2014 and the sale of our interest in block 32 is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. our angola operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. in october of 2013, we transfered our 45 percent working interest and operatorship in the safen block in the kurdistan region of iraq at a pretax loss of $17 million. in january 2013, government approval was received for our acquisition of a 20 percent non-operated interest in the onshore south omo concession in ethiopia. the above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity in the kurdistan region of iraq, ethiopia, kenya, norway, the u.k., and e.g., the anticipated start-up date of the 11 compression project in e.g., the unitization of block d and the alba field in e.g., the award of one block in gabon, plans to exit poland, the possible sale of our u.k. and norway assets, the timing of first production from the boyla field, the timing of first production from the atrush development, a potential phase 2 development in the atrush block, other potential development projects and the sale of our interest in angola block 32. some factors which could possibly affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the award of the block in gabon is subject to government approval and negotiation of an exploration and production sharing contract. the possible sale of our u.k. and norway assets is subject to the identification of one or more buyers, successful negotiations, board approval and execution of definitive agreements. the timing of closing the sale of our interest in block 32 is subject to customary closing conditions. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 12 productive and drilling wells for our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p segments and discontinued operations combined, the following

can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation. in the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. in addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international pscs or exploration licenses. the following table sets forth, by geographic area,

on this acreage in 2014. oil sands mining segment we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the aosp's mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines. gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net to our interest) barrels of bitumen per day. the aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile corridor pipeline. the aosp's scotford upgrader is at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. as of december 31, 2013 , we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 159,000 gross (32,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2013 were 48 mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 42 mbbld. in december 2013, a jackpine mine expansion project received conditional approval from the canadian government. the project includes additional mining areas, associated processing facilities and infrastructure. the government conditions relate to wildlife, the environment and aboriginal health issues. we will begin evaluating the potential expansion project and government conditions after current debottlenecking activities are complete and reliability improves. the governments of alberta and canada have agreed to partially fund quest ccs for 865 million canadian dollars. in the third quarter of 2012, the energy and resources conservation board ("ercb"), alberta's primary energy regulator at that time, conditionally approved the project and the aosp partners approved proceeding to construct and operate quest ccs. government funding has commenced and will continue to be paid as milestones are achieved during the development, construction and operating phases. failure of the aosp to meet certain timing, performance and operating objectives may result in repaying some of the government funding. construction and commissioning of quest ccs is expected to be completed by late 2015. in may 2013, we announced that we terminated our discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp. 15 the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with regard to the jackpine mine expansion and quest ccs. some factors that could affect the jackpine mine expansion include the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining third-party approvals and permits. the quest ccs is subject to the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining government funds, the availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with these types of projects. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. reserves estimated reserve quantities the following table sets forth estimated quantities of our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . included in our liquid hydrocarbon reserves are ngls which represent approximately 7 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent of our total proved reserves on an oil equivalent barrel basis as of december 2013, 2012 and 2011. approximately 72 percent, 63 percent and 40 percent of those ngl reserves are associated with our u.s. unconventional resource plays as of december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. reserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent. due to the agreements entered in 2013 to sell our angola assets, estimated proved reserves for angola are reported as discontinued operations ("disc ops") for all presented periods. approximately 73 percent of our december 31, 2013 proved reserves are located in oecd countries. north america africa europe december 31, 2013 u.s.

in proved reserves from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to drilling programs in our u.s. unconventional shale plays and better than expected performance in norway. synthetic crude oil reserves also increased due to approval of an improved recovery project and price and cost changes. the above estimated quantities of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. the above estimated quantities of proved synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves 17 at the end of each of the last three years, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. preparation of reserve estimates all estimates of reserves are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x. liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group, which includes our director of corporate reserves and his staff of reserve coordinators. liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by qualified reserves estimators ("qres"). qres are engineers or geoscientists with at least a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed marathon oil's qre training course. reserve coordinators screen all fields with proved reserves of 20 mmboe or greater, every year, to determine if a field review will be performed. any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 1 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by a reserve coordinator. our director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. in his 26 years with marathon oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, most recently managing our osm segment. he is a member of the society of petroleum engineers ("spe") and a former member of the petroleum engineering advisory council for the university of texas at austin. estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by glj petroleum consultants ("glj") of calgary, canada, third-party consultants. their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the team lead responsible for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves has over 35 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. he is a member of spe and served as regional director from 1998 through 2001. the second glj team member has 13 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009. both are registered practicing professional engineers in the province of alberta. audits of estimates third-party consultants are engaged to provide independent estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period for the purpose of auditing and validating our internal reserve estimates. we exceeded this percentage for the four-year period ended december 31, 2013 . we have established a tolerance level of 10 percent such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants' initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both parties re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. this resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. in the very limited instances where differences outside the 10 percent tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and senior management consent is obtained. the audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . during 2013, 2012 and 2011, netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. ("nsai") prepared a certification of the prior year's reserves for the alba field in e.g. the nsai summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k. members of the nsai team have many years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. the senior technical advisor has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences, with over 16 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. the second team member has over 9 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over 4 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. both are registered professional engineers in the state of texas. ryder scott company ("ryder scott") also performed audits of several of our fields in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the team lead for ryder scott has over 22 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott. he is a member of spe, where he served on the oil and gas reserves committee, and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. 18 changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2013 , 627 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, an increase of 56 mmboe from december 31, 2012 . the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2013 : (mmboe) beginning of year 571 revisions of previous estimates 4 improved recovery 7 purchases of reserves in place 16 extensions, discoveries, and other additions 142 dispositions (4 ) transfer to proved developed (109 ) end of year 627 significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2013 included 72 mmboe in the eagle ford and 49 mmboe in the bakken shale plays due to development drilling. transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 57 mmboe in the eagle ford, 18 mmboe in the bakken and 7 mmboe in the oklahoma resource basins due to producing wells. costs incurred in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $2,536 million , $1,995 million and $1,107 million. a total of 59 mmboe was booked as a result of reliable technology. technologies included statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, rate transient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. the statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved undeveloped locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking reserves. projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete, or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. of the 627 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2013 , 24 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g. that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004. the timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance with this project intended to maintain maximum production levels. performance of this field since the board sanctioned the project has far exceeded expectations. estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010. during 2012, the compression project received the approval of the e.g. government, allowing design and planning work to progress towards implementation, with completion expected by mid-2016. the other component of alba proved undeveloped reserves is an infill well approved in 2013 and to be drilled late 2014. proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development, located in the libyan sahara desert, were booked for the first time as proved undeveloped reserves in 2010. this development, which is anticipated to take more than five years to be developed, is being executed by the operator and encompasses a continuous drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region led to an expected project execution of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked. interruptions associated with the civil unrest in 2011 and third-party labor strikes in 2013 have extended the project duration. there are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years after their original booking. as of december 31, 2013 , future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves related to continuing operations for the years 2014 through 2018 are projected to be $2,894 million, $2,567 million, $2,020 million, $1,452 million and $575 million. the timing of future projects and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries, timing and development costs could be different than current estimates. 19 net production sold north america africa europe u.s. canada total e.g. other

(c) production operations ceased in libya in february 2011, resuming in 2012, but ceased again in the third quarter of 2013. fixed costs continue to be incurred in these periods of downtime. marketing and midstream our operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon, synthetic crude oil and natural gas production. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. as discussed previously, we currently own and operate gathering systems and other midstream assets in some of our production areas. we continue to evaluate midstream infrastructure investments in connection with our development plans. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and synthetic crude oil to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2013, those contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to eagle ford and bakken liquid hydrocarbon production and osm synthetic crude oil production. a minimum of 54 mbbld of eagle ford liquid hydrocarbon production is to be delivered through mid-2017 under two contracts. under a 6-year contract ending may 2016, 15 mbbld of bakken liquid hydrocarbon production is to be delivered. under a 3-year contract expected to commence mid-2014, 14 mbbld of synthetic crude oil production is to be delivered. our current production rates and proved reserves are sufficient to meet these commitments. the eagle ford and osm contracts also provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. the bakken contract carries no penalty for shortfalls. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. based upon statistics compiled in the " 2013 global upstream performance review" published by ihs herold inc., we rank ninth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2012 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. our operating results are affected by price changes for liquid hydrocarbons, synthetic crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from oil and gas production and osm operations benefit from higher crude oil prices. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, overview market conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations. environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, 21 safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. these laws and regulations include the occupational safety and health act ("osha") with respect to the protection of the health and safety of employees, the clean air act ("caa") with respect to air emissions, the federal water pollution control act (also known as the clean water act ("cwa")) with respect to water discharges, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the oil pollution act of 1990 ("opa-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the national environmental policy act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the endangered species act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the u.s. emergency planning and community right-to-know act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. in addition, many other states and countries in which we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters. these laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. based on regulatory trends, particularly with respect to the caa and its implementing regulations, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air in august 2012, the u.s. epa published final new source performance standards ("nsps") and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants ("neshap") that amended existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities as well as created a new nsps for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities. these rules, which were updated in august 2013, have been challenged, and negotiations with the u.s. epa over proposed changes to the rules continue. compliance with these new rules will result in an increase in the costs of control equipment and labor and require additional notification, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping for some of our facilities. the u.s. epa was also notified in december 2012 that seven northeastern states intend to sue the u.s. epa for failure to include methane standards in these rules. if successfully challenged, the addition of methane standards could further increase our costs to comply with these rules. in july 2011, the u.s. epa finalized a federal implementation plan under the caa that includes new source review ("nsr") regulations which apply to air emissions sources on tribal lands. this rule became effective on august 30, 2011, and requires the registration and/or pre-construction permitting of most of our facilities on tribal lands in wyoming, oklahoma and north dakota. rather than issuing pre-construction permits for our facilities on tribal lands in north dakota, in august of 2012, the u.s. epa finalized an interim final rule under the caa that requires certain control equipment, recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting with respect to these facilities. compliance with this new rule will result in an increase in the costs of control, equipment and labor and will require additional notification, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping for our facilities on tribal lands in north dakota. the u.s. epa is expected to propose the results of its 5-year review of the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) in 2014, which are expected to encompass a proposal for a lower ozone naaqs. a more stringent ozone naaqs could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with any regulation or other action by the u.s. epa that lowers the ozone 22 naaqs, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. at the end of 2013, the u.s. epa indicated that, in addition to sources already regulated under the current nsps subpart oooo, the u.s. epa is considering petitions from members of the public to address other sources of emissions from oil and gas operations such as pneumatics, equipment leaks, liquids unloading, and associated gas. at this time, it is uncertain how the u.s. epa may address these sources (e.g., additional regulations or voluntary programs), what the scope may be, what emission control levels or technology are being considered or the u.s. epa's timing. although there may be an adverse financial impact associated with any such regulation or other action by the u.s. epa, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. climate change in 2010, the u.s. epa promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated. these requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate. potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state level through permitting and compliance requirements. state level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in addition, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, including subjecting the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act. in the first quarter of 2010, the u.s. epa announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. the u.s. epa issued a progress report in late 2012, and expects to issue a draft report for public comment and peer review in 2014, with a final report expected in 2016. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. remediation the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from open-pit mines, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. the aosp is required to reclaim its tailings ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work. the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies. in february 2009, the ercb issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. we believe that we are substantially in compliance with the directive at this time. we could incur additional costs if further new regulations are issued or if we fail to comply in a timely manner. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. for 2013 , sales to british petroleum and its affiliates accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. for 2012, sales to statoil and to shell oil and its affiliates each accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. for 2011, transactions with mpc accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. the majority of those transactions occurred while mpc was a wholly-owned subsidiary. 23 trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 3,359 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2013 . we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees. executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon oil and their ages as of february 1, 2014 , are as follows: lee m. tillman 52 president and chief executive officer john r. sult 54 executive vice

risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. when considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. a substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are uncertain. lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering estimates. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group. the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. any significant future price change will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things. 25 reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future cash flows from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this annual report on form 10-k should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future cash flows from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; 26 title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s., canada, and norway, and the european union. our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions. through 2013, domestic legislative and regulatory efforts included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. further, in december 2012 at the doha climate change conference, 27 countries agreed to extend the kyoto protocol to 2020. however, the u.s. senate has not ratified the kyoto protocol, nor is it clear whether the u.s. senate plans to ratify this agreement in the future. if the u.s. does ratify the kyoto protocol in the future or signs a new international agreement, such actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas) associated with any legislation, regulation, or other action by the u.s. epa, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. private party litigation has also been brought against some emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. the potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise. the u.s. epa is conducting a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, issued a progress report in late 2012, and expects to issue a draft report for public comment and peer review in 2014, with a final report expected in 2016. in addition, various state-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 55 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2013 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 47 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2013 were located outside the u.s. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries such as e.g., angola, ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq and libya, and in global markets including: changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. since january 2010, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence, within some countries in the middle east including bahrain, egypt, iraq, libya, syria, tunisia and yemen. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. 28 if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the u.s. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in 29 order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large 30 classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 55 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements typically contain words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "plan," "predict," "target," "project," "could," "may," "should," "would" or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this annual report on form 10-k may include, but are not limited to statements that relate to (or statements that are subject to risks, contingencies or uncertainties that relate to): levels of revenues, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of liquidity and the availability of financing options; budgets or levels of capital, exploration, environmental, construction or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration, construction or maintenance projects; volumes of production or sales of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; levels of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; quantitative or qualitative factors about market risk; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; the impact of government legislation and budgetary and tax measures; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local governments and regulatory authorities. 3 part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was incorporated in 2001 and is an international energy company engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, production and marketing of products manufactured from natural gas and oil sands mining with operations in the u.s., angola, canada, e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya, norway and the u.k. we are based in houston, texas with our corporate headquarters at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and a telephone number of (713) 629-6600. on june 30, 2011, the spin-off of marathon's downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. marathon stockholders at the close of business on the record date of june 27, 2011 received one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon common stock held. a private letter ruling received in june 2011 from the irs affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the spin-off with additional information in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in 29 order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large 30 classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 31 item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. item 2. properties the location and general character of our principal liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties, oil sands mining properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1. business. net liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil sales volumes are set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 53 income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. we consider a combination of reserve categories related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. assumptions regarding our ability to realize the u.s. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our u.s. pension plans and our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. the constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of december 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. the hypothetical impacts of a 0.25 percent change in the discount rates of 4.28 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 4.85 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: impact of a 0.25 percent increase in discount rate impact of a 0.25 percent decrease in discount rate (in millions) obligation expense obligation expense u.s. pension plans $ (38 ) $ (4 ) $ 40 $ 4 other u.s. postretirement benefit plans $ (7 ) $ $ 8 $ the asset rate of return assumption for the funded u.s. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55 percent equity and high-yield bonds and 45 percent other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. certain 54 components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to our historical returns for reasonableness. decreasing the 6.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. effective january 1, 2014, the expected long-term rate of return was changed from 7.25 percent to 6.75 percent and this change also did not have a significant impact. compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. we employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. 55 we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. we believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seerisk factors 25 risk factors, item 3. legal proceedings, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a. quantitative and

based in houston, texas, with operations in north america, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters are located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our three reportable operating segments is organized based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers. north america e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in north america; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of north america and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g.; and oil sands mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. we were incorporated in 2001. on june 30, 2011, we completed the spin-off of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. strategy and results summary we have production operations in the u.s., e.g., canada, the u.k. and libya. the focus of our u.s. operations is our three core unconventional resource plays: the eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins. our exploration prospects are in e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq and the u.s, primarily in the gulf of mexico. our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("si 7 "): 1. living our values 2. investing in our people 3. continuous improvement in operational and capital efficiency 4. driving profitable and sustainable growth 5. rigorous portfolio management 6. quality and material resource capture 7. delivering long-term shareholder value in 2014, we continued to focus on liquid hydrocarbon reserves, realizing substantial increases in our three unconventional resource plays, the eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins. in 2014, our u.s. operations added 288 mmboe proved reserves, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 37 percent over the prior year's ending balance. for the total company, we ended 2014 with proved reserves of approximately 2,198 mmboe, compared to 2,171 mmboe at the end of 2013 . excluding proved reserves of 106 mmboe related to our angola and norway discontinued operations, proved reserves related to continuing operations increased from 2,065 mmboe at the end of 2013 to 2,198 mmboe at the end of 2014 for an increase of 6 percent. we continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. in 2014, we executed two strategic dispositions for aggregate cash proceeds of more than $4 billion. we closed the sale of our angola assets in the first quarter and our norway business in the fourth quarter. during 2014, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares for $1 billion. our cash additions to property, plant and equipment related to continuing operations were $5.2 billion , primarily funded with cash flow from operations, with more than 70 percent of that related to our eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins where net sales volumes increased 35 percent year-over-year. 5 see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - outlook, for discussion of our 2015 budget. the map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations. segment and geographic information for operating segment and geographic financial information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. in the following discussion regarding our north america e&amp;p, international e&amp;p and oil sands mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. north america e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the u.s. and canada. unconventional resource plays eagle ford - as of december 31, 2014 , we had approximately 180,000 net acres in the eagle ford in south texas and 954 gross (714 net) operated producing wells, where we have been operating since 2011. during 2014 , we reached total depth on 360 gross operated wells and brought 310 gross operated wells to sales, compared to 299 reaching total depth and 307 brought to sales in 2013 . included with the eagle ford well counts noted above, were 22 gross operated austin chalk wells brought online in 2014 and the first four upper eagle ford wells which were brought online late in the fourth quarter of 2014. our 2014 average spud-to-td time was 13 days compared to 12 days in 2013 . our high-density pad drilling continues to average approximately four wells per pad in 2014 . this higher pad density and the longer laterals being drilled in 2014 contribute to the slightly higher spud-to-td time in 2014 . throughout 2013, we evaluated the potential of downspacing to 40-acre and 60-acre spacing with several pilot programs. wells drilled in these programs at closer spacing showed improved completion efficiency which helped offset impacts due to tighter well spacing. the continued focus on stimulation design has contributed to incremental improvements in well performance across our area of activity. eagle ford net sales in 2014 were 112 mboed, 65 percent crude oil and condensate, 17 percent ngls and 18 percent natural gas, compared to 81 mboed in 2013 , a 38 percent increase. in 2014 , we transported approximately 70 percent of our 6 eagle ford production by pipeline and anticipate this to increase to 90 percent in 2015 as additional pipeline capacity is constructed and completed. the ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint. during 2014, we continued evaluation of the austin chalk formation across our eagle ford acreage position in south texas, delineating 18,000 initial austin chalk acres and bringing online 22 wells. initial austin chalk production results indicate that the mix of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas is similar to eagle ford condensate wells. we plan to drill 56 to 62 additional gross wells in the austin chalk formation in 2015 . co-development of the austin chalk and lower eagle ford will leverage the infrastructure investments we have made to support production growth across the eagle ford operating area. during the fourth quarter of 2014, the first four upper eagle ford wells were brought online and we spud our first four-well pilot with austin chalk, upper eagle ford, and two lower eagle ford wells. we operate approximately 800 miles of gathering pipeline in the eagle ford area. we now have 31 central gathering and treating facilities, with aggregate capacity of more than 460 mboed. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 37-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes, atascosa, and bee counties of south texas. approximately 40 percent of our 2015 budget, $1.4 billion, is allocated to the eagle ford. our drilling plans for 2015 include drilling 141 - 152 net wells (245 - 260 gross, of which we will operate 215 - 225), a decrease of approximately 40 percent over 2014. we anticipate bringing 255 - 275 gross operated wells to sales during 2015. bakken we hold approximately 290,000 net acres in the bakken shale oil play in north dakota and eastern montana, where we have been operating since 2006. since inception, we have continuously sought improvement in efficiency and well performance through optimizing completion techniques. we began high-density spacing pilots in 2014, with each pad comprised of six middle bakken formation and six three forks first bench formation wells per drilling-spacing unit. we continue to execute an enhanced completion design pilot program, including elevated proppant volumes, hybrid slickwater fracs, increased stages and cemented liners, with 42 of the 55 tests online at the end of 2014. our time to drill a well averaged 17 days spud-to-td in 2014 compared to 15 days in 2013 . we reached td on 83 gross operated wells and brought to sales 67 gross operated wells in 2014 compared to 76 reaching total depth and 77 brought to sales in 2013 . we recompleted 35 wells during 2014. our net sales from the bakken shale averaged 51 mboed in 2014 , approximately 88 percent crude oil, 6 percent ngls and 6 percent natural gas, compared to 39 mboed in 2013 , a 31 percent increase. in efforts to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local north dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside the state. approximately 20 percent of our 2015 budget, $760 million, is allocated to the bakken. our 2015 bakken program includes plans to drill 42 - 53 net wells (100 - 120 gross, of which we will operate 38 - 48). we anticipate bringing 68 - 78 gross operated wells to sales during 2015. oklahoma resource basins our primary focus in 2015 will be in the scoop and stack areas. in the scoop area we hold approximately 145,000 net acres with rights to the unconventional woodford, springer, granite wash and other pennsylvanian sands plays. we also hold approximately 100,000 net acres in the stack area with rights to the unconventional woodford, meramec and other mississippian plays. these totals include over 50,000 acres added in the scoop and stack areas in 2014. though not a focus of the 2015 program, we also hold 57,000 net acres in the broader western oklahoma granite wash and other pennsylvanian sands plays. in the scoop and stack areas, we reached total depth on 17 gross operated wells and brought 18 gross operated wells to sales in 2014 compared to 10 reaching total depth and nine brought to sales in 2013 . a total of nine net non-operated unconventional wells were brought to sales in 2014 compared to three in 2013 . sales from our oklahoma resource basins in 2014 were primarily from the anadarko woodford shale and averaged 18 mboed, approximately 16 percent crude oil, 28 percent ngls and 56 percent natural gas, compared to 14 mboed in 2013 , a 29 percent increase. approximately 6 percent of our 2015 budget, $226 million, is allocated to the oklahoma resource basins. our drilling plans for the oklahoma resource basins in 2015 include drilling and completing 17 - 20 net wells (41 - 50 gross of which 16 - 20 are company operated wells). we anticipate bringing 18 - 22 gross operated wells to sales during 2015. see below for discussion of our conventional, primarily natural gas, production operations in oklahoma. 7 other united states gulf of mexico production on december 31, 2014 , we held significant interests in 11 producing fields, four of which are company-operated. average net sales in 2014 from the gulf of mexico were 14 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 16 mmcfd of natural gas, or 17 mboed compared to 19 mboed in 2013 . operational availability for our operated properties was 96 percent, with internal unplanned losses of four percent. we have a 65 percent operated working interest in the ewing bank block 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform serves as a production hub for the lobster, oyster and arnold fields on ewing bank blocks 873, 917 and 963. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. we have a 50 percent non-operated working interest in the petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830, located 130 miles southeast of new orleans, which includes 15 producing wells. the petronius platform is also capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. we hold a 30 percent non-operated working interest in the neptune field located on atwater valley block 575, 120 miles south off the coast of louisiana. the development includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. a new neptune sidetrack well came online late december 2014. we have an 18 percent non-operated working interest in the gunflint field development located on mississippi canyon blocks 948, 949, 992(n/2) and 993(n/2), 90 miles south off the coast of louisiana. the discovery well was drilled in 2008 and encountered pay in the middle miocene reservoirs. two subsequent appraisal wells were drilled and evaluated in 2012 and 2013. the subsea tie-back development project will continue to progress in 2015, with first oil expected in 2016. gulf of mexico exploration w e have a 3-year shared contract on the maersk valiant drillship and plan to utilize the rig to test prospects in the gulf of mexico, including one operated exploration well in 2015. as we evaluate various opportunities for drilling, we may seek partners to further reduce our exploration risk on individual projects. a deepwater oil discovery on the shenandoah prospect, located on walker ridge block 52, was drilled in 2009. we own a 10 percent non-operated working interest in this prospect. the first appraisal well on the shenandoah prospect reached total depth in 2013 and was successful. the second appraisal well was spud in late may 2014 and the well costs incurred through december 31, 2014 were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2014. a third appraisal well is anticipated to spud on walker ridge block 51 in 2015. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we drilled two exploratory wells in the gulf of mexico: one on the key largo prospect, located on walker ridge block 578, in which we have a 60 percent working interest and one on the perseus prospect, located on desoto canyon block, in which we have a 30 percent non-operated working interest. neither well encountered commercial hydrocarbons and the well costs incurred through december 31, 2014 were charged to dry well expense. we have no further plans to explore either prospect. oklahoma we have long-established operated and non-operated conventional production in several oklahoma fields from which sales averaged 8 mboed in 2014 and 9 mboed in 2013 . texas/north louisiana/new mexico we hold approximately 242,000 net acres in these areas of which approximately 20,000 of the acres are in the haynesville and bossier natural gas shale plays. most of the acreage in these shale plays is held by production. we participated in one gross non-operated well in the haynesville shale play during 2014 . conventional production was primarily from the mimms creek, pearwood and haynesville fields in 2014 , with net sales averaging 5 mboed in both 2014 and 2013. we also participate in several non-operated permian basin fields in west texas and new mexico. net sales from this area averaged 7 mboed in 2014 . wyoming we have ongoing enhanced oil recovery waterflood projects at the mature bighorn basin and wind river basin fields and at our 100 percent owned and operated pitchfork field. we have conventional natural gas operations in the greater green river basin. operated production at the powder river basin field ceased in march 2014, and plug and abandonment activities were substantially complete as of december 31, 2014. our wyoming net sales averaged 16 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 11 mmcfd of natural gas, or 18 mboed, during 2014 compared to 22 mboed in 2013 . we drilled 11 gross operated development wells in wyoming in 2014 . in addition, we own and operate the 420-mile red butte pipeline. this crude oil pipeline connects silvertip station on the montana/wyoming state line to casper, wyoming. 8 canada we hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in alberta, canada, which would be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. these leases cover approximately 142,000 gross ( 54,000 net) acres in four project areas: namur, in which we hold a 70 percent operated interest; birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest; ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest; and saleski in which we hold a 33 percent non-operated interest. during 2012, we submitted a regulatory application relating to our canada in-situ assets at birchwood, for a proposed 12 mbbld steam assisted gravity drainage ("sagd") demonstration project. we expect to receive regulatory approval for this project by the end of 2015. upon receiving this approval, we will further evaluate our development plans. north america e&amp;p--acquisitions in an asset acquisition that closed august 2014, we added acreage to our oklahoma resource basins at a cost of approximately $80 million before final settlement adjustments. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we acquired additional acreage in the scoop, at a cost of approximately $60 million before final settlement adjustments. international e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya and the u.k. we include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international e&amp;p segment. africa equatorial guinea production we own a 63 percent operated working interest under a psc in the alba field which is offshore e.g. during 2014 , e.g. net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 31 mbbld and net natural gas sales averaged 439 mmcfd, or 104 mboed, compared to 107 mboed in 2013 . operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 98 percent in 2014 , with internal unplanned losses of one percent. a compression project designed to maintain the production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to eight years is underway and is expected to be operational in 2016. dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed by alba plant llc, as discussed below, is supplied to ampco and egholdings under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location and limited local demand for natural gas in e.g., we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, egholdings and ampco to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. any dry gas not sold is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba field for later production. equatorial guinea exploration we hold a 63 percent operated working interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and an 80 percent operated working interest in the corona well on block d. we plan to develop block d through a unitization with the alba field, which is currently being negotiated. we also have an 80 percent operated working interest in exploratory block a-12 offshore bioko island, located immediately west of our operated alba field. the sodalita west #1 exploratory well was spud during 2014 and reached total depth in february 2015. this well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and well costs incurred through december 31, 2014 were charged to dry well expense in the fourth quarter of 2014. a second exploratory well and one alba field infill well are expected to be drilled in 2015. equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee, that operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant. under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. during 2014 , the gross quantity of natural gas supplied to the lpg production facility was 856 mmcfd, from which 6 mbbld of secondary condensate and 19 mbbld of lpg were produced by alba plant llc. we also own 60 percent of egholdings and 45 percent of ampco, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates an lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to monetize natural gas reserves from the alba field. egholdings' 3.7 mmta lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement through 2023. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 4 mmta in 2014 . operational availability was 98 percent in 2014, including a planned turnaround, while internal unplanned losses were less than one percent. 9 ampco had gross sales totaling 885 mt in 2014 . operational availability for this methanol plant was 90 percent in 2014 , and internal unplanned losses were ten percent. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. libya we hold a 16 percent non-operated working interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the sirte basin of eastern libya. beginning in the third quarter of 2013, our libya operations were impacted by third-party labor strikes at the es sider oil terminal. in early july 2014, libya's national oil corporation rescinded force majeure associated with the third-party labor strikes, and our concession term was extended for slightly more than one year. although we had five liftings during 2014, in december 2014, libya's national oil corporation once again declared force majeure at es sider as disruptions from civil unrest continue. considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels. we and our partners in the waha concessions continue to assess the situation and the condition of our assets in libya. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our libya operations. gabon exploration we hold a 21.25 percent non-operated working interest in the diaba license g4-223 and its related permit offshore gabon, which covers approximately 2.2 million gross (477,000 net) acres. the diaman-1b well reached total depth in the third quarter of 2013, encountering 160-180 net feet of hydrocarbon pay in the deepwater pre-salt play. analysis confirmed dry gas accumulation with minor condensate. multiple additional pre-salt prospects have been identified on this license. in 2014, 3d seismic acquisition was completed in the western part of the block. in august 2014, we signed an exploration and production sharing contract for gabon offshore block g13, which was subsequently re-named tchicuate. the block, which is located in the pre-salt play offshore gabon, encompasses 277,000 acres. the seismic program is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2015, and processing will occur through the remainder of the year. we hold a 100 percent participating interest and operatorship in the block. in the event of development, the republic of gabon will assume a 20 percent financed interest in the contract upon commencement of production. the state holds additional rights to participate in the block in the future as a co-investor. kenya exploration we hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in block 9, consisting of approximately 3.9 million gross (1.9 million net) acres in northwest kenya. the sala-1 exploration well was spud in february 2014 on the eastern side of block 9 and made a natural gas discovery in the second quarter of 2014. the well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 10,000 feet, and analysis indicated three zones of interest over a 3,280-foot gross interval which were subsequently drill-stem tested. the sala-2 appraisal well spud in the third quarter of 2014, but did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons, and the well costs were charged to dry well expense. we hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in block 9 with the option to operate any commercial development. we also hold a 15 percent non-operated working interest in block 12a, covering approximately 3.8 million gross (566,000 net) acres, which is also located in northwest kenya. the acquisition of 2d seismic on block 12a began in 2013 and was completed in 2014. multiple prospects have been identified and the first exploratory well is anticipated to be drilled in late 2015. ethiopia exploration we hold a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the onshore south omo block in ethiopia. the concession has an area of approximately 5.4 million gross (1.1 million net) acres. two wells were drilled on the south omo block in 2014: the shimela-1 well, which reached total depth in may 2014, and the gardim-1 well, which reached total depth in july 2014. neither well encountered commercial hydrocarbons and the well costs were charged to dry well expense during 2014. we have a 50 percent non-operated working interest in the rift basin area block with approximately 10.5 million gross acres. we began 2d seismic acquisition in the first quarter of 2015 in order to develop prospect inventory for a future drilling program. we have the option to operate if a discovery is made. other an outbreak of the ebola virus has existed in certain regions of west africa (guinea, liberia, sierra leone) since late 2013. although neither e.g. nor any other african country in which we have business activities has been impacted by ebola to date, our business operations may be adversely affected through travel or other restrictions. we continue to monitor the situation, have enhanced our emergency response plans to address any potential impact, and are working closely with appropriate external parties to maintain business continuity and the health and well-being of our staff. other international united kingdom net sales from the u.k. averaged 11 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 28 mmcfd of natural gas, or 16 mboed, in 2014 compared to 20 mboed in 2013 . our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 39 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae alpha platform and facilities host the south, central and west brae fields. the north brae and east brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the brae bravo and the east brae platforms, respectively. the east brae platform also hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent 10 working interest. operational availability in 2014 for the brae complex was 90 percent and internal unplanned losses were nine percent. we brought two south brae infill wells online late in the second half of 2014 and plan to complete two west brae subsea wells and one additional south brae infill well in 2015. the strategic location of the brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the brae infrastructure. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage. the working interest owners of the brae area producing assets collectively own a 50 percent non-operated interest in the sage system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. we own non-operated working interests in the foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, a 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and a 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the export of foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an fpso to market. all natural gas sales are to the non-operated magnus platform for use as injection gas. croatia we were awarded, as part of a consortium, seven blocks located offshore in the adriatic sea, subject to negotiation of a psc with the croatian government. we have a 60 percent interest in the consortium. kurdistan region of iraq in aggregate, we have approximately 109,000 net acres in the kurdistan region of iraq. we have a 45 percent operated working interest in the harir block located northeast of erbil. for a short time in 2014, we suspended certain operations due to security concerns in the region and continue to closely monitor the situation. we also have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of erbil: atrush with 15 percent working interest and sarsang with 20 percent working interest. on the non-operated atrush block, following the successful appraisal program and a declaration of commerciality, the kurdistan ministry of natural resources approved a plan for field development in september 2013. the development project consists of drilling three production wells and constructing a central processing facility in phase 1 which provides for a 25-year production period. we expect first production in late 2015 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil. subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential phase 2 development could add an additional gross 30 mbbld facility. the atrush-3 appraisal well, within the potential phase 2 development area approximately four miles east of existing wells, confirmed the extension of the oil bearing reservoirs in 2013 and has been suspended as a potential future producer. on the non-operated sarsang block, the swara tika discovery was declared commercial in may 2014 and a field development plan was filed in june 2014. currently, the east swara tika-1 exploration well is being sidetracked up-dip. discussions are ongoing with the ministry of natural resources to finalize the swara tika field development plan. on the operated harir block, we spud the mirawa-2 appraisal well in december 2014 which is expected to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2015. in december 2014, we announced the jisik-1 discovery and in 2013, the mirawa-1 discovery. both the jisik-1 and mirawa-1 exploratory wells had discovered multiple stacked oil and natural gas producing zones, and have been suspended for potential future use as producing wells. acquisitions and dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2014, we closed the sale of our norway business, including the operated alvheim fpso, 10 operated l icenses and a number of non-operated licenses on the norwegian continental shelf in the north sea, with an effective date of january 1, 2014 for proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion. in the first quarter of 2014, we closed the sales of our 10 percent non-operated working interests in the production sharing contracts and joint operating agreements for angola blocks 31 and 32 for aggregate proceeds of approximately $2 billion. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these dispositions, including discontinued operations presentation. 11 productive and

alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the aosp's mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta, and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines. gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net to our interest) barrels of bitumen per day. the aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile corridor pipeline. the aosp's scotford upgrader is located at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. as of december 31, 2014 , we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 163,000 gross (33,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2014 averaged 50 mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 41 mbbld. in december 2013, a jackpine mine expansion project received conditional approval from the canadian government. the project includes additional mining areas, associated processing facilities and infrastructure. the government conditions relate to wildlife, the environment and aboriginal health issues. we will evaluate the potential expansion project and government conditions after infrastructure reliability initiatives are completed. the governments of alberta and canada have agreed to partially fund quest ccs for $865 million canadian. in the third quarter of 2012, the energy and resources conservation board ("ercb"), alberta's primary energy regulator at that time, conditionally approved the project and the aosp partners approved proceeding to construct and operate quest ccs. government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development, construction and operating phases. failure of the aosp to meet certain timing, performance and operating objectives may result in repaying some of the government funding. construction and commissioning of quest ccs is expected to be completed by late 2015. 14 reserves estimated reserve quantities reserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent. other international ("other int'l"), includes the u.k. and the kurdistan region of iraq. we closed the sale of our angola assets in the first quarter of 2014 and our norway business in the fourth quarter of 2014, and both are shown as discontinued operations ("disc ops") for all periods presented. approximately 76 percent of our proved reserves are located in oecd countries. our december 31, 2014 proved reserves were calculated using the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in 2014 within the 12-month period. the 2014 unweighted averages for certain of the benchmark prices were as follows: wti crude oil - $94.99 per bbl henry hub natural gas - $4.31 per mmbtu brent crude oil - $101.39 per bbl when determining the december 31, 2014 proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted with price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. beginning in the second half of 2014, the crude oil benchmarks began to decline and this decline continued into early 2015. in addition, the henry hub natural gas benchmark began to decline in late 2014 and continued its decline into 2015. commodity prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and could decline further. the january 2015 benchmark closing prices for the first day of the month were wti crude oil of $52.69 per bbl, henry hub natural gas of $2.99 per mmbtu and brent crude oil of $55.55 per bbl. sustained reduced commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and future cash flows of our proved reserves. to the extent that we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices in 2015, there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved. estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing the reserves as of the end of the year. the decline in commodity prices experienced in the second half of 2014 has resulted in a reduction in the costs of developing and producing reserves. the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future cash flows will be partially offset by the impact of lower costs. a sustained period of lower commodity prices could also cause us to decrease our near term capital programs and defer investment until prices improve. a shifting of capital expenditures into future periods outside of five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves. see item 1a. risk factors for a further discussion of how a substantial extended decline in commodity prices could impact us. the most significant increase in total proved reserves from 2013 to 2014 related to our u.s. unconventional shale plays, while sales of reserves in place related to our norway and angola discontinued operations were the largest decreases in 2014 proved reserves. excluding discontinued operations, total proved reserves related to continuing operations increased 133 mmboe primarily due to drilling programs in our u.s. unconventional shale plays and additions in e.g. and the kurdistan region of iraq, offset by production. in the u.s., we added 288 mmboe in 2014, excluding purchases and sales of reserves in place and production, amounting to an increase of 37 percent over the 2013 ending balance, mainly due to downspacing, drilling activity and improved well performance. the negative 55 mmboe revision to canadian synthetic crude oil reserves primarily reflects the impact of technical and price changes on calculated royalty volumes as well as development plan changes in the mineable areas. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities for more information. the following tables set forth estimated quantities of our proved crude oil and condensate, ngl, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of

of regulation s-x. crude oil and condensate, ngl, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group, which includes our director of corporate reserves and his staff of reserve coordinators. crude oil and condensate, ngl, and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by qualified reserves estimators ("qres"). qres are engineers or geoscientists who hold at least a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed marathon oil's qre training course. our corporate reserves group screens all fields with net proved reserves of 20 mmboe or greater, every year, to determine if a field review will be performed. any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 1 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by a reserve coordinator. our director of corporate reserves, who reports to our vice president, operations services, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. in his 27 years with marathon oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including managing our osm segment. he is a member of the society of petroleum engineers ("spe") and a former member of the petroleum engineering advisory council for the university of texas at austin. estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by glj petroleum consultants ("glj") of calgary, canada, third-party consultants. their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the individual responsible for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves has 14 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered practicing professional engineer in the province of alberta. audits of estimates third-party consultants are engaged to provide independent estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period for the purpose of auditing and validating our internal reserve estimates. we exceeded this percentage for the four-year period ended december 31, 2014 . we have established a tolerance level of 10 percent such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants for each field are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants' initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both parties re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate. this resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. in the very limited instances where differences outside the 10 percent tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and senior management consent is obtained. the audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . 17 during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. ("nsai") prepared a certification of the prior year's reserves for the alba field in e.g. the nsai summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k. members of the nsai team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. the senior technical advisor has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences, with over 15 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. the second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with 5 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. both are registered professional engineers in the state of texas. ryder scott company ("ryder scott") also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the team lead for ryder scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott. he is a member of spe, where he served on the oil and gas reserves committee, and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2014 , 728 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, an increase of 101 mmboe from december 31, 2013 . the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2014 : (mmboe) beginning of year 627 revisions of previous estimates 1 improved recovery 1 purchases of reserves in place 4 extensions, discoveries, and other additions 227 dispositions (29 ) transfers to proved developed (103 ) end of year 728 significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2014 included 121 mmboe in the eagle ford and 61 mmboe in the bakken shale plays due to development drilling. transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 67 mmboe in the eagle ford, 26 mmboe in the bakken and 1 mmboe in the oklahoma resource basins due to development drilling and completions. costs incurred in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $3,149 million , $2,536 million and $1,995 million . a total of 102 mmboe was booked as extensions, discoveries or other additions due to the application of reliable technology. technologies included statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. the statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved undeveloped locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete, or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. of the 728 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2014 , 19 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g. that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004. the timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance with this project intended to maintain maximum production levels. performance of this field since the board sanctioned the project has far exceeded expectations. estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010. during 2012, the compression project received the approval of the e.g. government, allowing design and planning work to progress towards implementation, with completion expected by mid-2016. the other component of alba proved undeveloped reserves is an infill well approved in 2013 and to be drilled in the second quarter of 2015. proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development, located in the libyan sahara desert, were booked for the first time in 2010. this development, which is anticipated to take more than five years to develop, is executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region lead to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked. interruptions associated with the civil unrest in 2011 and third-party labor strikes and civil unrest in 2013-2014 have also extended the project duration. as of december 31, 2014 , future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves related to continuing operations for the years 2015 through 2019 are projected to be $2,915 million, $2,598 million, $2,493 million, $2,669 million and $2,745 million. 18 net production sold north america africa u.s. canada total e.g. other total other int'l disc ops total year ended december 31, 2014 crude

information on oil and gas producing activities - results of operations for oil and gas production activities for more information regarding production costs. n.m. not meaningful information due to limited sales in 2014. marketing and midstream our operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon, synthetic crude oil and natural gas production. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. as discussed previously, we currently own and operate gathering systems and other midstream assets in some of our production areas. we continue to evaluate midstream infrastructure investments in connection with our development plans. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and synthetic crude oil to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2014 , those contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to liquid hydrocarbon production in the eagle ford and bakken, and osm synthetic crude oil production. eagle ford liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from a minimum of 76 mbbld increasing to 113 mbbld in 2015 through 2018 and 51 mbbld to 65 mbbld in 2019 through 2020. bakken liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments of 10 mbbld commence in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expire june 1, 2026. synthetic crude oil production sales commitments fall under a 3-year agreement for 13.5 mbbld which expires july 2017. our current production rates, forecasts and proved reserves are sufficient to meet these commitments. all of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. in addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. based upon statistics compiled in the " 2014 global upstream performance review" published by ihs inc., we rank tenth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2013 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. we also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. our operating results are affected by price changes for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from oil and gas production and osm operations benefit from higher liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas prices. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, overview market conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations. 20 environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. these laws and regulations include the occupational safety and health act ("osha") with respect to the protection of the health and safety of employees, the clean air act ("caa") with respect to air emissions, the federal water pollution control act (also known as the clean water act ("cwa")) with respect to water discharges, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the oil pollution act of 1990 ("opa-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the national environmental policy act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the endangered species act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the u.s. emergency planning and community right-to-know act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. in addition, many other states and countries in which we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters. these laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. based on regulatory trends, particularly with respect to the caa and its implementing regulations, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air and climate change the epa proposed a more stringent national ambient air quality standard (naaqs) for ozone in december 2014. a more stringent ozone naaqs could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with any regulation or other action by the epa that lowers the ozone naaqs, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. in august 2012, the epa published final new source performance standards ("nsps") and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants ("neshap") that amended existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities as well as created a new nsps for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of january 1, 2015. while these rules remain in effect, the epa announced in 2013 that it would reexamine and reissue the rules over the next three years. the epa has issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and additional rules are expected. in december 2014, the epa issued finalized additional amendments to these rules that, among other things, distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements. further, in 2012, seven states sued the epa to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and gas sources is appropriate and, if so, to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. in april 2014, the epa released a set of five white papers analyzing methane emissions from the industry, and, based on responses received, announced in early 2015 that it will begin the process of issuing a rule governing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our 21 operations, we could be required to forego construction, modification or certain operations. these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects, including the construction and operation of facilities. in 2010, the epa promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding potential methane regulation by epa). these requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate. potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. state and local level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. further, the bureau of land management is expected to issue a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction in early 2015. in addition, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, including subjecting the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act. in the first quarter of 2010, the epa announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. the epa issued a progress report in late 2012, and expects to issue a draft report for public comment and peer review in 2015, with a final report expected in 2016. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. transportation a number of state and federal rules apply to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons. in 2014, the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) proposed a rule relating to testing and classification of liquid hydrocarbons and imposing additional restrictions on the types of rail cars that may be used in certain types of liquid hydrocarbon service. although our businesses do not own rail cars and purchasers of our liquid hydrocarbons make arrangements for its transportation, such regulations could increase transportation costs which are passed on to marathon oil by liquid hydrocarbon purchasers. we anticipate a final rule sometime in 2015. in addition, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, a sub-agency of dot, has proposed or announced the intention to propose various rules related to pipeline transportation of natural gas and/or liquid hydrocarbons. such regulations could increase the regulatory burden on our businesses where we own or operate pipelines, or could otherwise increase costs to third parties that are passed on to marathon oil. remediation the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from open-pit mines, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. the aosp is required to reclaim its tailings ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work. the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies. in february 2009, the ercb issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. we believe that we are substantially in compliance with the directive at this time. we could incur additional costs if further new regulations are issued or if we fail to comply in a timely manner. 22 water in 2014, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the clean water act and its various programs. if finalized as proposed, this expansion will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping, and recording for some of our facilities. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. for 2014 , sales to shell oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total revenues. for 2013 , sales to statoil, the purchaser of the majority of our libyan crude oil, accounted for approximately 10 percent of our annual revenues. for 2012 , sales to statoil accounted for approximately 15 percent of our total revenues, while sales to shell oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 12 percent of our annual revenues. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 3,330 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2014 . we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees. executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon oil and their ages as of february 1, 2015 , are as follows: lee m. tillman 53 president and chief executive

the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are uncertain. prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices could have adverse effects on our business, including: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, or delay or postpone some of our capital projects, resulting in lower production of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the amounts of our estimated proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves that we may produce economically; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; and limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt and/or increasing the costs of obtaining such capital. 25 a substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, which could negatively impact our financial results. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas transportation, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. in addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. if commodity prices remain at or fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. the inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our financial results. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering estimates. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group. the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. for 2014, the average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period were wti crude oil of $94.99 per bbl, henry hub natural gas of $4.31 per mmbtu and brent crude oil of $101.39 per bbl. any significant future price change could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. the january 2015 benchmark closing prices for the first day of the month were wti crude oil of $52.69 per bbl, henry hub natural gas of $2.99 per mmbtu and brent crude oil of $55.55 per bbl. to the extent that we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices in 2015, there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. 26 the discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this annual report on form 10-k should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; 27 increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions. currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s., canada, and norway, and the european union. internationally, member countries that have ratified the kyoto protocol have made additional commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. the u.s. has not ratified the kyoto protocol, but may do so in the future. the epa has announced its intention to specifically regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. for example, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the epa research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to 28 operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 41 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes related to continuing operations in 2014 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 55 percent of our proved crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2014 were located outside the u.s. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries such as e.g., angola, ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq and libya, and in global markets including: changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. for the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the middle east, including bahrain, egypt, iraq, libya, syria, tunisia and yemen. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the u.s. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. 29 our commodity price risk management may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. 30 many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 31 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 60 quantitative and

based in houston, texas, with operations in north america, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters are located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our three reportable operating segments is organized based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers. north america e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in north america; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of north america and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g.; and oil sands mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. we were incorporated in 2001. on june 30, 2011, we completed the spin-off of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. strategy and results summary we have production operations in the u.s., e.g., canada, the u.k. and libya. the focus of our u.s. operations is our three core unconventional resource plays: the eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins. our exploration prospects are in e.g., ethiopia, gabon, kenya, the kurdistan region of iraq and the u.s, primarily in the gulf of mexico. our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("si 7 "): 1. living our values 2. investing in our people 3. continuous improvement in operational and capital efficiency 4. driving profitable and sustainable growth 5. rigorous portfolio management 6. quality and material resource capture 7. delivering long-term shareholder value in 2014, we continued to focus on liquid hydrocarbon reserves, realizing substantial increases in our three unconventional resource plays, the eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins. in 2014, our u.s. operations added 288 mmboe proved reserves, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 37 percent over the prior year's ending balance. for the total company, we ended 2014 with proved reserves of approximately 2,198 mmboe, compared to 2,171 mmboe at the end of 2013 . excluding proved reserves of 106 mmboe related to our angola and norway discontinued operations, proved reserves related to continuing operations increased from 2,065 mmboe at the end of 2013 to 2,198 mmboe at the end of 2014 for an increase of 6 percent. we continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. in 2014, we executed two strategic dispositions for aggregate cash proceeds of more than $4 billion. we closed the sale of our angola assets in the first quarter and our norway business in the fourth quarter. during 2014, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares for $1 billion. our cash additions to property, plant and equipment related to continuing operations were $5.2 billion , primarily funded with cash flow from operations, with more than 70 percent of that related to our eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins where net sales volumes increased 35 percent year-over-year. 5 see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - outlook, for discussion of our 2015 budget. the map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations. segment and geographic information for operating segment and geographic financial information, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. 30 many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 31 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. item 2. properties the location and general character of our principal liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties, oil sands mining properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1. business. net crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil sales volumes are set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. in the second quarter of 2014, we reviewed our foreign operations, including the disposition of our norway business, and concluded that our foreign operations do not have the same level of immediate capital needs as previously expected. therefore, we no longer intend for previously unremitted foreign earnings associated with our u.k. operations to be permanently reinvested outside the u.s. our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. we consider a combination of reserve categories related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. assumptions regarding our ability to realize the u.s. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our u.s. pension plans and our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. the constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. 59 of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of december 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. the hypothetical impacts of a 0.25 percent change in the discount rates of 3.71 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 4.01 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: impact of a 0.25 percent increase in discount rate impact of a 0.25 percent decrease in discount rate (in millions) obligation expense obligation expense u.s. pension plans $ (35 ) $ (4 ) $ 37 $ 4 other u.s. postretirement benefit plans $ (7 ) $ $ 8 $ the asset rate of return assumption for the funded u.s. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55 percent equity and 45 percent other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. decreasing the 6.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, ngl, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seerisk factors 25 risk factors, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures

oil corporation is an independent global exploration and production company based in houston, texas, with operations in north america, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters are located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our three reportable operating segments is organized based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers. north america e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in north america; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of north america and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g.; and oil sands mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. we were incorporated in 2001. on june 30, 2011, we completed the spin-off of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. strategy and results summary marathon oil's strategy is to safely and sustainably deliver value by investing in low cost, liquids-rich projects with a focus on risk-adjusted rates of return. we are focused in the high quality core of three premier unconventional resource plays in the u.s.: the eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins. our strategy for our operated conventional producing assets in e.g., the u.k. and the u.s. is to maximize value and cash flow to provide flexibility to invest in the shorter cycle opportunities in the u.s. resource plays. our conventional exploration program is currently limited to existing commitments in the gulf of mexico and gabon. our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("si 7 "): 1. living our values 2. investing in our people 3. continuous improvement in operational and capital efficiency 4. driving profitable and sustainable growth 5. rigorous portfolio management 6. quality and material resource capture 7. delivering long-term shareholder value commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into our business. the low pricing environment has presented several challenges for us and our industry. we responded to the lower commodity prices in a number of ways: reduced our 2015 capital program by approximately 50% from the prior year, down to $3 billion established our 2016 capital program at $1.4 billion exercised cost discipline, significantly reducing drilling and completion, production and general and administrative costs drove sustainable operational efficiency gains in the u.s. unconventional resource plays scaled back our conventional exploration program to focus on our u.s. unconventional resources plays increased our target for non-core asset sales, now $750 million to $1 billion, up from our previous goal of $500 million closed over $300 million of non-core asset sales (excluding closing adjustments) protected our liquidity and capital structure: issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes ($1 billion of which was used to repay the 0.90% senior notes that matured in november 2015) increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion while also extending the maturity date an additional year to may 2020 decreased our quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.05 per share, saving approximately $425 million of cash on an annualized basis 5 in 2015, we continued to focus on the u.s. unconventional resource plays. we progressed co-development in the eagle ford, further delineated austin chalk in the eagle ford along with scoop/stack in the oklahoma resource basins and improved overall competitiveness in the bakken with cost reductions and enhanced completions. our u.s. operations added 73 mmboe proved reserves in 2015, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 107% over the prior year's ending balance. net sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 6% to 438 mboed in 2015 from 415 mboed in 2014. volumes from our three u.s. resource plays totaled 218 mboed, an increase of 20% from 181 mboed in 2014. for the total company, we ended 2015 with proved reserves of approximately 2,163 mmboe as compared to 2,198 mmboe at the end of 2014 . see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - outlook, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and outlook, including the 2016 capital program. the map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations. segment and geographic information for operating segment and geographic financial information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. in the following discussion regarding our north america e&amp;p, international e&amp;p and oil sands mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. north america e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the u.s. and canada. our primary focus in the north america e&amp;p segment is concentrated within our unconventional resource plays. the following tables provide additional detail regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operated drilling activity: 6 net sales volumes 2015 increase (decrease) 2014 increase (decrease) 2013 equivalent barrels ( mboed )

77 eagle ford - as of december 31, 2015 , we had approximately 153,000 net acres in the eagle ford in south texas and 1,236 gross (911 net) operated producing wells, where we have been operating since 2011. of the 276 gross wells brought to sales in 2015, 56 were in the austin chalk, 28 were in the upper eagle ford and 192 were in the lower eagle ford. of the 310 gross wells brought to sales in 2014, 22 were in the austin chalk and four were in the upper eagle ford. our 2015 average spud-to-td time was 11 days compared to 13 days in 2014 . our high-density pad drilling continues to average approximately four wells per pad in 2015 . the continued focus on stimulation design has contributed to incremental improvements in well performance across our area of activity. during 2015, we continued evaluation of the austin chalk formation and began delineation of upper eagle ford across our acreage position in south texas, with a total of 22,000 austin chalk acres and 16,500 upper eagle ford acres now delineated. the mix of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas from the austin chalk wells is similar to eagle ford condensate wells. co-development of the austin chalk, upper and lower eagle ford horizons will leverage the infrastructure investments we have made to support production growth across the eagle ford operating area. we operate approximately 800 miles of gathering pipeline in the eagle ford area. we now have 32 central gathering and treating facilities, with aggregate capacity of more than 475 mboed. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes, atascosa and bee counties of south texas. in late 2015 , we connected to a newly constructed third-party liquids pipeline, which allowed us to increase the amount of our eagle ford production transported by pipeline to 90% at year-end, up from an average of 70% during 2014. the ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint. approximately 42% of our 2016 capital program, $600 million, is allocated to the eagle ford. we expect drilling activity to average five rigs in 2016. our drilling plans for 2016 include drilling 91 - 96 net wells (150 - 160 gross, of which we will operate 134 - 141). we anticipate bringing 124 - 132 gross operated wells to sales during 2016. oklahoma resource basins our primary focus in 2016 will be in the scoop and stack areas. in the scoop and stack areas we hold approximately 265,000 net acres with rights to the woodford, springer, meramec, granite wash and 7 other pennsylvanian and mississippian plays. this includes 8,000 net acres added in the oklahoma resource basins, primarily in the stack meramec play during 2015. approximately 90% of our scoop acreage is held by production. in the scoop woodford, we delineated over 70% of our acreage. we estimate the scoop springer has a high oil yield that is about 85% liquids. we believe about 80% of our acreage in stack has the potential for co-development of multiple horizons. about 67,000 stack woodford acres are delineated while approximately 42,000 acres of stack meramec acreage is delineated. approximately 14% of our 2016 capital program, $204 million, is allocated to the oklahoma resource basins, which will support two rigs and lease retention in the stack and delineation of the scoop springer and meramec. our drilling plans for the oklahoma resource basins in 2016 call for drilling and completing 23 - 28 net wells (65 - 75 gross, of which 24 - 27 are company operated wells). we anticipate bringing 20 - 22 gross operated wells to sales during 2016. bakken we hold approximately 277,000 net acres in the bakken shale oil play in north dakota and eastern montana, where we have been operating since 2006. we continue to see improvement in efficiency and well performance through optimizing completion techniques. we successfully completed a 55-well enhanced completion trial program that began in late 2014 and continued through 2015. we will continue executing and evaluating enhanced completion designs, including increased stage counts, high proppant volumes and fluid types as opportunities arise in 2016. our large scale water gathering system is currently handling over 50% of our produced water. with a second phase expected to be fully operational in the second half of 2016, we anticipate this system will manage 80% of produced water by year end. our time to drill a well averaged 15 days spud-to-td in 2015 compared to 17 days in 2014 . we recompleted 11 wells during 2015. in efforts to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local north dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside the state. approximately 13% of our 2016 capital program, $193 million, is allocated to the bakken, which will support one rig in 2016. our 2016 bakken program includes plans to drill 10 - 12 net wells (45 - 55 gross, of which we will operate 8 - 10). we anticipate bringing 13 - 15 gross operated wells to sales during 2016. other north america during 2015, we further emphasized our focus on the u.s. unconventional resource plays, continued to maximize cash generation from our conventional assets and continued to dispose of non-core assets. in august 2015, we closed the sale of our east texas, north louisiana and wilburton, oklahoma natural gas assets. in december 2015, we closed the sale of our operated producing properties in the greater ewing bank area and non-operated producing interests in the petronius field in the gulf of mexico. in february 2016, we closed the sale of our non-operated producing interests in the neptune field in the gulf of mexico. these assets collectively produced approximately 14 mboed in 2015. other north america consists primarily of onshore production operations in wyoming and development activities in the gulf of mexico. in the gulf, development work continues in the gunflint field located on mississippi canyon blocks 948, 949, 992 (n/2) and 993 (n/2). the development wells were completed in 2015. first oil is expected in mid-2016 after the completion of work at the third-party gulfstar 1 host facility. we hold an 18% non-operated working interest in the gunflint field. a deepwater oil discovery on the shenandoah prospect, located on walker ridge block 51, was drilled in 2009. we own a 10% non-operated working interest in this prospect. the first appraisal well on the shenandoah prospect reached total depth in 2013 and was successful. the operator drilled a second appraisal well in 2014, which was unsuccessful. a third appraisal well was spud in 2015, and was successfully sidetracked, logged and cored, finding more than 620 feet of net oil pay. a fourth appraisal well is expected to be spud in the first quarter of 2016. wyoming - we have ongoing waterflood and enhanced oil recovery projects in the mature big horn and wind river basins. marathon is the third largest oil producer in the state of wyoming. we also have conventional natural gas operations in the greater green river basin. our wyoming net sales averaged 17 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 4 mmcfd of natural gas, or 17 mboed, during 2015 compared to 18 mboed in 2014. in addition, marathon owns the 420-mile red butte pipeline which connects oil fields in the big horn basin to both the silvertip station on the montana/wyoming state line and to alternate outlets in casper, wyoming. 8 north america e&amp;p--exploration in september 2015, we announced our intention to scale back our conventional exploration program. our 2016 capital program includes $15 million for conventional exploration. no conventional exploration wells are planned in 2016. our capital program is limited to existing commitments in the gulf of mexico. we continue to evaluate options for utilization of our remaining commitments on the maersk valiant drillship. the rig is currently being operated by our rig share partner, and we anticipate the rig to be available for our use in early 2017. the solomon exploration prospect located on walker ridge block 225 was spud during the second quarter of 2015 and reached total depth in the fourth quarter. the well did encounter the lower tertiary target interval. the well was plugged and abandoned, with well costs charged to dry well expense, and the rig was released with no further activity planned on the block. we hold a 58% operated working interest in this prospect. we hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in alberta, canada, which could be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. these leases cover approximately 142,000 gross ( 54,000 net) acres in four project areas: namur, in which we hold a 70% operated interest; birchwood, in which we hold a 100% operated interest; ells river, in which we hold a 20% non-operated interest; and saleski in which we hold a 33% non-operated interest. during 2015, in connection with our decision to scale back our conventional exploration program, and also after further evaluation of the estimated recoverable resources and our development plans at birchwood, ells river and namur, we impaired the remaining net book values of these in-situ properties. international e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in e.g., gabon, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya and the u.k. we include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international e&amp;p segment. the following table provides net sales volumes for our significant operational areas within this segment: net sales volumes 2015 increase (decrease) 2014 increase (decrease) 2013 equivalent barrels ( mboed ) equatorial guinea 97

and 2013 . africa equatorial guinea production we own a 63% operated working interest under a psc in the alba field which is offshore e.g. operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2015 . in the third quarter of 2015, production was increased as the alba c21 development well came online with higher than expected liquid yields, in combination with a successful well intervention program on five existing alba wells. in january 2016, we completed the installation of an offshore compression platform which is expected to start up mid-2016 following completion of hookup and commissioning activities. the compression project was designed to maintain the production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to eight years. equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52% interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee, that operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant. under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. we also own 60% of egholdings and 45% of ampco, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates an lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to monetize natural gas reserves from the alba field. egholdings' 3.7 mmta lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement through 2023. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 3.6 mmta in 2015 . 9 ampco had gross sales totaling 760 mt in 2015 . production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. libya we hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the sirte basin of eastern libya, where civil and political unrest continues to interrupt our production operations. operations were interrupted in mid-2013 as a result of the shutdown of the es sider crude oil terminal, and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014, production remains shut-in through early 2016. considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels. we and our partners in the waha concessions continue to assess the situation and the condition of our assets in libya. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our libya operations. other international united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42% working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 39% working interest in the east brae field. the brae alpha platform and facilities host the south, central and west brae fields. the north brae and east brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the brae bravo and the east brae platforms, respectively. the east brae platform also hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28% working interest. during the second quarter of 2015, we completed the final three wells of a five-well brae infill drilling program that began in 2014. the strategic location of the brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the brae infrastructure. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage. the working interest owners of the brae area producing assets collectively own a 50% non-operated interest in the sage system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 0.3 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. we own non-operated working interests in the foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main foinaven field, a 47% working interest in east foinaven and a 20% working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the export of foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an fpso to market. all natural gas sales are to the non-operated magnus platform for use as injection gas. kurdistan region of iraq in aggregate, we have approximately 109,000 net acres in the kurdistan region of iraq. we have a 45% operated working interest in the harir block located northeast of erbil. we also have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of erbil: atrush with 15% working interest and sarsang with 20% working interest. on the non-operated atrush block, following the successful appraisal program and a declaration of commerciality, the kurdistan ministry of natural resources approved a plan for field development in september 2013. the development project consists of drilling four production wells and constructing a central processing facility in phase 1 which provides for a 25-year production period. we expect first production in late 2016 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil. subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential phase 2 development could add an additional gross 30 mbbld facility. on the non-operated sarsang block, the swara tika discovery was declared commercial in may 2014 and a field development plan was filed in june 2014. the plan was approved by the kurdistan ministry of natural resources in the fourth quarter of 2015. the first producing well came online in 2014 and the second producing well came online in december 2015. in 2016, an additional well is planned to come on-line. as the development plan progresses, we expect to increase production after 2016. international e&amp;p exploration in september 2015, we announced our intention to scale back our conventional exploration program. our 2016 capital program includes $16 million for conventional exploration. no conventional exploration wells are planned in 2016. our capital program is limited to existing commitments in gabon. equatorial guinea exploration we hold a 63% operated working interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and an 80% operated working interest in the corona well on block d. we plan to develop block d through a unitization with the alba field. negotiations have been substantially completed and approval is expected in 2016. we also have an 80% operated working interest in exploratory block a-12 offshore bioko island, located immediately west of our operated alba field. 10 gabon exploration we hold a 21.25% non-operated working interest in the diaba license g4-223 and its related permit offshore gabon, which covers approximately 2.2 million gross (477,000 net) acres. multiple additional pre-salt prospects have been identified on this license. in august 2014, we signed an exploration and production sharing contract for gabon offshore block g13, which was subsequently re-named tchicuate. the block, which is located in the pre-salt play offshore gabon, encompasses 277,000 acres. the seismic program was completed during 2015 and processing will occur through 2016. we hold a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the block. in the event of development, the republic of gabon will assume a 20% financed interest in the contract upon commencement of production. the state holds additional rights to participate in the block in the future as a co-investor. kurdistan region of iraq during 2015, in connection with our decision to scale back our conventional exploration program, we impaired our investment in the operated harir block. international e&amp;p disposition in the third quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell our east africa exploration acreage in ethiopia and kenya. the kenya transaction closed in february 2016 and the ethiopia transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2016. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this disposition. oil sands mining segment we hold a 20% non-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in alberta, canada. other jv partners include shell canada limited with a 60% ownership interest and chevron canada limited with a 20% ownership interest. shell canada limited operates the joint venture, which produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen into synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the aosp's mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta, and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines. gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net) barrels of bitumen per day. the aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through a series of primary crushers and rotary breakers for particle size reduction. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry is hydro-transported to a primary separation vessel where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile corridor pipeline. the aosp's scotford upgrader is located at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices and the other products are sold in the marketplace. as of december 31, 2015 , we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped surface mineable leases totaling approximately 159,000 gross (32,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2015 averaged 53 mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 45 mbbld. the operating cost structure of our oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. as average price realizations are typically at a discount to wti, the fixed operating cost structure for oil sands mining will not fully track the price realization. significant cost improvement efforts were employed in 2015 resulting in a material reduction to the production cost structure. see item 7. consolidated results of operations: 2015 compared to 2014 for additional detail on production expenses. the governments of alberta and canada agreed to partially fund quest ccs. construction began in 2012 and was completed in february 2015. government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development, construction and operating phases of the project. quest ccs was successfully completed and commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2015. 11 productive and drilling wells for our north

are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. other international ("other int'l"), includes the u.k. and the kurdistan region of iraq. we closed the sale of our east texas/north louisiana/wilburton assets in the third quarter of 2015 and part of our gulf of mexico business in the fourth quarter of 2015. additionally, we closed the sale of our angola assets and our norway business in 2014, and both are represented as discontinued operations ("disc ops") for periods presented. approximately 77% of our proved reserves are located in oecd countries. our december 31, 2015 proved reserves were calculated using the unweighted average of closing prices nearest to the first day of each month within the 12-month period ("sec pricing"). the table below provides the 2015 sec pricing of benchmark prices as well as the unweighted average for the first two months of 2016: sec pricing 2015 2-month average 2016 wti crude oil $ 50.28 $ 34.19 henry hub natural gas $ 2.59 $ 2.28 brent crude oil $ 54.25 $ 34.86 natural gas liquids $ 17.32 $ 12.87 when determining the december 31, 2015 proved reserves for each property, the 2015 sec prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. beginning in the second half of 2014, the crude oil and natural gas benchmarks began to decline and these declines continued through 2015 and into 2016. commodity prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and could decline further. sustained reduced commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and future cash flows of our proved reserves. estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing the reserves as of the end of the year. the decline in commodity prices prompted a concerted effort to reduce the costs of developing and producing reserves. therefore, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future cash flows will be partially offset by the resulting lower costs to develop and produce reserves. a sustained period of lower commodity prices could also result in additional decreases to our near term capital program and deferrals of investment until prices improve. a shifting of capital expenditures into future periods beyond five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves. see item 1a. risk factors for a further discussion of how a substantial extended decline in commodity prices could impact us. as of december 31, 2015, total proved reserves declined 35 mmboe, primarily due to negative revisions in the u.s. totaling 173 mmboe largely a result of reductions to our capital development program which deferred proved undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year plan, as well as routine production. this decline was partially offset by increased reserves from the drilling programs in our u.s. unconventional shale plays totaling 246 mmboe as well as a positive revision of 67 mmboe in osm. the osm revision was a consequence of technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages due to lower realized prices. royalties paid in canada are on a sliding scale; as the sales price of our synthetic crude oil decreases, our royalty rate decreases. see item 8.

4-10 of regulation s-x. crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group, which includes our director of corporate reserves and his staff of reserve coordinators. crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by qualified reserves estimators ("qres"). qres are engineers or geoscientists who hold at least a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed marathon oil's qre training course. all qres must complete a qre refresher course at least once every three years. our corporate reserves group screens all fields with net proved reserves of 20 mmboe or greater, every year, to determine if a field review is required. any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 1 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by a reserve coordinator. our director of corporate reserves, who reports to our vice president, technology and innovation, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. in his 28 years with marathon oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including managing our osm segment. he is a member of the society of petroleum engineers ("spe") and a former member of the petroleum engineering advisory council for the university of texas at austin. estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by glj petroleum consultants ("glj") of calgary, alberta, canada, third-party consultants. their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the individual responsible for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves has 15 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered practicing professional engineer in the province of alberta. audits of estimates we engage third-party consultants to provide, at a minimum, independent estimates for fields that comprise 80% of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. we exceeded this percentage for the four-year period ended december 31, 2015 , with 82% of our total proved reserves independently audited. we have established a tolerance level of +/- 10% such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants for each field are accepted if they are within 10% of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants' initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both parties re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate. in the very limited instances where differences outside the 10% tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and executive management consent is obtained. the audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . 17 during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. ("nsai") prepared a certification of the prior year's reserves for the alba field in e.g. the nsai summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k. members of the nsai team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. the senior technical advisor has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences, with over 15 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. the second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over five years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. both are registered professional engineers in the state of texas. ryder scott company ("ryder scott") also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the team lead for ryder scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott. he is a member of spe, where he served on the oil and gas reserves committee, and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2015 , 603 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, a decrease of 125 mmboe from december 31, 2014 . the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2015 : (mmboe) beginning of year 728 revisions of previous estimates (223 ) improved recovery 1 purchases of reserves in place 1 extensions, discoveries, and other additions 175 dispositions transfers to proved developed (79 ) end of year 603 the revisions to previous estimates were largely due to a result of reductions to our capital development program which deferred proved undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year plan. a total of 139 mmboe was booked as extensions, discoveries or other additions and revisions due to the application of reliable technology. technologies included statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. the observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 47 mmboe in the eagle ford, 14 mmboe in the bakken and 5 mmboe in the oklahoma resource basins due to development drilling and completions. costs incurred in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $1,415 million , $3,149 million and $2,536 million . projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete, or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. of the 603 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2015 , 26% of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g. that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004. during 2012, the compression project received the approval of the e.g. government, fabrication of the new platform began in 2013 and installation of the platform at the alba field occurred in january 2016. commissioning is currently underway, with first production expected by mid-2016. proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development, located in the libyan sahara desert, were booked for the first time in 2010. this development is being executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region leads to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked. interruptions associated with the civil and political unrest have also extended the project duration. operations were interrupted in mid-2013 as a result of the shutdown of the es sider crude oil terminal, and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014, production remains shut-in through early 2016. the operator is committed to the project's completion and continues to assign resources in order to execute the project. our conversion rate for proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for 2015 was 11%. however, excluding the aforementioned long-term projects in e.g. and libya, our 2015 conversion rate would be 15%. furthermore, our 18 5-year annual conversion rate (2011-2015) averaged 21% and would be 32%, excluding the long-term projects in e.g. and libya. all proved undeveloped reserve drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2020. as of december 31, 2015 , future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2016 through 2020 are projected to be $630 million, $859 million, $1,389 million, $1,764 million and $986 million. net production sold north america africa u.s. canada total

supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities - results of operations for oil and gas production activities for more information regarding production costs. n.m. not meaningful information due to limited sales. marketing and midstream our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon, synthetic crude oil and natural gas production. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. as discussed previously, we currently own and operate gathering systems and other midstream assets in some of our production areas. we continue to evaluate midstream infrastructure investments in connection with our development plans. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and synthetic crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2015 , those contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to liquid hydrocarbon production in the eagle ford and bakken, and osm synthetic crude oil production. eagle ford liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from a minimum of 128 mbbld in 2016, decreasing to 51 mbbld through 2020. bakken liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from 10 mbbld to 30 mbbld from 2016 through 2026. synthetic crude oil production sales commitments are 14 mbbld in 2016 and 10 mbbld in 2017. eagle ford natural gas production sales commitments range from a minimum of 210 mmbtu in 2016, decreasing to 46 mmbtu through 2022. our current production rates, forecasts and proved reserves are sufficient to meet these commitments. all of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. certain volumetric requirements can also be met through purchases of third-party volumes. in addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. competition and market conditions competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. we also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. our operating results are affected by price changes for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from oil and gas production and osm operations benefit from higher liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas prices. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, overview market conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations. 20 environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. major u.s. federal statutes include, but are not limited to, the occupational safety and health act ("osha") with respect to the protection of the health and safety of employees, the clean air act ("caa") with respect to air emissions, the federal water pollution control act (also known as the clean water act ("cwa")) with respect to water discharges, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the oil pollution act of 1990 ("opa-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the national environmental policy act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the endangered species act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the u.s. emergency planning and community right-to-know act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. other countries in which we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters. these laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution, recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air and climate change the epa finalized a more stringent national ambient air quality standard ("naaqs") for ozone in october 2015. this more stringent ozone naaqs could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. the epa's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule. in september 2015, the epa published a suite of proposed rules specifically targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, aggregation of air emissions sources and minor source permitting for operations on tribal lands. these rules are expected to be finalized in 2016. if we are unable to comply with the final terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego construction, modification or certain operations. these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. 21 in 2010, the epa promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding proposed regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by the epa). potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. in january 2016, the bureau of land management ( blm ) proposed a rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to blm jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. if the rule is finalized as proposed, it could result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. if we are unable to comply with the final terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. these regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. for example, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the epa research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. in 2015 the blm issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction. while this rule has been stayed nationwide by court ruling, further findings by the court could result in additional changes to this new rule. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. in a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. a 2012 report published by the national academy of sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity; and a 2015 report by researchers at the university of texas has suggested that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region. some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. in addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed including recent negligence suits and a rcra citizen suit in oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. these developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing. increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding induced seismicity 22 could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. transportation a number of state and federal rules apply to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons. in 2014, the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) finalized a rule relating to testing and classification of liquid hydrocarbons and imposing additional restrictions on the types of rail cars that may be used in certain types of liquid hydrocarbon service. although our businesses do not own rail cars and purchasers of our liquid hydrocarbons make arrangements for its transportation, such regulations could increase transportation costs which are passed on to marathon oil by liquid hydrocarbon purchasers. in addition, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, a sub-agency of dot, has proposed or announced the intention to propose various rules related to pipeline transportation of natural gas and/or liquid hydrocarbons. such regulations could increase the regulatory burden on our businesses where we own or operate pipelines or could otherwise increase costs to third parties that are passed on to marathon oil. water in 2014, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the clean water act and its various programs. while these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. if this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of cwa jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. in 2015, sales to irving oil and shell oil and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our total revenues. in 2014, sales to shell oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. in 2013, statoil, the purchaser of the majority of our libyan crude oil, accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 2,611 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2015 . we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees.

the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are uncertain. the recent substantial declines in commodity prices already have adversely affected our business by: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; and increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt. a further prolonged extension of prices at these levels could extend or exacerbate these adverse effects. 25 a substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, including abandonment obligations, which could negatively impact our financial results. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas transportation, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. in addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. if commodity prices remain at or fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations, including abandonment obligations, to us. the inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group. the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were valued based on sec pricing for the periods ended december 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. the table below provides the 2015 sec pricing for certain benchmark prices as well as the unweighted average for the first two months of 2016: sec pricing 2015 2-month average 2016 wti crude oil $ 50.28 $ 34.19 henry hub natural gas $ 2.59 $ 2.28 brent crude oil $ 54.25 $ 34.86 natural gas liquids $ 17.32 $ 12.87 any significant future price change could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. to the extent that commodity prices remain at current or lower levels throughout 2016, a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer classified as proved. this could impact both proved developed producing reserves as well as proved undeveloped reserves. if prices remain at the 2-month average depicted above throughout 2016, a material volume of our proved reserves could become uneconomic and would have to be reclassified to non-proved reserve or resource category. assuming lower sec pricing in 2016, our osm proved reserves represent the largest risk to be reclassified to non-proved reserve or resource category. however, any impact of lower sec pricing will likely be partially offset by continued cost reduction efforts. also, any volumes reclassified to non-proved reserves could return to proved reserves as commodity prices improve. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. 26 reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this annual report on form 10-k should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10% discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and cost effectively; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. 27 future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. 28 we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s., canada, and the european union. internationally, the united nations framework convention on climate change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st conference of the parties in paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius. the agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. the epa has also proposed regulations targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, which are expected to be finalized in 2016. finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing, including the operation of injection wells, could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. for example, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the epa research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. in 2015 the bureau of land management issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction. while this rule has been stayed nationwide by court ruling, further findings by the court could result in additional changes to this new rule. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. in a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. a 2012 report published by the national academy of sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity; and a 2015 report by researchers at the university of texas has suggested that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region. some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. in addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed including recent negligence suits and a rcra citizen suit in oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. these developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing. increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic 29 fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding induced seismicity could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 39% of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes related to continuing operations in 2015 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 56% of our proved crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2015 were located outside the u.s. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries such as e.g., ethiopia, gabon, the kurdistan region of iraq and libya, and in global markets including: changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. for the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the middle east, including bahrain, egypt, iraq, libya, syria, tunisia and yemen. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the u.s. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. our total debt was $7.3 billion as of december 31, 2015. our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 30 a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants. we may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. general economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. a downgrade in our credit rating, particularly below investment grade, could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital, which could adversely affect our business. we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. a downgrade of our credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and restrict our access to the commercial paper market. we could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending program, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. our commodity price risk management may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. 31 if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable 32 or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. 33 we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 60 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, and elsewhere in this report. all forward-looking statements included

texas, with operations in north america, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters are located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our three reportable operating segments is organized based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers. north america e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in north america; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of north america and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g.; and oil sands mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. we were incorporated in 2001. on june 30, 2011, we completed the spin-off of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. strategy and results summary marathon oil's strategy is to safely and sustainably deliver value by investing in low cost, liquids-rich projects with a focus on risk-adjusted rates of return. we are focused in the high quality core of three premier unconventional resource plays in the u.s.: the eagle ford, bakken and oklahoma resource basins. our strategy for our operated conventional producing assets in e.g., the u.k. and the u.s. is to maximize value and cash flow to provide flexibility to invest in the shorter cycle opportunities in the u.s. resource plays. our conventional exploration program is currently limited to existing commitments in the gulf of mexico and gabon. our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("si 7 "): 1. living our values 2. investing in our people 3. continuous improvement in operational and capital efficiency 4. driving profitable and sustainable growth 5. rigorous portfolio management 6. quality and material resource capture 7. delivering long-term shareholder value commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into our business. the low pricing environment has presented several challenges for us and our industry. we responded to the lower commodity prices in a number of ways: reduced our 2015 capital program by approximately 50% from the prior year, down to $3 billion established our 2016 capital program at $1.4 billion exercised cost discipline, significantly reducing drilling and completion, production and general and administrative costs drove sustainable operational efficiency gains in the u.s. unconventional resource plays scaled back our conventional exploration program to focus on our u.s. unconventional resources plays increased our target for non-core asset sales, now $750 million to $1 billion, up from our previous goal of $500 million closed over $300 million of non-core asset sales (excluding closing adjustments) protected our liquidity and capital structure: issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes ($1 billion of which was used to repay the 0.90% senior notes that matured in november 2015) increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion while also extending the maturity date an additional year to may 2020 decreased our quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.05 per share, saving approximately $425 million of cash on an annualized basis 5 in 2015, we continued to focus on the u.s. unconventional resource plays. we progressed co-development in the eagle ford, further delineated austin chalk in the eagle ford along with scoop/stack in the oklahoma resource basins and improved overall competitiveness in the bakken with cost reductions and enhanced completions. our u.s. operations added 73 mmboe proved reserves in 2015, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 107% over the prior year's ending balance. net sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 6% to 438 mboed in 2015 from 415 mboed in 2014. volumes from our three u.s. resource plays totaled 218 mboed, an increase of 20% from 181 mboed in 2014. for the total company, we ended 2015 with proved reserves of approximately 2,163 mmboe as compared to 2,198 mmboe at the end of 2014 . see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - outlook, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and outlook, including the 2016 capital program. the map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations. segment

to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable 32 or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. 33 we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. item 2. properties the location and general character of our principal liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties, oil sands mining properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1. business. estimated net proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and if we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. in the second quarter of 2015, we reviewed our operations and concluded that we do not have the same level of capital needs outside the u.s. as previously expected. therefore, we no longer intend for previously unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $1 billion associated with our canadian operations to be permanently reinvested outside the u.s. as such, none our foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested abroad. our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. we consider a combination of reserve categories related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. assumptions regarding our ability to realize the u.s. federal benefit of foreign tax credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. a sustained decline in commodity prices could cause us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and u.s. federal benefit of foreign tax credits. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our u.s. pension plans and our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. the constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50% highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group. 59 of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of december 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. the hypothetical impacts of a 0.25% change in the discount rates of 4.04% for our u.s. pension plans and 4.36% for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below: impact of a 0.25% increase in discount rate impact of a 0.25% decrease in discount rate (in millions) obligation expense obligation expense u.s. pension plans $ (14 ) $ (1 ) $ 14 $ 1 other u.s. postretirement benefit plans $ (6 ) $ $ 7 $ the asset rate of return assumption for the funded u.s. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55% equity and 45% other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. decreasing the 6.75% asset rate of return assumption by 0.25% would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices as the volatility of these prices continues to impact our industry. we expect commodity prices to remain volatile and unpredictable in the future. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seerisk factors 18 risk factors, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,

resource plays with operations in north america, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our three reportable operating segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers. the three segments are: north america e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in north america; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of north america and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g.; and oil sands mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. we were incorporated in 2001. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and outlook, including our 2017 capital program. the map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations. 5 segment and geographic information for reportable operating segment and geographic financial information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. in the following discussion regarding our north america e&amp;p, international e&amp;p and oil sands mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. north america e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the u.s. our primary focus in the north america e&amp;p segment is concentrated within our three quality unconventional resource plays. north america e&amp;p-- unconventional resource plays oklahoma resource basins we hold approximately 365,000 net surface acres and includes 61,000 net acres added in the payrock acquisition in the stack meramec play during 2016. in the scoop and stack areas we hold net acres with rights to the woodford, springer, meramec, osage, oswego, granite wash and other pennsylvanian and mississippian plays. our primary 2017 focus will be in the meramec play in the stack and the woodford and springer plays in the scoop. eagle ford - we hold approximately 145,000 net acres in south texas where we have been operating since 2011. we operate more than 1,365 gross (962 net) producing wells, 32 central gathering and treating facilities and approximately 865 miles of gathering pipeline in the eagle ford. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes, atascosa and bee counties of south texas. approximately 95% of the crude oil and condensate production is transported by pipeline with connections to multiple sales points. the ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint. bakken we hold approximately 270,000 net acres in north dakota and eastern montana, where we have been operating since 2006. our large scale water gathering system is handling nearly 70% of our produced water. we are currently transporting about 75% of our oil production on pipeline. in an effort to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local north dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside of the state. other north america our remaining properties in north america primarily consist of a number of outside operated assets in the gulf of mexico, the largest of which is the gunflint field located on mississippi canyon blocks 948, 949, 992 (n/2) and 993 (n/2). the gunflint field, in which we hold an 18% non-operated working interest, achieved first oil in the third quarter of 2016. in 2016, we continued our progress on portfolio management, with approximately $1.3 billion of non-core assets sales, which mainly included wyoming and west texas properties. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. international e&amp;p segment we are engaged in a range of activities, including oil and gas exploration, development and production across our international locations in e.g., gabon, the kurdistan region of iraq, libya and the u.k. we include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international e&amp;p segment. africa equatorial guinea production we own a 63% operated working interest under a psc in the alba field which is offshore e.g. operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2016 . equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52% interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee, which operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the lpg plant. the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. we also own 60% of egholdings and 45% of ampco, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates a 3.7 mmta lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the alba field. ampco had gross sales totaling 1,100 mt in 2016 . methanol production is sold to customers in europe and the u.s. the lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement. under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 3.6 mmta in 2016. 6 libya we hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the sirte basin of eastern libya. civil and political unrest has interrupted our production operations in recent years. during 2016, force majeure was lifted in september, production commenced shortly thereafter and liftings resumed in december. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our libya operations. other international united kingdom our operated asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42% working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields, a 39% working interest in the east brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby braemar field. the strategic location of the brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the brae infrastructure. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage. the working interest owners of the brae area producing assets collectively own a 50% non-operated interest in the sage pipeline system, which has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 0.3 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. we own non-operated working interests in the foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main foinaven field, a 47% working interest in east foinaven and a 20% working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the export of foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an fpso to market. all natural gas sales are to the non-operated magnus platform for use as injection gas. kurdistan region of iraq in 2016, we relinquished to the kurdistan regional government our 45% operated working interest in the harir block located northeast of erbil. we have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of erbil: atrush with a 15% working interest and sarsang with a 20% working interest. international e&amp;p exploration equatorial guinea exploration we hold a 63% operated working interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and an 80% operated working interest in the corona well on block d. we plan to develop block d through unitization with the alba field. negotiations have been substantially completed and we are awaiting approval from the host government. gabon exploration we hold a 21.25% non-operated working interest in the diaba license g4-223 and its related permit offshore gabon, and a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the tchicuate block where we have an exploration and production sharing agreement. in 2015, we entered into agreements to sell our east africa exploration acreage in ethiopia and kenya. this transaction closed during the first quarter of 2016. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. oil sands mining segment we hold a 20% non-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in alberta, canada. other jv partners include shell canada limited with a 60% ownership interest and chevron canada limited with a 20% ownership interest. shell canada limited operates the joint venture, which produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen into synthetic crude oils. the aosp's mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta, and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines. gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net) barrels of bitumen per day. as of december 31, 2016 , we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped surface mineable leases totaling approximately 155,000 gross (31,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. reserves proved reserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. other international ("other int'l"), includes the u.k. and the kurdistan region of iraq. approximately 79% of our proved reserves are located in oecd countries. 7 the following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an sec pricing for

total estimated proved reserves of 802 mmbbl of crude oil and condensate, 194 mmbbl of ngls, 2,446 bcf of natural gas, and 692 mmbbl of synthetic crude oil. combined, total estimated proved reserves are 2,096 mmboe, of which liquids represents 81 percent. as of december 31, 2016, we had estimated proved developed reserves totaled 1,544 mmboe or 74% and estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaling 552 mmboe or 26% of our total proved reserves. for additional detail on reserves, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. preparation of reserve estimates all estimates of reserves are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x. crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group ("crg"), which includes our director of corporate reserves and his staff of reserve coordinators. crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by qualified reserves estimators ("qres"). qres are petro-technical professionals located throughout our organization who meet the qualifications we have established for employees engaged in estimating reserves and resources. qres have the education, experience, and training necessary to estimate reserves and resources in a manner consistent with all external reserve estimation regulations and internal resource estimation directives and practices. qres generally hold at least a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed our qre training course. all reserves changes (including proved) must be approved by the crg. additionally, any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the director of corporate reserves. the director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered professional engineer in the state of new mexico. in his 30 years with marathon oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including more recently managing reservoir engineering and geoscience for our eagle ford development in south texas. he is a 25 year member of the society of petroleum engineers ("spe"). technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. the 8 observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared by glj petroleum consultants of calgary, alberta, canada, third-party consultants during 2015 and 2014. their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the individual responsible, during 2015 and 2014, for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves had 15 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered practicing professional engineer in the province of alberta. audits of estimates we engage third-party consultants to provide, at a minimum, independent estimates for fields that comprise 80% of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. we exceeded this percentage for the four-year period ended december 31, 2016 , with 84% of our total proved reserves independently audited. an audit tolerance at a field level of +/- 10%, to our internal estimates, has been established. should the third-party consultants' initial analysis fall outside our tolerance band, both parties will re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate. in the very limited instances where differences outside the 10% tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and executive management consent is obtained. the audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. prepared a reserves certification for the last three reporting periods for the alba field in e.g. the nsai summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k. members of the nsai team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. nsai's technical team members meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves

(b) primarily represents fixed prices under long-term contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and/or egholdings, which are equity method investees. we include our share of income from each of these equity method investees in our international e&amp;p segment. marketing our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2016 , the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following sales commitments: 2017 2018 2019 thereafter commitment period through eagle ford crude and condensate (mbbld) 105 80 66 51 2020 natural gas

or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. certain volumetric requirements can also be met through purchases of third-party volumes. in addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. 13 competition competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. we also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. these laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution, recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air and climate change the epa finalized a more stringent national ambient air quality standard ("naaqs") for ozone in october 2015. this more stringent ozone naaqs could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. the epa's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule. in june 2016, the epa published a suite of final rules specifically targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, aggregation of air emissions sources and minor source permitting for operations on tribal lands. the epa has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities. we are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our operations. if we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego construction or implement modifications to certain operations. these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. 14 in 2010, the epa promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. in october 2015, the epa finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements. these new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. the revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by the epa). potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. in november 2016, the bureau of land management ( blm ) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to blm jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. these regulations are currently subject to a challenge under the congressional review act, which if successful, would result in complete withdrawal of these requirements. if not withdrawn, this rule is expected to result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. if we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. these regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. for example, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. transportation a number of state and federal rules apply to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons. in 2015, the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) finalized a rule relating to testing and classification of liquid hydrocarbons and imposing additional restrictions on the types of rail cars that may be used in certain types of liquid hydrocarbon service. similarly, in august 2016, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration ( phmsa ), a sub-agency of dot, published a final rule setting additional safety requirements and retrofits for rail cars. phmsa is also considering revising its regulations to require particular methods for conducting vapor pressure testing and sampling of unrefined petroleum-based products for transportation. although our businesses do not own rail cars and purchasers of our liquid hydrocarbons make arrangements for its transportation, such regulations could increase transportation costs which are passed on to marathon oil by liquid hydrocarbon purchasers. in addition, phmsa has proposed or announced the intention to propose various rules related to pipeline transportation of natural gas and/or liquid hydrocarbons. for example, in october 2015, phmsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking amending its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations and in april 2016, published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing natural gas transmission and gathering lines. such regulations could increase the regulatory burden on our businesses where we own or operate pipelines or could otherwise increase costs to third parties that are passed on to marathon oil. water in 2014, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the clean water act and its various programs. while these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. if this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of cwa jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. 15 concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. in 2016, sales to irving oil and valero marketing and supply and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 17% and 10% of our total revenues. in 2015, sales to irving oil and shell oil and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our total revenues. in 2014, sales to shell oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 2,117 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2016 . executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon oil and their ages as of february 1, 2017 , are as follows: lee m. tillman 55 president and chief executive officer sylvia j. kerrigan 51 executive vice president, general counsel and secretary t. mitch little 53 executive

factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. when considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. the substantial decline in crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices since 2014 has reduced our operating results and cash flows and, regardless of the recent increase in prices, could still adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. historically, the markets for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. although, prices for wti and brent crude oil, henry hub natural gas and natural gas liquids have increased in the last several months, prices are still significantly below their highs from 2014. many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; the ability of the members of opec and certain non-opec members, such as russia, to agree to and maintain production controls; the production levels of non-opec countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the united states; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are uncertain. historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; and increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt. future decreases in prices could have similar adverse effects on our business. 18 if crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices remain substantially below their 2014 highs or fall below current levels, it could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, including abandonment obligations, which could negatively impact our financial results. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or transportation of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. in addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. if commodity prices remain at or fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations, including abandonment obligations, to us. the inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared, in accordance with sec regulations, by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group. prior to 2016, the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were valued based on sec pricing for the periods ended december 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. the table below provides the 2016 sec pricing for certain benchmark prices: sec pricing 2016 wti crude oil (per bbl) $ 42.75 henry hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 2.49 brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 43.53 mont belvieu ngls (per bbl) $ 15.89 if commodity prices were to significantly drop below average prices used to estimate 2016 proved reserves (see table above), we would expect price related reserve revisions that could have a material impact on proved reserve volumes and the present value of our proved reserves. in this scenario, our osm proved reserves represent the largest risk to be reclassified to non-proved reserves or resource category. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured (bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers and geoscientists, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts: the amount and timing of production; 19 the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and cost effectively; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inflation in exploration and drilling costs; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; 20 shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s., canada, and the european union. internationally, the united nations framework convention on climate change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st conference of the parties in paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius. the agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. the epa has also finalized regulations targeting new sources of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, and has issued requests for information on existing sources. finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our u.s. operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. for example, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in 2015 21 the bureau of land management issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction. while this rule has been stayed nationwide by court ruling, further findings by the court could result in additional changes to this new rule. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. marathon does not currently own or operate water disposal wells in the current areas of interest but does contract for services that regularly inject produced water into underground injection wells. separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. marathon does use hydraulic fracturing techniques throughout its u.s. operations. while the scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. for example, oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity, and has issued guidelines to operators in certain areas of the state curtailing injection of produced water due to seismic concerns. marathon does not currently own or operate injection wells in these areas. further, oklahoma recently issued guidelines to operators for management of anomalous seismicity that may be related to hydraulic fracturing activities in the scoop/stack area. in addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in oklahoma alleging damage from seismicity relating to disposal well operations. marathon has not been named in any of those lawsuits. increased seismicity in oklahoma or other areas could result in additional regulation and restrictions on our operations and could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs. additional regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities. worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 45% of our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil volumes related to continuing operations in 2016 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 55% of our proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves as of december 31, 2016 were located outside the u.s. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries such as e.g., gabon, the kurdistan region of iraq and libya, and in global markets including: changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas or synthetic crude oil and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. 22 for the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the middle east, including bahrain, egypt, iraq, libya, syria, tunisia and yemen. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the u.s. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. as of december 31, 2016, our total debt was $7.3 billion , of which $ 686 million is due within 12 months. our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited; a financial covenant in our credit agreement stipulates that our total debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 65% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and if exceeded, may make additional borrowings more expensive and affect our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy and our industry; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants. we may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. general economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. a further downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital, which could adversely affect our business. 23 we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. due to the decline in crude oil and u.s. natural gas prices in recent years, credit rating agencies reviewed companies in the energy industry, including us. in the first quarter of 2016, our corporate credit rating was downgraded by standard &amp; poor's global ratings to bbb- (stable) from bbb (stable), by fitch ratings to bbb (negative) from bbb+ (stable) and by moody's investor services, inc. to ba1 (negative) from baa1 (stable). on october 11, 2016 moody's subsequently revised their outlook of our corporate credit rating to stable from negative. the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. a further downgrade of our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and may limit or reduce credit lines with our bank counterparties. we could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain contractual obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending program, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. global commodity prices are volatile. in order to mitigate commodity price volatility and increase the predictability of cash flows related to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we, from time to time, enter into crude oil and natural gas hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. while hedging arrangements are intended to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the price levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired 24 properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. 25 in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and

business general marathon oil corporation (nyse: mro) is an independent exploration and production company based in houston, texas, focused on u.s. unconventional resource plays with operations in north america, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our three reportable operating segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers. the three segments are: north america e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in north america; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of north america and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g.; and oil sands mining mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. we were incorporated in 2001. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and outlook, including our 2017 capital program. the map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations. 5 segment and geographic information for reportable operating segment and geographic financial information, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired 24 properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our north america e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. 25 in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. 26 item 2. properties the location and general character of our principal crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas properties, oil sands mining properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1. business. estimated net proved crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 51 income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and if we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. this assessment requires analysis of all available positive and negative evidence. positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies. negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future income (loss) in the realizable period. we expect to be in a cumulative loss position in early 2017, which constitutes significant objective negative evidence as to the future realizability of the value of our deferred tax assets. as a result, we are limited in our ability to consider forecasts for taxable income in future years in connection with our assessment of the realizability of our foreign tax credits and other federal deferred tax assets. additionally, we considered the reversals of existing deferred tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. therefore, we increased our valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets by $1,346 million in 2016. our remaining u.s. operating loss carryforwards of $1.8 billion , which expire in 2035 and 2036, represent the federal deferred tax asset most at risk for an additional valuation allowance at december 31, 2016. see further detail in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices as the volatility of these prices continues to impact our industry. we expect commodity prices to remain volatile and unpredictable in the future. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

mro) is an independent exploration and production company based in houston, texas, focused on u.s. unconventional resource plays with operations in the united states, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our two reportable operating segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. the two segments are: united states e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in the united states; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of the united states and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g. we were incorporated in 2001. our strategy is to deliver competitive returns by focusing on the lowest cost, highest margin u.s. resource plays while maintaining a peer-leading balance sheet. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. we are concentrated on our core operations in our u.s. unconventional resource plays and e.g. the map below shows the locations of our core operations: * our additional locations include the gulf of mexico, u.k., libya, gabon and the kurdistan region of iraq. segment and geographic information in the second quarter of 2017, we closed on the sale of our canadian business which includes our oil sands mining segment and exploration stage in-situ leases. the canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. additionally, we have renamed our north america e&amp;p segment to united states e&amp;p segment, effective june 30, 2017. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. for reportable operating segment and geographic financial information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. in the following discussion regarding our united states e&amp;p and international e&amp;p segments, references to sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. 5 united states e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the u.s. our primary focus in the united states e&amp;p segment is concentrated within our four high quality unconventional resource plays. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further detail on current year results. united states e&amp;p-- unconventional resource plays eagle ford we have been operating in the south texas eagle ford play since 2011, where roughly two thirds of our acreage is located in karnes county and atascosa county. we operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the field that support more than 1,500 producing wells. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes, atascosa and bee counties. bakken we have been operating in north dakota and eastern montana since 2006. the majority of our acreage is in core prospects within mckenzie, mountrail, and dunn counties in north dakota. we continue focusing on the high-return myrmidon area building on the successes from our enhanced completion designs, as well as delineating our position in hector. oklahoma our primary focus in oklahoma has been delineation and leasehold protection in the meramec play in the stack and delineation of the woodford and springer plays in the scoop, as we move toward infill development. we hold net acreage with rights to the woodford, springer, meramec, osage, oswego, granite wash and other pennsylvanian and mississippian plays, with a majority of this in the scoop and stack. northern delaware we closed on multiple permian acquisitions during 2017, with a majority of the acreage in northern delaware. these acquisitions give us a strong foundational footprint in the region where we have begun developing the wolfcamp and bone spring plays. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. other united states our remaining properties in the united states primarily consist of outside operated assets in the gulf of mexico, including the gunflint field where we hold an 18% non-operated working interest. international e&amp;p segment we are engaged in oil and gas development and production across our international locations primarily in e.g., u.k. and libya. we include the results of our lpg processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international e&amp;p segment. international e&amp;p equatorial guinea we own a 63% operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the alba field and an 80% operated working interest in block d, both of which are offshore e.g. block d was unitized with the alba field in second quarter 2017. operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 99% in 2017 . equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52% interest in alba plant llc, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the lpg plant. the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. we also own 60% of egholdings and 45% of ampco, both accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates a 3.7 mmta lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the alba field. the lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled approximately 3.95 mmta in 2017. ampco had gross sales totaling approximately 1,100 mt in 2017 . methanol production is sold to customers in europe and the u.s. united kingdom our operated asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we have a 42% working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields, a 39% working interest in the east brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby braemar field. we own non-operated working interests in the foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main foinaven field, a 47% working interest in east foinaven and a 20% working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. 6 libya we hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the waha concessions, which includes acreage located in the sirte basin of eastern libya. while civil and political unrest has interrupted operations in recent years, our production resumed in october 2016 at our waha concession. during december 2016, liftings resumed from the es sider crude oil terminal. during 2017 sales volumes and production continued, except for a brief interruption in march 2017 due to civil unrest. other international kurdistan region of iraq we have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of erbil: atrush with a 15% working interest and sarsang with a 20% working interest. in 2016, we relinquished to the kurdistan regional government our 45% operated working interest in the harir block located northeast of erbil. gabon we hold a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the tchicuate block where we have an exploration and production sharing agreement. in the third quarter 2017, we entered into separate agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our international e&amp;p segment, and a portion of this transaction closed during the 4th quarter 2017. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. reserves proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. other international ("other int'l"), includes the u.k. and the kurdistan region of iraq. approximately 72% of our proved reserves are located in oecd countries, with 70% located within the u.s. the following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves based upon sec pricing

crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. gross delivery commitments we have committed to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2017 , the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the

of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. in addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. 11 competition competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies. we compete, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical, and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. these laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution or recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air and climate change environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. government entities have filed lawsuits in california and new york seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in six of these lawsuits in california, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. the epa finalized a more stringent national ambient air quality standard ("naaqs") for ozone in october 2015. this more stringent ozone naaqs could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. the epa anticipates promulgating final area designations under the new standard in the first half of 2018. although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of 12 that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. the epa's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule. in november 2016, the bureau of land management ( blm ) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to blm jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. blm issued a two-year stay of these requirements in december 2017 and has indicated that the requirements could be rescinded or significantly revised in the future. if not withdrawn or significantly revised, this rule is expected to result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. if we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. these regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. water in 2014, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the clean water act ("cwa") and its various programs. while these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. if this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of cwa jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. in 2017, sales to vitol and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. in 2016 , sales to valero marketing and supply, tesoro petroleum, and flint hills resources and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% , 11% and 10% of our total revenues. in 2015 , sales to shell oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had approximately 2,300 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2017 . 13 executive officers of the registrant the executive

various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. when considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. a substantial decline in crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. the markets for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, causing prices to fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; the ability of the members of opec and certain non-opec members, such as russia, to agree to and maintain production controls; the production levels of non-opec countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the united states; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are uncertain. historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; and increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and our historical synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared, in accordance with sec regulations, by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group and third-party consultants. prior to 2016, the synthetic 16 crude oil reserves estimates, included in discontinued operations, were prepared by glj, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were valued based on sec pricing for the periods ended december 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. the table below provides the 2017 sec pricing for certain benchmark prices: sec pricing 2017 wti crude oil (per bbl) $ 51.34 henry hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 2.98 brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 54.39 mont belvieu ngls (per bbl) $ 22.03 if commodity prices were to decrease by approximately 10% below average prices used to estimate 2017 proved reserves (see table above), we would not expect price related reserve revisions to have a material impact on proved reserve volumes. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas; the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers and geoscientists, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete projects timely and cost effectively; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. 17 future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inflation in exploration and drilling costs; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices decrease, it could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, including abandonment obligations, which could negatively impact our financial results. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or transportation of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. in addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. if commodity prices decrease, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations, including abandonment obligations, to us. the inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving drilling and completion activities, engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. 18 we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with and changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s. and the european union. internationally, the united nations framework convention on climate change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st conference of the parties in paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius. the agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. the epa has also finalized regulations targeting new sources of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our u.s. operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in 2015 the blm issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction; however, this rule was rescinded in december 2017. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. 19 state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. marathon uses hydraulic fracturing techniques throughout its u.s. operations. while the scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. for example, oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity, and has issued guidelines to operators in certain areas of the state curtailing injection of produced water due to seismic concerns. marathon does not currently own or operate injection wells or contract for such services in these areas. further, oklahoma recently issued guidelines to operators for management of anomalous seismicity that may be related to hydraulic fracturing activities in the scoop/stack area. in addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in oklahoma alleging damage from seismicity relating to disposal well operations. marathon has not been named in any of those lawsuits. increased seismicity in oklahoma or other areas could result in additional regulation and restrictions on our operations and could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs. additional regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities. worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law or policy could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 38% of our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas related to continuing operations in 2017 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 30% of our proved reserves of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas as of december 31, 2017 were located outside the u.s. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries such as e.g., gabon, the kurdistan region of iraq and libya, and in global markets including: changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. for the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the middle east and africa. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the u.s. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. continued hostilities in the middle east and africa and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. 20 actions of governments through tax legislation or interpretations of tax law, and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. as of december 31, 2017 , our total debt was $5.5 billion , with no debt due within the next 24 months. our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited; a financial covenant in our credit agreement stipulates that our total debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 65% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and if exceeded, may make additional borrowings more expensive and affect our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy and our industry; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants. we may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. general economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital, which could adversely affect our business. we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. due to the decline in crude oil and u.s. natural gas prices in recent years, credit rating agencies reviewed companies in the energy industry, including us. at december 31, 2017, our corporate credit ratings were: standard &amp; poor's global ratings services bbb- (stable); fitch ratings bbb (stable); and moody's investor services, inc. ba1 (stable). the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. a downgrade of our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and may limit or reduce credit lines with our bank counterparties. we could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain contractual obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending program, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. 21 our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. global commodity prices are volatile. in order to mitigate commodity price volatility and increase the predictability of cash flows related to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we, from time to time, enter into crude oil and natural gas hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. while hedging arrangements are intended to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the price levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure, or targeting those of our third-party service providers. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, including technologies that are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market, to enable communications, and to provide a host of other support services for our business. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes all users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while we and our third-party service providers commit resources to the design, implementation, and monitoring of our information systems, there is no guarantee that our security measures will provide absolute security. despite these security measures, we may not be able to anticipate, detect, or prevent cyberattacks, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because attackers are increasingly using techniques designed to circumvent controls and avoid detection. we and our third-party service providers may therefore be vulnerable to security events that are beyond our control, and we may be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as physical attacks, which could result in information security breaches and significant disruption to our business. our information systems and related infrastructure have experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, but we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. we may also be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation relating from cybersecurity issues. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and leases. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. 22 we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our united states e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, tornadoes, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. for instance, government entities have filed lawsuits in california and new york seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in six of these lawsuits in california, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot 23 be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 24 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, and

mro) is an independent exploration and production company based in houston, texas, focused on u.s. unconventional resource plays with operations in the united states, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our two reportable operating segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered. the two segments are: united states e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in the united states; international e&amp;p explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of the united states and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g. we were incorporated in 2001. our strategy is to deliver competitive returns by focusing on the lowest cost, highest margin u.s. resource plays while maintaining a peer-leading balance sheet. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. we are concentrated on our core operations in our u.s. unconventional resource plays and e.g. the map below shows the locations of our core operations: * our additional locations include the gulf of mexico, u.k., libya, gabon and the kurdistan region of iraq. segment and geographic information in the second quarter of 2017, we closed on the sale of our canadian business which includes our oil sands mining segment and exploration stage in-situ leases. the canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. additionally, we have renamed our north america e&amp;p segment to united states e&amp;p segment, effective june 30, 2017. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our business could be negatively impacted by cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure, or targeting those of our third-party service providers. our business, like other

and we may be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as physical attacks, which could result in information security breaches and significant disruption to our business. our information systems and

operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and leases. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. 22 we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our united states e&amp;p and international e&amp;p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, tornadoes, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. for instance, government entities have filed lawsuits in california and new york seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in six of these lawsuits in california, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot 23 be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 24 item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. item 2. properties the location and general character of our principal crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1. business. estimated net proved crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves are set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 48 income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. we provide for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; court proceedings; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform legislation"), which made significant changes to u.s. federal income tax law. we expect that certain aspects of the tax reform legislation will positively impact our future after-tax earnings in the u.s., primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. the tax reform legislation is a comprehensive bill containing several other provisions, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, that are not expected to have a material effect on our results. the ultimate impact of the tax reform legislation may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us, as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, ngls, and natural gas prices as the volatility of these prices continues to impact our industry. we expect commodity prices to remain volatile and unpredictable in the future. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seerisk factors 15 risk factors, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition

focused on u.s. resource plays with operations in the united states, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. the two segments are: united states explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in the united states; international explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of the united states and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g. we were incorporated in 2001. on july 1, 2011 we became an independent e&amp;p after we completed the spin-off of our refining, marketing and transportation business, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in the lower cost, higher margin u.s. resource plays while maintaining a peer-leading balance sheet, prioritizing sustainable cash flow generation at conservative oil prices, and returning capital to shareholders. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. our portfolio is concentrated in our core operations in the u.s. resource plays and e.g. the map below shows the locations of our core operations: * our additional locations include the u.k, the kurdistan region of iraq (executed a sales agreement in 2018) and other united states locations. segment information in the following discussion regarding our united states and international segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. during the year, we renamed our united states e&amp;p and international e&amp;p segments to the united states and international segments. the characteristics and composition of these segments remained unchanged and there was no effect on previously reported segment information. see note 1 for further information. 5 united states segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the u.s. our primary focus in the united states segment is concentrated within our four high quality resource plays. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further detail on current year results. united states u.s. resource plays eagle ford we have been operating in the south texas eagle ford play since 2011, where roughly two thirds of our acreage is located in karnes and atascosa counties. our focus is capital efficient development with a goal of maximizing returns and cash flow generation while extending our core acreage. we operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes and atascosa counties. bakken we have been operating in the williston basin since 2006. the majority of our core acreage is within mckenzie, mountrail, and dunn counties in north dakota targeting the middle bakken and three forks reservoirs. we continue focusing our investment in our high-return myrmidon and hector areas, while also delineating our position across the rest of our acreage. oklahoma with a history in oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has recently been the transition to early infill development in the stack meramec and scoop woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our footprint. we primarily hold net acreage with rights to the woodford, springer, meramec, osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the scoop and stack. northern delaware we have been operating in the northern delaware basin, which is located within the greater permian area, since we closed on two major acquisitions in 2017. these acquisitions gave us a strong foundational footprint in the region where we have the majority of our acreage in eddy and lea counties primarily in the wolfcamp and bone spring new mexico plays. our focus since entering the play has been to strategically advance our position and prepare for future development by further coring up our footprint, progressing early delineation of our acreage, improving our cost structure and securing midstream solutions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. other united states our remaining properties in the united states primarily consist of our newly acquired acreage in the emerging louisiana austin chalk play and outside operated assets in the gulf of mexico, including our 3.5% overriding royalty interest in the ursa fields. during 2018 we acquired approximately 260,000 net acres in the louisiana austin chalk play at a cost of less than $850 per acre. additionally, in the fourth quarter 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our working interest in the droshky field, in the gulf of mexico, and as a result it is classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2018 . this transaction closed in the first quarter of 2019. during 2018 we closed on the sale of several non-core conventional properties, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. international segment we are engaged in oil and gas development and production across our international locations primarily in e.g. and u.k. we include the results of our lpg processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international segment. international equatorial guinea we own a 63% operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the alba field and an 80% operated working interest in block d, both of which are offshore e.g. operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2018 . equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52% interest in alba plant llc, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the lpg plant. the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. we also own 60% of egholdings and 45% of ampco, both accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates a 3.7 mmta lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the alba field. the lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. gross sales of lng from this production facility 6 totaled approximately 3.5 mmta in 2018 . ampco had gross sales totaling approximately 1,000 mt in 2018 . methanol production is sold to customers in europe and the u.s. united kingdom our operated assets in the u.k. sector of the north sea are the brae area complex where we have a 42% working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields, a 39% working interest in the east brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby braemar field. we own non-operated working interests in the foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main foinaven field, a 47% working interest in east foinaven and a 20% working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. libya in the first quarter of 2018 , we closed on the sale of our subsidiary, marathon oil libya limited, which held our 16.33% non-operated interest in the waha concessions in libya. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. other international kurdistan region of iraq we have a non-operated 15% working interest in the atrush block located north-northwest of erbil. during the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our kurdistan subsidiary, marathon oil kdv b.v., and as a result it is classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2018 . we expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2019 which will complete our full country exit from kurdistan. additionally during 2018, we entered into separate agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our international segment. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. reserves proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. other international ("other int'l"), includes the u.k. and the kurdistan region of iraq. approximately 86% of our proved reserves are located in oecd countries, with 84% located within the u.s. the following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves based upon sec pricing for period ended december 31, 2018 . december 31, 2018 u.s. e.g. other int'l total proved developed

equity method investees in our international segment. marketing our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. gross delivery commitments we have committed to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2018 , the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the

delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment. in addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. 11 competition competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies. we compete, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical, and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. these laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution or recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies . air and climate change environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states and other jurisdictions seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. the epa finalized a more stringent national ambient air quality standard ( naaqs ) for ozone in october 2015. states that contain any areas designated as non-attainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, will be required to complete development of implementation plans in the 2020-2021 time frame. the epa may in the future designate additional areas as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. although there may be 12 an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. the epa's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule. in november 2016, the bureau of land management ( blm ) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to blm jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. blm issued a two-year stay of these requirements in december 2017. in september 2018, blm published a final rule to rescind substantial portions of the rule. the rescission was challenged by multiple parties in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. if the judicial challenges to the rule are successful and the rule were to come back into effect, the requirements would result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. water in 2014, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal clean water act ( cwa ) and its various programs. while these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. in december 2018, epa and the army corps of engineers issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would amend the 2015 regulations to narrow the scope of federal cwa jurisdiction. if the new proposed rule is not finalized and the 2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of cwa jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors . concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. in 2018 , sales to valero marketing and supply and flint hills resources and each of their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenues. in 2017 , sales to vitol and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. in 2016 , sales to valero marketing and supply, tesoro petroleum, and flint hills resources and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% , 11% and 10% of our total revenues. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold u.s. and foreign patents. although in the aggregate our trademarks and patents are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, or group of related trademarks or patents as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had approximately 2,400 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2018 . 13 executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon oil and their ages as of february 1, 2019 , are as follows: lee m. tillman 57

course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. when considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. a substantial decline in crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. the markets for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, causing prices to fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; the ability of the members of opec and certain non-opec members, such as russia, to agree to and maintain production controls; the production levels of non-opec countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the united states; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are uncertain. historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; 15 requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; and increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas and our historical synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared, in accordance with sec regulations, by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group and third-party consultants. reserves were valued based on sec pricing for the periods ended december 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. the table below provides the 2018 sec pricing for certain benchmark prices: 2018 sec pricing wti crude oil (per bbl) $ 65.56 henry hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 3.05 brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 72.70 mont belvieu ngls (per bbl) $ 26.63 if annual sec crude oil benchmark prices (see table above) were to decrease to approximately $45 per bbl, or 30% below average prices used to estimate 2018 proved reserves, we would not expect price related reserve revisions to have a material impact on proved reserve volumes. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas; the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers and geoscientists, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. 16 if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete projects timely and cost effectively; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inflation in exploration and drilling costs; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of, or disruption in, access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices decrease, it could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, including abandonment obligations, which could negatively impact our financial results. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or transportation of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, with partners, co-working interest owners, and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. in addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. if commodity prices decrease, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations, including abandonment obligations, to us. the inability of our joint venture partners or co-working interest owners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements and joint operating agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving drilling and completion activities, engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; 17 unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in offshore operations may pose risks because of the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with and changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s. and the european union. internationally, the united nations framework convention on climate change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st conference of the parties in paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius. the agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. the epa has also finalized regulations targeting new sources of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our u.s. operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further 18 regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in 2015 the blm issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction; however, this rule was rescinded in december 2017. this rescission is being judicially challenged before the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. marathon uses hydraulic fracturing techniques throughout its u.s. operations. while the scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. for example, oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity, and has issued guidelines to operators in certain areas of the state curtailing injection of produced water due to seismic concerns. marathon does not currently own or operate injection wells or contract for such services in these areas. further, oklahoma issued guidelines to operators for management of anomalous seismicity that may be related to hydraulic fracturing activities in the scoop/stack area. in addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in oklahoma alleging damage from seismicity relating to disposal well operations. marathon has not been named in any of those lawsuits. increased seismicity in oklahoma or other areas could result in additional regulation and restrictions on our operations and could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs. additional regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities. our business could be negatively impacted by cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure, or targeting those of our third-party service providers. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, including technologies that are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market, to enable communications, and to provide a host of other support services for our business. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including "cloud" computing, exposes all users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while we and our third-party service providers commit resources to the design, implementation, and monitoring of our information systems, there is no guarantee that our security measures will provide absolute security. despite these security measures, we may not be able to anticipate, detect, or prevent cyberattacks, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because attackers are increasingly using techniques designed to circumvent controls and avoid detection. we and our third-party service providers may therefore be vulnerable to security events that are beyond our control, and we may be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as physical attacks, which could result in information security breaches and significant disruption to our business. our information systems and related infrastructure have experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, but we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any information 19 systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. we may also be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation relating from cybersecurity issues. our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. as of december 31, 2018 , our total debt was $5.5 billion , with our next debt maturity in the amount of $600 million due in 2020. our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited; a financial covenant in our credit agreement stipulates that our total debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 65% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and if exceeded, may make additional borrowings more expensive and affect our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy and our industry; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants. we may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. general economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital, which could adversely affect our business. we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. due to the volatility in crude oil and u.s. natural gas prices in recent years, credit rating agencies review companies in the energy industry periodically, including us. at december 31, 2018 , our corporate credit ratings were: standard &amp; poor's global ratings services bbb- (positive); fitch ratings bbb (stable); and moody's investor services, inc. ba1 (positive). the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. a downgrade of our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and may limit or reduce credit lines with our bank counterparties. we could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain contractual obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending budget, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. global commodity prices are volatile. in order to mitigate commodity price volatility and increase the predictability of cash flows related to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we, from time to time, enter into crude oil and natural gas hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. while hedging arrangements are intended to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the price levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law or policy could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 29% of our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas related to continuing operations in 2018 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 16% of our proved reserves of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas as of december 31, 2018 were located outside the u.s. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist 20 activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries such as e.g., and the kurdistan region of iraq including: changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. changes in the u.s. or global political and economic environment or any u.s. or global hostility or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. these risks could also cause damage to, or the inability to access production facilities or other operating assets and could limit our service and equipment providers from delivering items necessary for us to conduct our operations. actions of governments through tax legislation or interpretations of tax law, and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and leases. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural 21 gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted jointly with other parties, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production with other parties in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners or co-working interest owners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our united states and international operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, tornadoes, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. for instance, government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. 22 pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, and elsewhere in this report. all forward-looking statements included

houston, texas, focused on u.s. resource plays with operations in the united states, europe and africa. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. the two segments are: united states explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in the united states; international explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of the united states and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g. we were incorporated in 2001. on july 1, 2011 we became an independent e&amp;p after we completed the spin-off of our refining, marketing and transportation business, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in the lower cost, higher margin u.s. resource plays while maintaining a peer-leading balance sheet, prioritizing sustainable cash flow generation at conservative oil prices, and returning capital to shareholders. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. our portfolio is concentrated in our core operations in the u.s. resource plays and e.g. the map below shows the locations of our core operations: * our additional locations include the u.k, the kurdistan region of iraq (executed a sales agreement in 2018) and other united states locations. segment information in the following discussion regarding our united states and international segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. during the year, we renamed our united states e&amp;p and international e&amp;p segments to the united states and international segments. the characteristics and composition of these segments remained unchanged and there was no effect on previously reported segment information. see note 1 for further information. 5 united states segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the u.s. our primary focus in the united states segment is concentrated within our four high quality resource plays. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further detail on current year results. united states u.s. resource plays eagle ford we have been operating in the south texas eagle ford play since 2011, where roughly two thirds of our acreage is located in karnes and atascosa counties. our focus is capital efficient development with a goal of maximizing returns and cash flow generation while extending our core acreage. we operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells. we also own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes and atascosa counties. bakken we have been operating in the williston basin since 2006. the majority of our core acreage is within mckenzie, mountrail, and dunn counties in north dakota targeting the middle bakken and three forks reservoirs. we continue focusing our investment in our high-return myrmidon and hector areas, while also delineating our position across the rest of our acreage. oklahoma with a history in oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has recently been the transition to early infill development in the stack meramec and scoop woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our footprint. we primarily hold net acreage with rights to the woodford, springer, meramec, osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the scoop and stack. northern delaware we have been operating in the northern delaware basin, which is located within the greater permian area, since we closed on two major acquisitions in 2017. these acquisitions gave us a strong foundational footprint in the region where we have the majority of our acreage in eddy and lea counties primarily in the wolfcamp and bone spring new mexico plays. our focus since entering the play has been to strategically advance our position and prepare for future development by further coring up our footprint, progressing early delineation of our acreage, improving our cost structure and securing midstream solutions. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law or policy could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 29% of our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas related to continuing operations in 2018 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 16% of our proved reserves of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas as of december 31, 2018 were located outside the u.s. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist 20 activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries such as e.g., and the kurdistan region of iraq including: changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls or natural gas and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. changes in the u.s. or global political and economic environment or any u.s. or global hostility or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. these risks could also cause damage to, or the inability to access production facilities or other operating assets and could limit our service and equipment providers from delivering items necessary for us to conduct our operations. actions of governments through tax legislation or interpretations of tax law, and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and leases. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural 21 gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted jointly with other parties, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production with other parties in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners or co-working interest owners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our united states and international operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, tornadoes, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. for instance, government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. 22 pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. item 2. properties the location and general character of our principal crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas properties and facilities, and other important physical properties have been described by segment under item 1. business . 23 estimated net proved crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves and the basis for estimating these reserves are set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. we provide for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; court proceedings; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. in accordance with u.s. gaap accounting standards, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets, to the expected realizable amount, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future income (loss) in the realizable period. in making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. we base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. these assumptions are described in further detail above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets. an estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. for example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures. based on the assumptions and judgments described above, as of december 31, 2018 , we reflect a valuation allowance in our consolidated balance sheet of $749 million against our gross deferred tax assets of $ 2.0 billion in various jurisdictions in which we operate. our gross deferred tax assets consist primarily of federal u.s. operating loss carryforwards of $655 million , which will expire in 2035 - 2037, and $472 million in 2018 which can be carried forward indefinitely. since december 31, 2016, we have maintained a full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets. if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses are no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as forecasted projections of taxable income in future years, we would adjust the amount of the federal deferred tax assets considered realizable and reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of adjustment. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, ngls, and natural gas prices as the volatility of these prices continues to impact our industry. we expect commodity prices to remain volatile and unpredictable in the future, we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to commodity price fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seerisk factors 17 risk factors, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, item 7a. quantitative and

and 2. business and properties general marathon oil corporation (nyse: mro) is an independent exploration and production company incorporated in 2001, focused on u.s. resource plays: the eagle ford in texas, the bakken in north dakota, stack and scoop in oklahoma and northern delaware in new mexico. we also have international operations in e.g. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. the two segments are: united states explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in the united states; international explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of the united states as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g. our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in the lower cost, higher margin u.s. resource plays while maintaining a strong balance sheet, prioritizing sustainable cash flow generation over a wide range of commodity prices, and returning capital to shareholders. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. our portfolio is concentrated in our core operations in the u.s. resource plays and e.g. the map below shows the locations of our u.s. operations: 5 segment information in the following discussion regarding our united states and international segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. united states segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the u.s. our primary focus in the united states segment is concentrated within our four high-quality resource plays. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further detail on current year results. united states u.s. resource plays eagle ford we have been operating in the south texas eagle ford play since 2011, where our acreage is located in the high-return karnes, atascosa, gonzales and lavaca counties. our focus is capital efficient development with a goal of maximizing returns and cash flow generation while extending our core acreage. during 2019, we acquired 18,000 net acres adjacent to our existing acreage in the eagle ford, which included production of approximately 7,000 net boed and associated midstream infrastructure. additionally, we operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells as well as own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes and atascosa counties. bakken we have been operating in the williston basin since 2006. the majority of our core acreage is within mckenzie, mountrail, and dunn counties in north dakota targeting the middle bakken and three forks reservoirs. we continue focusing our investment in our high-return myrmidon and hector areas, while also delineating and extending our core acreage across the rest of our position. oklahoma with a history in oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has recently been early infill development in the stack meramec and scoop woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our footprint. we primarily hold net acreage with rights to the woodford, springer, meramec, osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the scoop and stack, with our recent activity in these plays being directed towards the more advantaged overpressured oil areas. northern delaware we have been operating in the northern delaware basin, which is located within the greater permian area, since closing on two major acquisitions in 2017. our focus has been to strategically advance our position and prepare for future development by further coring up our footprint, progressing early delineation of our acreage, improving our cost structure and securing midstream solutions. we have the majority of our acreage in eddy and lea counties primarily in the wolfcamp and bone spring new mexico plays. united states resource exploration our resource exploration properties in the united states include our acquired acreage in the emerging louisiana austin chalk play, with an acreage position focused in the western fairway. our first exploration well is on flowback and well clean-up and we have recently spud on our second exploration well. we also closed on approximately 40,000 net acres in the texas delaware oil play in west texas for $106 million in 2019. international segment we are engaged in oil and gas development and production activities in e.g. we include the results of our investments in the lpg processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international segment. international equatorial guinea we own a 63% operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the alba field and an 80% operated working interest in block d, both of which are offshore e.g. operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2019 . equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52% interest in alba plant llc, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a fixed-price long term contract. the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. 6 we also own 60% of egholdings and 45% of ampco, both accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates a 3.7 mmta lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the alba field. the lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. under the current agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled approximately 3 mmta in 2019 . ampco had gross sales totaling approximately 878 mt in 2019 . methanol production is sold to customers in europe and the u.s. during 2019, we executed agreements for third-party gas through existing e.g. infrastructure, the initial step in creating an e.g. gas hub. natural gas from the alen field will be processed through the existing alba plant llc lpg processing plant and the egholdings lng production facility. first gas sales are expected in early 2021. united kingdom in the third quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our u.k. business, which represents a complete country exit. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. other international kurdistan region of iraq in the second quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our 15% non-operated interest in the atrush block in kurdistan which represents a complete country exit. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. reserves proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. for additional detail on reserves, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - supplementary information on oil

(d) production, severance and property taxes are excluded; however, shipping and handling as well as other operating expenses are included in the production costs used in this calculation. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities - results of operations for oil and gas production activities for more information regarding production costs. marketing our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. 12 major customers we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. in 2019 , sales to marathon petroleum corporation, flint hills resources, valero marketing and supply, and shell trading and each of their respective affiliates, accounted for approximately 13% , 13% , 11% and 10% of our total revenues . in 2018 , sales to valero marketing and supply and flint hills resources and their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenues. in 2017 , sales to vitol and their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. gross delivery commitments we have committed to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. as of december 31, 2019 , the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following commitments: 2020 2021 2022 thereafter commitment period through eagle ford crude and condensate (mbbld) 51 2020 natural gas (mmcfd) 120 56 36 2022 bakken crude and

volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment. in addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. competition competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, and to a lesser extent, companies that supply alternative sources of energy. we compete, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical, and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. see item 1a. risk factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. these laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution or recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil and produced water, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners 13 or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. new laws have been enacted or are otherwise being considered and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies . air and climate change environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship and as required by law, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states and other jurisdictions seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. the epa finalized a more stringent naaqs for ozone in october 2015. states that contain any areas designated as non-attainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, will be required to complete development of implementation plans in the 2020-2022 time frame. the epa may in the future designate additional areas as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate. the epa is also in the process of reviewing the ozone naaqs to determine whether to maintain the 2015 standard or to promulgate a more stringent standard. this review is expected to be complete by december 2020. the implementation of the 2015 standard, or the promulgation of a future more stringent standard, may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia largely upheld epa's 2015 standard in august 2019. no party has sought review of this decision and, therefore, it is final. in november 2016, the blm issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to blm jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. blm issued a two-year stay of these requirements in december 2017. in september 2018, blm published a final rule to rescind substantial portions of the rule. the rescission was challenged by multiple parties in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. if the judicial challenges to the rule are successful and the rule were to come back into effect, the requirements would result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with these initiatives, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. 14 water in 2014, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal cwa and its various programs. while these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule was stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. in october 2019, epa and the army corps of engineers issued a final rule that repealed the 2015 regulations and reinstated the agencies' narrower pre-2015 scope of federal cwa jurisdiction. in january 2020, epa and the army corp of engineers promulgated a new wotus definition that continues to provide a narrower scope of federal cwa jurisdiction than contemplated under the 2015 wotus definition, while also providing for greater predictability and consistency of federal cwa jurisdiction. judicial challenges to epa's october 2019 final rule are currently before multiple federal district courts and challenges to epa's january 2020 final rule are anticipated. if the october 2019 final rule is vacated and the 2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of cwa jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors . trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold u.s. and foreign patents. although in the aggregate our trademarks and patents are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, or group of related trademarks or patents as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had approximately 2,000 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2019 .

affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. when considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under disclosures regarding forward-looking statements and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. a substantial decline in crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. the markets for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, causing prices to fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; the ability of the members of opec and certain non-opec members, such as russia, to agree to and maintain production controls; the production levels of non-opec countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the united states; the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind or solar; the effect of conservation efforts; epidemics or pandemics; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including further legislation requiring, subsidizing or providing tax benefits for the use of alternative energy sources and fuels; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are uncertain. historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by: reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that we can produce economically; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas; and increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt. 17 estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves. the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form 10-k has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. estimates of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas were prepared, in accordance with sec regulations, by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group and third-party consultants. reserves were valued based on sec pricing for the periods ended december 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. the table below provides the 2019 sec pricing for certain benchmark prices: 2019 sec pricing wti crude oil (per bbl) $ 55.69 henry hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 2.58 brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 63.15 mont belvieu ngls (per bbl) $ 18.41 if crude oil prices in the future average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31, 2019 , it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and the value of our business. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas; the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers and geoscientists, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves may decline materially as crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas we produce, our future revenues may decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete projects timely and cost effectively; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and 18 the ability to fund such activity. future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inflation in exploration and drilling costs; fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering; lack of, or disruption in, access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices decrease, it could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us which could negatively impact our financial results. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or transportation of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, with partners, co-working interest owners, and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. in addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. if commodity prices decrease, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations to us. the inability of our joint venture partners or co-working interest owners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements and joint operating agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving drilling and completion activities, engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects. 19 we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with and changes in environmental, health, safety and security law, regulations or requirements or initiatives, including those addressing the impact of global climate change, air emissions or water management, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are currently subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. additionally, states in which we operate may impose additional regulations, legislation, or requirements or begin initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change, air emissions or water management. we have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements or initiatives that are being considered or otherwise implemented. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results could be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in the u.s. internationally, the united nations framework convention on climate change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st conference of the parties in paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius. the agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. our business uses this technique extensively throughout our u.s. operations. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in 2015 the blm issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction; however, this rule was rescinded in december 2017. this rescission is being judicially challenged before the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. 20 the potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. marathon uses hydraulic fracturing techniques throughout its u.s. operations. while the scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. for example, oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity, and has issued guidelines to operators in certain areas of the state curtailing injection of produced water due to seismic concerns. marathon does not currently own or operate injection wells or contract for such services in these areas. further, oklahoma issued guidelines to operators for management of anomalous seismicity that may be related to hydraulic fracturing activities in the scoop/stack area. in addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in oklahoma alleging damage from seismicity relating to disposal well operations. marathon has not been named in any of those lawsuits. increased seismicity in oklahoma or other areas could result in additional regulation and restrictions on our operations and could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs. additional regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in offshore operations may pose risks because of the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. our business could be negatively impacted by cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure, or targeting those of our third-party service providers. our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, including technologies that are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our production and distribution systems in the u.s. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market, to enable communications, and to provide a host of other support services for our business. use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including cloud computing, exposes all users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. while we and our third-party service providers commit resources to the design, implementation, and monitoring of our information systems, there is no guarantee that our security measures will provide absolute security. despite these security measures, we may not be able to anticipate, detect, or prevent cyberattacks, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because attackers are increasingly using techniques designed to circumvent controls and avoid detection. we and our third-party service providers may therefore be vulnerable to security events that are beyond our control, and we may be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as physical attacks, which could result in information security breaches and significant disruption to our business. our information systems and related infrastructure have experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, but we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities. we may also be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation relating from cybersecurity issues. 21 our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. as of december 31, 2019 , our total debt was $5.5 billion , and our next debt maturity is our $1.0 billion 2.8% senior unsecured notes due in 2022. our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited; a financial covenant in our credit agreement stipulates that our total debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 65% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and if exceeded, may make additional borrowings more expensive and affect our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy and our industry; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants. we may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. general economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. difficulty in accessing capital or a significant increase in our costs of accessing capital could adversely affect our business. we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. due to the volatility in crude oil and u.s. natural gas prices in recent years, credit rating agencies review companies in the energy industry periodically, including us. at december 31, 2019 , our corporate credit ratings were: standard &amp; poor's global ratings services bbb (stable); fitch ratings bbb (stable); and moody's investor services, inc. baa3 (stable). the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. a downgrade of our credit ratings or other influences, including third-party groups promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities or pressuring financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with fossil fuel companies, could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and may limit or reduce credit lines with our bank counterparties. we could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain contractual obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending budget, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. global commodity prices are volatile. in order to mitigate commodity price volatility and increase the predictability of cash flows related to the marketing of our crude oil, ngls, and natural gas, we, from time to time, enter into crude oil, ngls, and natural gas hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. while hedging arrangements are intended to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the price levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . political and economic developments and changes in law or policy could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in u.s. and global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. we are subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s. there are also many risks associated with operations in e.g. including the possibility that 22 the government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens. changes in the u.s. or global political and economic environment or any u.s. or global hostility or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. these risks could also cause damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets and could limit our service and equipment providers ability to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. actions of governments through tax legislation or interpretations of tax law, and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. changes in u.s. or foreign laws could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries. our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints. the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering and transportation pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. if any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil. if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and leases. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. 23 we operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. the oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas to end-users. such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. many of our major projects and operations are conducted jointly with other parties, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production with other parties in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners or co-working interest owners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our united states and international operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, tornadoes, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. for instance, government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions and other alleged harm attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. the ultimate outcome and impact to us 24 cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 46 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, and elsewhere in this report. all forward-looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date of this report. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. all subsequent written and oral

and 2. business and properties general marathon oil corporation (nyse: mro) is an independent exploration and production company incorporated in 2001, focused on u.s. resource plays: the eagle ford in texas, the bakken in north dakota, stack and scoop in oklahoma and northern delaware in new mexico. we also have international operations in e.g. our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 san felipe street, houston, texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. the two segments are: united states explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in the united states; international explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas outside of the united states as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, in e.g. our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in the lower cost, higher margin u.s. resource plays while maintaining a strong balance sheet, prioritizing sustainable cash flow generation over a wide range of commodity prices, and returning capital to shareholders. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. our portfolio is concentrated in our core operations in the u.s. resource plays and e.g. the map below shows the locations of our u.s. operations: 5 segment information in the following discussion regarding our united states and international segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. united states segment we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the u.s. our primary focus in the united states segment is concentrated within our four high-quality resource plays. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further detail on current year results. united states u.s. resource plays eagle ford we have been operating in the south texas eagle ford play since 2011, where our acreage is located in the high-return karnes, atascosa, gonzales and lavaca counties. our focus is capital efficient development with a goal of maximizing returns and cash flow generation while extending our core acreage. during 2019, we acquired 18,000 net acres adjacent to our existing acreage in the eagle ford, which included production of approximately 7,000 net boed and associated midstream infrastructure. additionally, we operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells as well as own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in karnes and atascosa counties. bakken we have been operating in the williston basin since 2006. the majority of our core acreage is within mckenzie, mountrail, and dunn counties in north dakota targeting the middle bakken and three forks reservoirs. we continue focusing our investment in our high-return myrmidon and hector areas, while also delineating and extending our core acreage across the rest of our position. oklahoma with a history in oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has recently been early infill development in the stack meramec and scoop woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our footprint. we primarily hold net acreage with rights to the woodford, springer, meramec, osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the scoop and stack, with our recent activity in these plays being directed towards the more advantaged overpressured oil areas. northern delaware we have been operating in the northern delaware basin, which is located within the greater permian area, since closing on two major acquisitions in 2017. our focus has been to strategically advance our position and prepare for future development by further coring up our footprint, progressing early delineation of our acreage, improving our cost structure and securing midstream solutions. we have the majority of our acreage in eddy and lea counties primarily in the wolfcamp and bone spring new mexico plays. united states resource exploration our resource exploration properties in the united states include our acquired acreage in the emerging louisiana austin chalk play, with an acreage position focused in the western fairway. our first exploration well is on flowback and well clean-up and we have recently spud on our second exploration well. we also closed on approximately 40,000 net acres in the texas delaware oil play in west texas for $106 million in 2019. international segment we are engaged in oil and gas development and production activities in e.g. we include the results of our investments in the lpg processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in e.g. in our international segment. international equatorial guinea we own a 63% operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the alba field and an 80% operated working interest in block d, both of which are offshore e.g. operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2019 . equatorial guinea gas processing we own a 52% interest in alba plant llc, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a fixed-price long term contract. the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. 6 we also own 60% of egholdings and 45% of ampco, both accounted for as equity method investments. egholdings operates a 3.7 mmta lng production facility and ampco operates a methanol plant, both located on bioko island. these facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the alba field. the lng production facility sells lng under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. under the current agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled approximately 3 mmta in 2019 . ampco had gross sales totaling approximately 878 mt in 2019 . methanol production is sold to customers in europe and the u.s. during 2019, we executed agreements for third-party gas through existing e.g. infrastructure, the initial step in creating an e.g. gas hub. natural gas from the alen field will be processed through the existing alba plant llc lpg processing plant and the egholdings lng production facility. first gas sales are expected in early 2021. united kingdom in the third quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our u.k. business, which represents a complete country exit. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . political and economic developments and changes in law or policy could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in u.s. and global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. we are subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the u.s.

our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage including at times resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials or entities could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. for instance, government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions and other alleged harm attributable to those fuels. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various theories. marathon oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. the ultimate outcome and impact to us 24 cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. item 1b. unresolved staff comments none. item 3. legal proceedings we are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. while the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . pension plan assets pension plan assets are measured at fair value. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, ngls, and natural gas prices as the volatility of these prices continues to impact our industry. we expect commodity prices to remain volatile and unpredictable in the future. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seequantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipates , believes , estimates , expects , forecasts , plans , predicts or projects or variations of these words, suggesting that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements with respect to marathon may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on the business and financial condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, state or local regulatory authorities. the oil and gas industry is characterized by a large number of companies, none of which is dominant within the industry, but a number of which have greater resources than marathon. marathon must compete with these companies for the rights to explore for oil and gas. marathon expectations as to revenues, margins and income are based upon assumptions as to future prices and volumes of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been driven by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in economic activity and political developments in the world major oil and gas producing areas, including opec member countries. any substantial decline in such prices could have a material adverse effect on marathon results of operations. a decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development. marathon uses commodity-based and financial instrument related derivative instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations. while commodity-based derivative instruments are generally used to reduce risks from unfavorable commodity price movements, they also may limit the opportunity to benefit from favorable movements. levels of hedging activity vary among oil industry competitors and could affect marathon competitive position with respect to those competitors. liquidity factors marathon ability to finance its future business requirements through internally generated funds, proceeds from the sale of stock, borrowings and other external financing sources is affected by the performance of its operations (as measured by various factors, including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance and actions, the overall u.s. financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, by marathon outstanding debt and credit ratings by investor services. factors affecting exploration and production operations projected production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, supply and demand, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production decline rates for mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability and geological and operating considerations. these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) operations are subject to various hazards, including acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas. offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the gulf of mexico, the north sea, the u.k. atlantic margin, the celtic sea, offshore nova scotia and offshore west africa are also subject to severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. development of new production properties in countries outside the united states may require protracted negotiations with host governments and are frequently subject to political considerations, such as tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects. 2 table of contents factors affecting refining, marketing and transportation operations marathon conducts domestic refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) operations primarily through its 62 percent owned consolidated subsidiary, marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ). map refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states. the profitability of these operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks refined and the selling prices of refined products. map is a purchaser of crude oil in order to satisfy its refinery throughput requirements. as a result, its overall profitability could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. refined product margins have been historically volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross margin from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, have imposed (and are expected to continue to impose) increasingly stringent and costly requirements on refining and marketing operations that may have an adverse effect on margins and financial condition. rm&amp;t operations are subject to business interruptions due to unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. factors affecting other energy related businesses marathon operates other businesses that market and transport its own and third-party natural gas, crude oil and products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. the profitability of these operations depends largely on commodity prices, volume deliveries, margins on resale gas, and demand. oerb operations could be impacted by unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, product spills, inclement weather or availability of lng vessels. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. technology factors longer-term projections of corporate strategy, including the viability, timing or expenditures required for capital projects, can be affected by changes in technology, especially innovations in processes used in the exploration, production or refining of hydrocarbons. while specific future changes are difficult to project, recent innovations affecting the oil industry include the development of three-dimensional seismic imaging, deepwater and horizontal drilling capabilities, and improved gas transportation and processing options. part i item 1. and 2. business and properties general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001 (the holding company reorganization ), usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction discussed in the next paragraph (the separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. prior to december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon steel business. on december 31, 2001, marathon disposed of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, marathon certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and, from that date, marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. marathon principal operating subsidiaries are marathon oil company and map. marathon oil company and its predecessors have been engaged in the oil and gas business since 1887. map is 62 percent owned by marathon and 38 percent owned by ashland inc. marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through map; and other energy related businesses. 3 table of contents operating highlights during 2002, marathon: established and strengthened core exploration and production areas through: acquisition and successful integration of equatorial guinea interests, approval of equatorial guinea phase 2a and 2b expansion projects, acquisition of additional upstream interests in norway, first production from camden hills ultra-deepwater gas development, and expansion of powder river basin coal bed natural gas interests. realized exploration success in deepwater focus areas: plutao oil discovery offshore angola, annapolis gas discovery offshore nova scotia, and neptune discovery in deepwater gulf of mexico. advanced its integrated gas strategy through: award of front-end engineering and design contracts for potential equatorial guinea liquefied natural gas ( lng ) manufacturing project and for the proposed tijuana regional energy center, lng import and regasification facility in baja california, and acquisition of elba island, georgia, lng import and regasification capacity. enhanced map asset portfolio through: pilot travel center agreement to purchase 60 retail travel centers, which closed in 2003, commencement of centennial pipeline operations, and beginning of construction on cardinal products pipeline. segment and geographic information for operating segment and geographic information, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements on page f-19. exploration and production marathon is currently conducting exploration and development activities in 10 countries. principal exploration activities are in the united states, the united kingdom, angola, canada, equatorial guinea and norway. principal development activities are in the united states, the united kingdom, canada, equatorial guinea, gabon, ireland, the netherlands and norway. marathon is also pursuing opportunities in north and west africa, the middle east, southeast asia and russia. at year-end 2002, marathon was producing crude oil and/or natural gas in nine countries, including the united states. marathon worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production, including marathon proportionate share of equity investees production, decreased less than one percent from 2001 levels. marathon 2002 worldwide sales of natural gas production, including marathon proportionate share of equity investees production, decreased approximately three percent from 2001. in addition to sales of 481 net million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ) of international natural gas production, marathon sold 4 net mmcfd of natural gas acquired for injection and resale during 2002. in total, marathon 2002 worldwide production averaged 412,000 barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ) per day. in 2003 and 2004, marathon worldwide production is expected to average between 390,000 and 395,000 boe per day, excluding asset sales and dispositions. the above projection of 2003 and 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and natural gas volumes is a forward-looking statement. some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of production include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, reserve replacement rates, production decline rates of mature fields, 4 table of contents timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, future acquisitions or dispositions of producing properties, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statement. united states including marathon proportionate share of equity investee production, approximately 60 percent of marathon 2002 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and 61 percent of its worldwide natural gas production was produced from u.s. operations. marathon ongoing u.s. strategy is to apply its technical expertise in fields with undeveloped potential, to dispose of interests in non-core properties with limited upside potential and high production costs and to acquire interests in properties with development potential. during 2002, marathon drilled 19 gross (12 net) exploratory wells of which 12 gross (8 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 12 wells, 2 gross (1 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. exploration expenditures in the united states during the three-year period ended december 31, 2002 totaled $535 million, of which $184 million was incurred in 2002. development expenditures in the united states during the three-year period ended december 31, 2002, including marathon 85 percent equity interest in the development expenditures of mkm partners l. p. ( mkm ), totaled $950 million, of which $295 million was incurred in 2002. marathon principal u.s. exploration, development and producing areas are located in the gulf of mexico and the states of alaska, new mexico, oklahoma, texas and wyoming. gulf of mexico during 2002, marathon gulf of mexico production averaged 62,500 net barrels per day ( bpd ) of liquid hydrocarbons and 103 net mmcfd of natural gas, representing 50 percent and 14 percent of marathon total u.s. liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, respectively. liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production decreased by 9,100 net bpd and by 8 net mmcfd, respectively, from the prior year, mainly due to adverse weather from tropical storms isidore and lili, well interventions and natural field decline. at year-end 2002, marathon held interests in 10 producing fields and 17 platforms, of which 7 platforms are operated by marathon. production from marathon interests in the deepwater gulf of mexico accounted for approximately 93 percent of its total gulf of mexico production in 2002. major components of marathon deepwater portfolio include the marathon-operated ewing bank 873, 917, and 963 and the outside-operated green canyon 244, viosca knoll 786 and mississippi canyon 348. the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for marathon with the potential to add new reserves and increase production. at the end of 2002, marathon had interests in 155 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 122 in the deepwater area. in 2003, marathon plans to drill, or complete drilling operations on, three or four deepwater wells, including continued appraisal of the neptune discovery. the neptune 3 discovery, located in atwater valley block 617, was drilled to a total depth of 18,643 feet and encountered approximately 150 feet of net pay in two primary intervals. the well is located on the southern portion of the structure and is on trend with the neptune 1 and 2 wells drilled several years ago on blocks 575 and 574, respectfully, which were also successful. the neptune 4 well, located in block 573 along the northern portion of the structure, did not encounter hydrocarbons and was temporarily abandoned in early january 2003. marathon holds a 30 percent working interest in the five blocks comprising the neptune unit. further appraisal drilling of neptune is anticipated in 2003 to determine commerciality. the ozona deep discovery, located in garden banks block 515 was appraised with the drilling of two sidetrack wells in 2002 and was determined to be a smaller, more complicated hydrocarbon accumulation than anticipated. determination of commerciality is ongoing. marathon is operator and has a 68 percent working interest. the camden hills field, located in the deepwater gulf of mexico on mississippi canyon block 348, was discovered in august 1999. it has been developed as a part of the canyon express project, which links wells of the aconcagua, kings peak and camden hills gas fields, approximately 150 miles southeast of new orleans, tying to williams canyon station platform on main pass 261 through the canyon express pipeline infrastructure. the marathon operated camden hills startup in october 2002 sets the world record water depth for production at 7,209 feet, flowing through the world third longest gas gathering line at 57 miles. the camden hills wells 5 table of contents achieved their designed peak gross rate of 100 mmcfd in november 2002. marathon is operator of the camden hills field with a 50 percent interest and also has a 10 percent interest in the canyon express pipeline infrastructure. alaska marathon primary focus in alaska is the expansion of its natural gas business through exploration, development and marketing. marathon production from alaska averaged 166 net mmcfd of natural gas in 2002, compared with 179 net mmcfd in 2001. the decrease in 2002 from 2001 is primarily due to mild temperatures in the first and fourth quarters that reduced local utility demands. during 2002, marathon completed successful drilling operations on four wells in alaska. included in this program was one well related to the natural gas discovery at the ninilchik unit on the kenai peninsula, approximately 35 miles south of kenai, alaska. two wells are scheduled for drilling in 2003, in anticipation of first production on or before january 1, 2004. additional drilling will occur to fully assess and develop the ninilchik unit. marathon is operator of the ninilchik unit with a 60 percent interest. marathon and a co-venturer have formed kenai kachemak pipeline company llc to transport natural gas from the ninilchik unit and other potential southern kenai peninsula gas prospects for sales into the existing cook inlet natural gas infrastructure. new mexico production in new mexico, primarily from the indian basin field, averaged 17,300 net bpd and 137 net mmcfd in 2002, compared with 15,000 net bpd and 150 net mmcfd in 2001. the increase in liquid hydrocarbon production was primarily due to ongoing development of the indian basin field and was preceded by the expansion in 2000 of marathon indian basin gas plant. gas production was down primarily as a result of the disposition of certain properties in the san juan basin. in 2002, eight marathon operated development wells were completed in the indian basin field targeting both oil and gas, focused in the eastern area of the field. these new wells, combined with several recompletions of existing gas wells, increased gross oil production from 6,500 bpd to over 9,000 bpd. these wells also helped keep gas production relatively flat in 2002, ending the year at 165 gross mmcfd from marathon-operated wells. in 2003, seven new well completions and several recompletions are planned in the east indian basin area targeting both oil and gas. oklahoma gas production for 2002 averaged 108 net mmcfd representing 15 percent of marathon total u.s. gas production, compared with 124 net mmcfd in 2001. the decrease in gas production was primarily due to the natural field decline in knox morrow. in 2002, marathon southern anadarko basin exploration efforts concentrated on the western extension of the cement field sycamore/springer play as well as the granite wash/cisco prospects located in the marlow field. exploration drilling efforts resulted in four discoveries. marathon drilled or participated in the drilling of 14 development wells to further develop the 1998 granite wash discovery in western oklahoma. current net production from the granite wash area stands at approximately 24 mmcfd. in 2003, granite wash development will continue as marathon plans to participate in the drilling of ten additional development wells. southern oklahoma 2002 development efforts focused on springer/sycamore development in the cement field. marathon participated in the drilling of eleven springer/sycamore development wells in 2002. total springer/sycamore production in the cement field is currently 29 net mmcfd. in 2003, marathon plans to continue its cement springer/sycamore development by drilling, or participating in the drilling of seven additional wells. development plans for 2003 include participation in the drilling of six wells targeting cisco/hoxbar development in the marlow field, located in stephens county, oklahoma. development drilling of an arbuckle test began late in the year and will continue into early 2003. texas onshore production for 2002 averaged 15,892 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 84 net mmcfd of natural gas, representing 13 percent of marathon total u.s. liquid hydrocarbon and 11 percent of natural gas production. liquid production volumes decreased by 1,506 net bpd from 2001 levels and gas volumes decreased by 27 net mmcfd from 2001 levels. the volume decreases were due to property dispositions and natural field decline. in east texas, marathon drilled 15 wells in the mimms creek field with drilling operations continuing at year-end. the 2002 drilling program has resulted in mimms creek net production increasing from 5 mmcfd to a peak of 11 mmcfd. current net production in the mimms creek field is 9 mmcfd. 6 table of contents in the james lime play, marathon drilled six wells in the bridges east field. in 2003, two more wells are projected to be drilled. wyoming liquid hydrocarbon production for 2002 averaged 22,800 net bpd compared with 24,600 net bpd in 2001, representing 18 percent of marathon total u.s. liquid hydrocarbon production. average gas production increased to 125 net mmcfd in 2002, compared to 90 net mmcfd in 2001, as a result of additional coal bed natural gas wells coming on line in the powder river basin ( prb ) and the acquisition of additional interests in coal bed natural gas wells in the prb. in early 2001, marathon completed the acquisition of pennaco energy inc., creating a new core area of coal bed natural gas production in the prb of wyoming. marathon expanded its prb assets by approximately one-third in may 2002 as a result of the acquisition of the assets owned by its major partner in this basin. marathon now controls more than 650,000 net acres in northeast wyoming and southeast montana and is the largest individual acreage holder in the prb. this area remains one of the most active onshore natural gas plays in the continental u.s. during 2002, marathon drilled approximately 164 net wells. development activity together with acquisitions increased proved year-end 2002 reserves of coal bed natural gas to 417 net bcf as compared to year-end 2001 reserves of approximately 256 net bcf. for 2002, annualized production rates of coal bed natural gas were 79 net mmcfd, an increase of 32 net mmcfd from a year earlier. the december 2002 rate averaged 91 net mmcfd. the 2003 plan is currently estimated to include the drilling of 400 to 500 net coal bed natural gas wells in the prb. international europe u.k. north sea marathon primary asset in the u.k. north sea is in the brae area where it is the operator and owns a 42 percent interest in the south, central, north, and west brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the east brae field. production from the brae area averaged 20,100 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2002, compared with 21,700 net bpd in 2001. the decrease resulted from the natural decline in existing fields partially offset by successful development and remedial well work. marathon total brae gas sales from all sources averaged 198 net mmcfd in 2002, compared with 242 net mmcfd in 2001. of these totals, 194 mmcfd and 234 mmcfd was brae-area gas in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and 4 mmcfd and 8 mmcfd was gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale in 2002 and 2001, respectively. the decrease resulted from decreased allocated capacity on the scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system due to the beryl field coming on line. the brae a platform and facilities act as the host for the underlying south brae field, adjacent central brae field and west brae/sedgwick fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field are gas-condensate fields. these fields are produced using the gas cycling technique, whereby gas is injected into the reservoir for pressure maintenance, improved sweep efficiency and increased condensate liquid recovery. although partial cycling continues, the majority of north brae gas is being transferred to the east brae reservoir for pressure maintenance and sales. the strategic location of the brae a, brae b and east brae platforms and pipeline infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, there are 18 agreements with third-party fields contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae-area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the facilities. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated sage system. the other 50 percent is owned by the beryl group. the sage pipeline provides transportation for brae and beryl area gas and has a total wet gas capacity of approximately 1.0 bcfd. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland provides processing for gas from the sage pipeline and processing for 0.8 bcfd of third party gas from the britannia field. marathon is continuing its development of the brae area. during 2002, marathon participated in a successful central brae well. the well was completed as a producer from the brae b platform in february 2002. an additional central brae well, drilled from the brae b platform, is planned for 2003. in august 2002, the braemar development in which marathon has a 28 percent interest was sanctioned. the development is comprised of a single subsea well development tied back to the east brae platform. first oil from the field is scheduled for october 2003. in august 2002, a 16-inch pipeline link, linkline, between the marathon 7 table of contents operated brae b platform and the outside-operated miller platform was sanctioned. marathon has a 19 percent interest in the linkline. the linkline will initially be used for transportation of braemar gas that has been sold to the miller group for their water alternating gas project in the miller field. as part of an ongoing rationalization of the european business unit, marathon reduced its u.k. leasehold interests from 34 blocks at the start of 2002 to 24 blocks as of december 31, 2002. u.k. atlantic margin marathon has a non-operated interest averaging approximately 30 percent in the foinhaven area. this is made up of a 28 percent interest in the main foinhaven field, 47 percent of east foinhaven and 20 percent of the single well t35 accumulation. production from the foinaven fields averaged 31,000 net bpd and 9 net mmcfd in 2002, compared to 24,000 net bpd in 2001. sales of foinaven-associated gas via the west of shetland pipeline system commenced in april 2002. all sales are to the outside-operated magnus group. full foinaven export rates of gross 50 mmcfd were achieved in november after magnus commissioned their gas injection compressor. ireland marathon holds a 100 percent interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale fields in the irish celtic sea. natural gas sales were 81 net mmcfd in 2002, compared with 79 net mmcfd in 2001. in fourth quarter 2002, marathon announced it will be drilling and developing an additional subsea gas well in the kinsale head area. the greensand subsea gas well, which is expected to be drilled in 2003, is designed to enhance the productivity of the main kinsale head natural gas producing greensand reservoir. the well will target the southwestern part of the reservoir that is not being adequately drained by existing kinsale head platform wells. during 2002, an agreement was entered into with the seven heads group to provide gas processing and transportation services, as well as field operating services for the seven heads gas being brought to the kinsale offshore production facilities beginning in 2003. this agreement will result in marathon providing capacity to process and transport between 60 mmcfd to 100 mmcfd of seven heads gas and enhances the value and utilization of marathon kinsale head infrastructure. during 2001, a petroleum lease was issued for the corrib field in license 2/93, located 40 miles off the west coast of ireland. the development will consist of six subsea wells, tied back to a processing terminal onshore via a 20-inch pipeline. final planning approval for the onshore terminal is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2003. with approximately two years of onshore and offshore construction activities thereafter, production startup is targeted for first quarter of 2005. marathon has an 18 percent non-operating interest in the corrib field. norway in the norwegian north sea, total net production averaged 800 bpd and 15 mmcfd in 2002. in 2000, marathon participated in a project to modify the heimdal platform to a processing and transportation center for third-party business. marathon owns a 24 percent interest in the heimdal field and gas-condensate processing center. marathon owns a 47 percent interest in the vale field which is located northeast of the heimdal field in 374 feet of water. this single subsea well tied back to the heimdal platform came on line in june 2002. a further exploration prospect exists on this license and it is planned to drill in late 2003 or early 2004. following the successful acquisition of a 20 percent interest in license pl102, the norwegian government approved the outside-operated byggve/skirne gas-condensate field plan of development. this two well development will be tied back to the heimdal platform gas processing center, with first production expected early 2004. condensate export will be via the heimdal-brae-forties system and gas export via the gasled, statpipe or vesterled systems. marathon also obtained interests in licenses pl088, pl150 and pl203 through acquisitions in 2001 and 2002. ownership is currently 50 percent in licenses pl088 and pl150, and 65 percent in license pl203. marathon obtained operatorship of the pl203 license from the norwegian government in june 2002 and established an office in stavanger, norway. to further delineate and evaluate these licenses, two exploration wells are expected to be drilled on pl203 and one on pl088 in 2003. in the norwegian north sea, between the heimdal field and the u.k. north sea brae area, marathon is evaluating the exploration potential on three additional licenses (pl025, pl187 and pl204) where marathon holds interests of between 10 and 30 percent. 8 table of contents netherlands marathon 50 percent equity method interest in clam petroleum b. v. ( clam ) provides a five percent entitlement in the production from 25 gas fields, which provided sales of 25 net mmcfd of natural gas in 2002, compared with 31 net mmcfd in 2001. the decrease was mainly due to a planned shutdown to install and commission new export compression modules. in 2002, clam participated in four development wells and four exploration wells in the dutch sector of the north sea. independent of its interest in clam, marathon holds a 24 percent working interest in the a-15 block in the dutch sector of the north sea. evaluation of the exploration potential is expected to continue during 2003. west africa equatorial guinea during 2002, in two separate transactions, marathon acquired interests in the alba field and certain other related assets. on january 3, 2002, marathon acquired certain interests from cms energy corporation for $1.005 billion. marathon acquired three entities that owned a combined 52 percent working interest in the alba production sharing contract ( alba psc ) and a net 43 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant through an equity method investee. additionally, marathon acquired a 45 percent net interest in an onshore methanol production plant through an equity method investee, which is reported in the other energy related business ( oerb ) segment. on june 20, 2002, marathon acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of globex energy, inc. ( globex ) for $155 million. globex owned an additional 11 percent working interest in the alba psc and an additional net 9 percent interest in the onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant. the existing production facilities include two offshore platforms, five wells and an onshore condensate stabilization plant. these facilities currently produce gross hydrocarbon volumes of 22,000 bpd of condensate and 130 mmcfd of gas. the government of equatorial guinea approved the alba psc phase 2 development plan. the phase 2 development plan increases gross production capacity and expands the condensate recovery and lpg facilities to increase liquids processing capabilities. the first phase of additional development targeted for the alba field is known as phase 2a. the project includes two new shallow water platforms, twelve new production and gas injection wells, pipelines and expansion of onshore condensate processing facilities and gas reinjection compression on bioko island. it is expected to increase gross condensate production to 46,000 (26,000 net) bpd. gas not used in methanol production or fuel will be moved offshore for reinjection at a rate of approximately 600 gross mmcfd. the government of equatorial guinea approved the 2a project in september 2002. construction of this project has commenced, with startup scheduled for fourth quarter of 2003. the second phase of additional development is known as phase 2b. this project is scheduled to further ramp up production in fourth quarter of 2004. the project includes a new lpg cryogenic gas plant and associated storage, marine terminal and fractionation equipment for propane and heavier gas components. this addition will accommodate additional gross production of 8,000 (4,000 net) bpd of condensate and 13,000 (7,500 net) bpd of lpg. design work for this phase commenced during 2002 and the plan of development for phase 2b received government approval at the end of 2002. future development of the alba field is being considered to monetize the gas. as a result of these acquisitions and the approval of the phase 2 development plan, marathon added 305 million boe to its proved reserves. in 2002, marathon drilled two development wells and acquired a three-dimensional ( 3-d ) seismic survey in preparation for the production ramp-up associated with the phase 2 development of the alba field. production averaged 8,500 net bpd and 53 net mmcfd in 2002. the 2003 drilling program is scheduled for a total of six wells. exploration plans for 2003 include the drilling of up to four wells, one of which will be a deeper test of the alba field. gabon marathon is operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and marin fields with a 56 percent working interest. production in gabon averaged 16,700 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2002, compared with 16,000 net bpd in 2001. in 2002, marathon installed a 44-kilometer pipeline from the tchatamba field to the outside-operated cap lopez pipeline system onshore and began producing oil into that line in december. the leased floating storage and offloading facility was released in january 2003, improving long-term reliability of export operations. also in 2002, marathon installed production facilities for the development of the azile reservoir. the first completion in the azile reservoir is scheduled for the first quarter of 2003. a development well is targeted for the madiela reservoir for the first quarter of 2003. 9 table of contents angola in may 1999, marathon was awarded working interests of 10 percent each in blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola. in september 2002, marathon was awarded an additional 20 percent working interest in block 32. marathon participated in the first ultra-deepwater discovery offshore angola in block 31. the discovery, the plutao 1-a, was drilled to a depth of 14,607 feet in 6,628 feet of water and tested 5,357 bpd through a 48/64 inch choke. two exploration wells are planned for 2003 in block 31. in block 32, marathon and co-venturers drilled the gindungo 1 well to a depth of 15,665 feet in 4,756 feet of water. plans are to test two zones in this well. one or two additional wells are planned for 2003 in block 32. other international australia through the globex acquisition, marathon acquired a 13 percent working interest in the stag field and three exploration blocks offshore western australia. current net production averages approximately 1,600 net bpd. canada net production in canada averaged 4,300 bpd and 104 mmcfd in 2002, compared with 11,000 bpd and 123 mmcfd in 2001. the decline in production was related to divestitures of non-core conventional oil and gas and all heavy oil assets during 2001. marathon onshore canadian exploration efforts are concentrated in two areas of western canada. in south central alberta, the success of marathon drilling program exceeds ninety percent. the wells are shallow and the geologic setting is such that each well has several reservoir objectives. for 2003, 35 core area step-out wells are planned. the second area of focus in western canada is in the milo lake area of northern british columbia. during 2002 and 2001, marathon drilled two successful wells. the 2003 program includes plans to finish the installation of production facilities and pipelines, tie-in the two successful wells, startup production and drill three additional prospects. in addition to three existing leases, marathon was awarded two additional offshore nova scotia deepwater exploration licenses in 2002. marathon has a 100 and 50 percent interest in exploration licenses ( el ) 2410 and 2411, respectively. marathon sold its 34 percent interest in el 2384 (torbrook) in 2002. this brings marathon total offshore nova scotia exploration license acreage to 1.3 million gross acres, positioning marathon as a major player in the developing deepwater atlantic canada gas province. one deepwater gas discovery well was drilled in 2002 in el 2377 (annapolis). it is anticipated that one to two deepwater wells will be drilled on annapolis in 2003, and that an extensive 3-d seismic survey will be acquired on el 2410 (cortland) and el 2411 (empire) licenses. the above discussions include forward-looking statements concerning various projects, drilling plans, expected production and sales levels, reserves and dates of initial production, which are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, amount of capital available for exploration and development, worldwide supply and demand for petroleum products, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production decline rates of mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability, license relinquishments and other geological, operating and economic considerations. offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the gulf of mexico, the north sea, the u.k. atlantic margin, the celtic sea, offshore nova scotia and offshore west africa are also subject to severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. in addition, development of new production properties in countries outside the united states may require protracted negotiations with host governments and is frequently subject to political considerations and tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate and/or negotiations and other considerations are not satisfactorily resolved, actual results could be materially different than present expectations. reserves at december 31, 2002, marathon net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, including its proportionate share of equity investees net proved reserves, totaled approximately 1.3 billion boe, of which 56 percent were located in the united states. (for purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain boe.) on a boe basis, excluding dispositions, marathon replaced 262 percent of its 2002 worldwide oil and gas production. including dispositions, marathon replaced 259 percent of worldwide oil and gas production. 10 table of contents the table below sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years. estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at december 31 developed developed and undeveloped (millions of barrels) 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 liquid hydrocarbons united states 226 243 414 245 268 458 europe 63 69 74 76 88 108 west africa 113 14 18 203 17 23 other international 11 11 39 13 13 128 total consolidated 413 337 545 537 386 717 equity investees (a) 177 178 183 184 worldwide 590 515 545 720 570 717 developed reserves as % of total net proved reserves 81.9% 90.4% 76.0% (billions of cubic feet) natural gas united states 1,206 1,308 1,421 1,724 1,793 1,914 europe 408 473 563 562 615 614 west africa 552 653 other international 290 308 381 379 399 477 total consolidated 2,456 2,089 2,365 3,318 2,807 3,005 equity investee (b) 36 32 52 59 51 89 worldwide 2,492 2,121 2,417 3,377 2,858 3,094 developed reserves as % of total net proved reserves 73.8% 74.2% 78.1% (millions of barrels) total boe united states 427 461 651 532 567 777 europe 132 148 168 170 190 211 west africa 205 14 18 312 17 23 other international 59 62 103 76 79 208 total consolidated 823 685 940 1,090 853 1,219 equity investees (a) 183 183 9 193 193 15 worldwide 1,006 868 949 1,283 1,046 1,234 developed reserves as % of total net proved reserves 78.4% 83.0% 76.9% (a) represents marathon equity interests in mkm and clam in 2002 and 2001 and clam in 2000.

reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries have the capability to process a wide variety of crude oils and to produce typical refinery products, including reformulated gasoline. map refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect the refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city and catlettsburg to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available; gas oil may be moved from robinson to detroit and catlettsburg where excess fluid catalytic cracking unit capacity is available; and light cycle oil may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess desulfurization capacity is available. map also produces asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. map manufactures petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, map manufactures aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene and slack wax. 15 table of

performed at each refinery. map completed major turnarounds at its robinson and st. paul park refineries in the fourth quarter of 2002. the garyville, louisiana coker unit project achieved mechanical completion in october 2001 and was operating at full production capacity by mid-december 2001. to supply this new unit, map entered into a multi-year contract with p.m.i. comercio internacional, s.a. de c.v., an affiliate of petroleos mexicanos s.a., to purchase approximately 90,000 bpd of heavy mayan crude oil. the contract was increased to approximately 100,000 bpd in july 2002. at its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has initiated a multi-year $350 million integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. this program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will reduce the refinery total gasoline pool sulfur below 30 parts per million, thereby eliminating the need for additional low sulfur gasoline compliance investments at the refinery. the project is expected to be completed in late 2003. marketing in 2002, map refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 19.1 billion gallons (1,247,000 bpd). excluding sales related to matching buy/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for about 68 percent of map refined product sales volumes in 2002. approximately 48 percent of map gasoline volumes and 90 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2002. about half of map propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 10 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. the map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. 16 table of contents the following table sets forth the volume of map consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined

branded retail outlets located primarily in michigan, ohio, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in florida, georgia, wisconsin, west virginia, minnesota, tennessee, virginia, pennsylvania, north carolina, south carolina and alabama. retail sales of gasoline and diesel fuel were also made through company-operated outlets by a wholly owned map subsidiary, speedway superamerica llc ( ssa ). as of december 31, 2002, this subsidiary had 2,006 retail outlets in 13 states that sold petroleum products and convenience-store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names speedway and superamerica . excluding the former ssa travel centers contributed to pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ) in 2001, ssa revenues from the sale of convenience-store merchandise totaled $2.4 billion in 2002, compared with $2.3 billion in 2001. profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. ptc, a joint venture with pilot corporation ( pilot ), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with about 225 locations in 34 states. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand name restaurants. ptc provides map with the opportunity to participate in the travel center business on a nationwide basis. pilot and map each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. on february 27, 2003, ptc purchased 60 retail travel centers including fuel inventory, merchandise and supplies. the 60 locations are in 15 states, primarily in the midwest, southeast and southwest regions of the country. during 2002, ssa sold all of its convenience stores in tennessee and louisiana and most of its stores in georgia. on february 7, 2003, ssa announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell all 193 of its convenience stores located in florida, south carolina, north carolina and georgia for $140 million plus store inventory. the transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2003, subject to any necessary regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. map retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa midwest operations, additional growth in the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. supply and transportation map obtains the crude oil it processes from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. in 2002, map net purchases of u.s. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged 433,000 bpd, including a net 44,000 bpd from marathon. in 2002, canada was the source for 13 percent or 114,000 bpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 39 percent or 359,000 bpd of the crude oil processed by map refineries, including approximately 215,000 bpd from the middle east. this crude was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and traders. 17 table of contents map operates a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to its refineries and refined products to its marketing areas. at december 31, 2002, map owned, leased or had an ownership interest in approximately 3,410 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,732 miles of product trunk lines. map owned a 47 percent interest in loop llc ( loop ), which is the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana; a 50 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; and a 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois. map also has a 33 percent ownership interest in minnesota pipe line company, which owns a crude oil pipeline in minnesota. minnesota pipe line company provides map with access to crude oil common carrier transportation from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of map st. paul park, minnesota refinery. as of december 31, 2002, map had a 33 percent ownership interest in centennial pipeline llc, and marathon ashland pipe line llc has been designated operator of the pipeline. the centennial pipeline system that connects gulf coast refineries with the midwest market has the initial design capacity to transport approximately 210,000 barrels per day of refined petroleum products and began deliveries of refined products in april 2002. on february 10, 2003, map increased its ownership in centennial pipeline llc from 33 percent to 50 percent and as of that date, centennial pipeline llc is owned 50 percent each by map and te products pipeline company, limited partnership. a map subsidiary, ohio river pipe line llc ( orpl ), is building a pipeline from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio. orpl is a common carrier pipeline company, and the pipeline will be an interstate common carrier pipeline. the pipeline is currently known as cardinal products pipeline and is expected to initially move approximately 50,000 barrels per day of refined petroleum into the central ohio region. orpl has secured all of the rights-of-way required to build the pipeline, and final permits required to build the pipeline have been approved. construction on the pipeline began in august 2002, with startup of the pipeline expected midyear 2003. map eighty-six light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeast. these facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. map marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. map also leases and owns rail cars in various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors, tank trailers and general service trucks. the above rm&amp;t discussions include forward-looking statements concerning anticipated completion of refinery projects, start-up of a pipeline project and the disposition of ssa stores. some factors that could potentially cause actual results for the refinery and pipeline projects to differ materially from present expectations include (among others) price of petroleum products, levels of cash flow from operations, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and the completion of construction. some factors that could affect the ssa store sales include the inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals, and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. this forward-looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ from those presently anticipated. other energy related businesses marathon operates other businesses that market and transport its own and third-party natural gas, crude oil and products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. some of these businesses, as well as other business projects under development, comprise marathon emerging integrated gas strategy. marathon owns an interest in the following pipeline systems that were not contributed to map: a 29 percent interest in odyssey pipeline llc and a 28 percent interest in poseidon oil pipeline company, llc (both gulf of mexico crude oil pipeline systems); a 24 percent interest in nautilus pipeline company, llc and a 24 percent interest in manta ray offshore gathering company, llc (both gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems); and a 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company and a 3 percent interest in colonial pipeline company (both light product pipeline systems extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest and east coast, respectively). 18 table of contents marathon owns a 34 percent ownership interest in the neptune natural gas processing plant located in st. mary parish, louisiana, which commenced operations on march 20, 2000. the plant has the capacity to process 300 mmcfd of natural gas, which is transported on the nautilus pipeline system. in addition to the sale of its own oil and natural gas production, marathon purchases oil and gas from third party producers and marketers for resale. marathon owns a 30 percent ownership in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefication plant and leases two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of marathon natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, the lng has been sold under a long-term contract with two of japan largest utility companies. marathon has a 30 percent participation in this contract, which has been extended to continue through march 31, 2009. lng deliveries totaled 63 gross bcf (19 net bcf) in 2002. on january 3, 2002, marathon acquired a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea from cms energy. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of marathon natural gas production in the alba field. methanol production totaled 719,000 gross metric tons (324,000 net metric tons) in 2002. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. in august 2002, marathon acquired the rights to deliver up to 58 bcf of lng annually to the elba island lng terminal in savannah, georgia. the contract has a 17-year term with an option to extend for an additional five-year period. the agreement provides for the right to deliver lng under a put option with the operator of the facility and, under certain conditions, take redelivery of natural gas for onward sale to third parties. marathon atlantic basin integrated gas activity centers around the monetization of marathon gas reserves from the alba field. this proposed project would involve construction of an lng facility located on bioko island, equatorial guinea. lng is likely to be shipped to the united states or europe where it will be regasified and sold into the marketplace. approvals are required from the partners and government of equatorial guinea. marathon pacific basin integrated gas activity centers around construction of the tijuana regional energy center. the proposed project, to be located near tijuana, mexico, is an integrated complex planned to consist of a 750 mmcf per day lng offloading terminal and regasification plant, a 1,200-megawatt power generation plant, a 20-million gallon per day water desalination plant, wastewater treatment facilities and natural gas pipeline infrastructure. currently, marathon is proceeding with regulatory reviews and permits as required by federal authorities in mexico. assuming regulatory approval and the development of a successful commercial structure and financing plan, construction of the facilities is scheduled to begin in 2003 with expected startup in 2006. the above oerb discussion contains forward looking statements concerning the tijuana regional energy center. some factors, but not necessarily all factors that could adversely affect these expected results include unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants, identification of additional participants to reach optimum levels of participation, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, arranging sufficient project financing, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, competition with similar projects, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and government review and approval of the required permits. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. marathon competes with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of marathon competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to marathon. as a consequence, marathon may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and gas. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. marathon also competes in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, marathon believes it currently ranks eighth among u.s.-based petroleum corporations on the basis of 2001 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. marathon through map must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. map believes it ranks sixth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of crude oil refining capacity as of january 1, 2003. map competes in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products and believes it competes with about forty companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about eighty-seven companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; eleven refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum 19 table of contents products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately six hundred petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. marathon competes in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway and taco bell . marathon also competes in the travel center industry through its 50 percent ownership in ptc. marathon operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets it serves. generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001 ( reorganization agreement ), marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. marathon and its subsidiaries are continuing the energy business that comprised the marathon group of usx corporation. assumption of indebtedness and other obligations by united states steel prior to the separation, marathon managed most of its financial activities on a centralized, consolidated basis and, in its financial statements, attributed amounts that related primarily to the following items to the marathon group and the u.s. steel group on the basis of their cash flows for the applicable periods and the initial capital structure for each group: invested cash; short-term and long-term debt, including convertible debt, and related net interest and other financing costs; and preferred stock and related dividends. the following items, however, were specifically attributed to, and reflected in their entirety in the financial statements of, the group to which they related: leases; collateralized financings; indexed debt instruments; financial activities of consolidated entities that were not wholly owned subsidiaries; and transactions that related to securities convertible solely into common stock that tracked the performance of the marathon group or the u.s. steel group. these attributions were for accounting purposes only and did not reflect the legal ownership of cash or the legal obligations to pay and discharge debt or other obligations. in connection with the separation: united states steel and its subsidiaries incurred indebtedness to third parties and assumed various obligations from marathon in an aggregate amount approximately equal to all the net amounts attributed to the u. s. steel group immediately prior to the separation, both absolute and contingent, less the amount of a $900 million value transfer (the value transfer ); and marathon and its subsidiaries remained responsible for all the liabilities attributed to the marathon group, both absolute and contingent, plus the value transfer. 20 table of contents these arrangements required a post-separation cash settlement of $54 million between marathon and united states steel following the audit of the balance sheets for both the marathon group and the u. s. steel group as of december 31, 2001, in order to ensure that the value transfer was $900 million. at december 31, 2001, marathon had a $54 million settlement receivable from united states steel arising from the allocation of net debt and other financings at the time of the separation, which was paid on february 6, 2002. as a result of its assumption of various items of indebtedness and other obligations from its former parent entity in the holding company reorganization, marathon remained obligated after the separation for the following items of indebtedness and other obligations that were attributed to the u.s. steel group in accordance with the provisions of the reorganization agreement: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u. s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and other guarantees referred to under relationship between marathon and united states steel after the separation financial matters agreement below. as contemplated by the reorganization agreement, marathon and united states steel entered into a financial matters agreement to reflect united states steel agreement to assume and discharge all of marathon obligations referred to above. for additional information relating to the financial matters agreement, see relationship between marathon and united states steel after the separation financial matters agreement below. relationship between marathon and united states steel after the separation as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. thomas j. usher is chairman of the board of both companies, and, as of december 31, 2002, four of the nine remaining members of marathon board of directors are also directors of united states steel. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship subsequent to the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods prior to the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of those agreements. financial matters agreement marathon and united states steel have a financial matters agreement that provides for united states steel assumption of the obligations under marathon outstanding industrial revenue bonds, the sale-leaseback financing arrangement and the lease and guarantee obligations referred to above under the separation assumption of indebtedness and other obligations by united states steel on page 20. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all marathon principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under those industrial revenue bonds and lease and guarantee arrangements described above, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by marathon. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for marathon discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of, all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. $2 million of the industrial revenue bonds are scheduled to mature in the period extending through december 31, 2009. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase 21 table of contents options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. united states steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed lease obligations. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee marathon provided with respect to all united states steel obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. tax sharing agreement marathon and united states steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. provisions of this agreement include the following: for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before december 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between marathon and united states steel generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect prior to the separation; no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after december 31, 2001; and provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free transaction and limitations on post-separation activities that might jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation. under the general tax sharing principles in effect prior to the separation: the taxes payable by each of the marathon group and the u.s. steel group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return; and the u.s. steel group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable. in accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the separation, marathon made a preliminary settlement with united states steel of approximately $440 million as the net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended december 31, 2001 under the pre-separation tax sharing principles. the tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended prior to december 31, 2001. in the tax sharing agreement, each of marathon and united states steel promised the other party that it: would not, prior to january 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation; and 22 table of contents would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from the separation ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction. the prescribed actions and transactions include: the liquidation of marathon or united states steel; and the sale by marathon or united states steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business. in case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability. even if the separation otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code, the separation may become taxable to marathon under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either marathon or united states steel is acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the separation. for this purpose, a 50 percent or greater interest means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. to minimize this risk, both marathon and united states steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their equity structures that could cause the separation to be treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the internal revenue code may apply. if an acquisition occurs that results in the separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that acquisition transaction. although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the separation, each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the separation, is jointly and severally liable under the internal revenue code for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. marathon can provide no assurance, however, that united states steel will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement. license agreement marathon and united states steel have entered into a license agreement under which marathon granted to united states steel a non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide license to use the usx name and various trade secrets, know-how and intellectual property rights previously used in connection with the business of both companies. the license agreement provides that united states steel may use these rights solely in the conduct of its internal business. it also provides united states steel with the right to sublicense these rights to any of its subsidiaries. the license agreement provides for a perpetual term, so long as united states steel performs its obligations under the agreement. insurance assistance agreement marathon and united states steel have an insurance assistance agreement, which provides for: the division of responsibility for joint insurance arrangements; and the entitlement to insurance claims and the allocation of deductibles with respect to claims associated with pre-separation periods. under the insurance assistance agreement: marathon is entitled to all rights in and to all claims and is solely liable for the payment of uninsured retentions and deductibles arising out of or relating to pre-separation events or conditions exclusively associated with the business of the marathon group; 23 table of contents united states steel is entitled to all rights in and to all claims and is solely liable for the payment of uninsured retentions and deductibles arising out of or relating to pre-separation events or conditions exclusively associated with the business of the u. s. steel group; marathon is entitled to 65 percent and united states steel is entitled to 35 percent of all rights in and to all claims, and marathon and united states steel are liable on the same percentage basis for the payment of uninsured retentions and deductibles, arising out of or relating to pre-separation events or conditions and not related exclusively to either the marathon group or the u.s. steel group; and the cost of extended reporting insurance for pre-separation periods will be split between marathon and united states steel on a 65 percent-35 percent basis, respectively, if both companies elect to purchase the same extended reporting insurance. transition services agreement marathon and united states steel had a transition services agreement that governed the provision of the common corporate support services and inter-unit computer services until december 31, 2002. common corporate support services included services personnel at the former pittsburgh corporate headquarters historically provided prior to the separation. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2002 as of december 31, 2002, marathon has identified the following obligations totaling $705 million that arise from the separation of united states steel: $470 million of obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u. s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033 and related accrued interest payable of $5 million; $81 million of sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; $131 million of operating lease obligations, of which $78 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations of united states steel divested by marathon; a guarantee of united states steel $18 million contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent owned joint venture pro-tec coating company; and a guarantee of all obligations of united states steel as general partner of clairton 1314b partnership, l.p. to the limited partners, of which no outstanding unpaid amounts have been reported. of the total $705 million, obligations of $556 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on marathon consolidated balance sheet. the remaining $149 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. environmental matters marathon maintains a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the corporate governance and public policy committee of marathon board of directors. marathon health, environment and safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that marathon operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. the health, environment and safety management committee, which is comprised of officers of marathon, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. marathon has also formed an emergency management team, composed of senior management, which will oversee the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving marathon or any of its properties. marathon businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where marathon operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters. 24 table of contents these laws and their associated regulations are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on marathon for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for marathon acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable, due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for laws such as rcra and the caa have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies on page 43 and legal proceedings on page 27. marathon has incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures are not ultimately reflected in the prices of marathon products and services, marathon operating results will be adversely affected. marathon believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether or not it is engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil or refined products. during the past decade, map has received a number of notices of alleged violations of environmental laws from the u.s. environmental protection agency (the epa ) and state environmental agencies. in some cases, map has entered into consent decrees or orders that require it to pay fines or install pollution controls to settle its alleged liability. the most significant of these examples was map agreement to settle alleged violations of several environmental laws, including new source review regulations, with a consent decree in 2001. the consent decree requires map to complete certain agreed upon environmental control programs with total one-time expenditures of approximately $360 million over an eight-year period, with about $230 million remaining over the next six years. the impact of this settlement on on-going operating expenses is not expected to be material. the decree also requires map to perform supplemental environmental projects which will cost approximately $9 million. these supplemental environmental projects were undertaken as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations. in addition, map paid a $3.8 million penalty in 2001. map believes that this settlement will provide increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving emission reductions. air of particular significance to map are new epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in the manufacture of gasoline and diesel fuel. marathon estimates that map combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules could amount to approximately $900 million, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects, between 2002 and 2006. some factors that could potentially affect map gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits, operating and logistical considerations, further refinement of preliminary engineering studies and project scopes and unforeseen hazards. in july 1997, the epa promulgated more stringent revisions to the national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for ozone and particulate matter. these revisions had been vacated by the court of appeals for the district of columbia and remanded to the epa for further action. the epa sought review of the matter by the united states supreme court, and the supreme court heard the case in the fall of 2000. on february 27, 2001, the supreme court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the case to the epa to develop a reasonable interpretation of the non-attainment implementation provisions insofar as they relate to the revised ozone naaqs. on remand, the epa stood firm on the new eight-hour ozone standard and recently stated its intention to promulgate a final rule by december 2003, but another part of this case remains with the d.c. circuit court of appeals for further determination. additionally, in 1998, the epa published a nitrogen oxide ( nox ) state implementation plan ( sip ) call, which would require approximately 20 states, including many states where marathon has operations, to revise their sips to reduce nox emissions. in december 1999, the epa granted a petition from several northeastern states requesting that stricter nox standards be required of upwind midwestern states, including several states where marathon has refineries. the impact of the revised naaqs and nox standards could be significant to marathon, but the potential financial effects cannot be reasonably estimated until the epa takes further action on the revised ozone naaqs (along with any further judicial review) and the states, as necessary, develop and implement revised sips in response to the revised naaqs and nox standards. 25 table of contents water marathon maintains numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and has implemented systems to oversee its compliance efforts. in addition, marathon is regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. as of december 31, 2002, all of the barges used in map river transportation operations meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. marathon operates facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which marathon operates have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. marathon has implemented emergency oil response plans for all of its components and facilities covered by opa-90. solid waste marathon continues to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in its operations. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. since the epa has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of rcra and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the implementing regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance with this statute cannot be accurately estimated. in addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. remediation marathon owns or operates certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. marathon obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which it operates. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement fund once the applicable deductible has been satisfied. accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. as a general rule, marathon and ashland retained responsibility for certain remediation costs arising out of the prior ownership and operation of businesses transferred to map. such continuing responsibility, in certain situations, may be subject to threshold or sunset agreements, which gradually diminish this responsibility over time. properties the location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of marathon have been described previously. except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a

made specifically for the purpose of this document. the properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim. 26 table of

legal proceedings marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. certain of these matters are included below in this discussion. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. however, management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably. natural gas royalty litigation marathon was served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and indian lessees violated the false claims act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. the first case, u.s. ex rel jack j. grynberg v. alaska pipeline co., et al . is primarily a gas measurement case, and the second case, u.s. ex rel harrold e. wright v. agip petroleum co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. these cases assert that false claims have been filed by lessees and that penalties, damages and interest total more than $25 billion. the department of justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including marathon. in july 2001, the court in the consolidated proceeding denied defendants motions to dismiss. the matters are in the discovery phase and marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases. cajun express arbitration in september, 2002, marathon settled its pending arbitration with transocean sedco forex inc. arising from marathon cancellation of the cajun express rig contract on july 5, 2001. transocean july 19, 2001 demand for arbitration sought net lost revenue of an unspecified amount. the contract may have generated $90 million in gross revenues over the remainder of the 18 month period. the settlement terms included payment of a portion of the disputed claim resulting in a $9 million after-tax loss. 27 table of contents environmental proceedings the following is a summary of proceedings involving marathon that were pending or contemplated as of december 31, 2002, under federal and state environmental laws. except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management belief set forth in the first paragraph under item 3. legal proceedings above takes such matters into account. claims under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ( cercla ) and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. potentially responsible parties ( prps ) for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. liability is strict and can be joint and several. because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with cercla. projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. at december 31, 2002, marathon had been identified as a prp at a total of 11 cercla waste sites. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with all but one of these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000. marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under $4 million. in addition, there are four sites where marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. there are also 82 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. of these sites, 10 were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland which have retained liability for all costs associated with remediation. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 12 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 28 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site, 13 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site and 6 sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site. of the 6 sites, only 1 site as described in the following paragraph has future costs that are estimated to exceed $5 million. there are 13 sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs. there is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the michigan department of environmental quality at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near muskegon, michigan. during the next 10 to 20 years, marathon anticipates spending less than $7 million at this site. expenditures in 2003 are expected to be approximately $500,000. additionally, negotiations are taking place with the michigan department of environmental quality to eventually perform a risk-based closure on this site. on december 3, 2001, illinois epa ( iepa ) issued a nov to map arising out of the sinking of a floating roof on a storage tank at a martinsville, illinois facility. a storm and heavy rainfall caused the floating roof to sink. map believes it may have an emergency or malfunction defense. this matter has been referred to the illinois attorney general office for enforcement proceedings. in march, 2002, map attended a meeting with the illinois epa concerning map self reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to some storage tanks at map robinson, illinois facility. in late april, map submitted to iepa a comprehensive settlement proposal which was rejected by iepa. we have had subsequent discussions with iepa and the illinois attorney general office and anticipate additional meetings and discussions in the coming months. 28 table of contents the kentucky natural resources and environmental cabinet (the cabinet) issued the map catlettsburg, kentucky refinery a notice of violation regarding the tank 845 rupture which occurred in november of 1999. the tank rupture caused the tank contents to be released onto the ground and adjoining retention area. map has been involved in discussions with the cabinet to resolve this matter through an agreed administrative order. map is optimistic that this matter may be resolved in 2003 and the civil penalty will be in the range of $90,000 to $120,000. in 2000, the kentucky natural resources and environmental cabinet sent marathon ashland pipe line llc a nov seeking a civil penalty associated with a pipeline spill earlier that year in winchester, kentucky. map has settled this nov in the form of an agreed-to administrative order which was finalized and entered in january 2002 and required payment of a $170,000 penalty and reimbursement of past response costs up to $131,000. map entered into a consent decree in july of 2002 with the state of ohio regarding air compliance matters at its canton refinery during both ashland and map term of ownership and operation. the consent decree required $350,000 in payments which included a penalty of $216,500, several supplemental environmental projects and the funding of a community notification system. the consent decree is being implemented. in july, 2002, marathon received a notice of enforcement from the state of texas for alleged excess air emissions from its yates gas plant and production operations on its kloh lease. the notices did not compute a penalty or fine for these pending enforcement actions. item 4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders not applicable. part ii item 5. market for registrant common equity and related stockholder matters the principal market on which the company common stock is traded is the new york stock exchange. information concerning the high and low sales prices for the common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in selected quarterly financial data (unaudited) on page f-37. as of january 31, 2003, there were 64,857 registered holders of marathon common stock. the board of directors intends to declare and pay dividends on marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of marathon oil corporation, although it has no obligation under delaware law or the restated certificate of incorporation to do so. in determining its dividend policy with respect to marathon common stock, the board will rely on the financial statements of marathon. dividends on marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of marathon. on january 29, 2003, marathon amended the rights agreement, dated as of september 28, 1999, as amended, between marathon and national city bank, as successor rights agent. the rights agreement was amended so that the rights to purchase series a junior preferred stock expired on january 31, 2003, more than six years earlier than initially specified in the plan. item 6. selected financial data see page f-46. 29 table of contents item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marathon oil corporation ( marathon ), formerly usx corporation, is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through its 62 percent owned subsidiary, marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ); and other energy related businesses. the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements. prior to december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon energy business, and usx u. s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon steel business. on december 31, 2001, usx corporation disposed of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis (the separation ) and changed its name to marathon oil corporation. certain sections of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of marathon. these statements typically contain words such as anticipates , believes , estimates , expects , targets or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. for additional risk factors affecting the businesses of marathon, see disclosures regarding forward-looking statements on page 2. unless specifically noted, amounts for map do not reflect any reduction for the 38 percent interest held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). management discussion and analysis of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical a) if such estimates require assumptions about matters that are dependent on events remote in time that may or may not occur, are not capable of being readily calculated from generally accepted methodologies, or cannot be derived with some degree of precision from available data and b) if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have had a material impact on the presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas marathon uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affects, among other things, whether or not certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties and the expected future taxable income available to realize the value of deferred tax assets, which are discussed further below, rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas. marathon estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. the actual recoverability of hydrocarbons can vary from estimated amounts. due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas are subject to potentially substantial changes, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, economic and political conditions change. 30 table of contents expected future cash flows generated by certain oil and gas producing properties marathon must estimate the expected future cash flows to be generated by its oil and gas producing properties in order to evaluate the possible need to impair the carrying value of those properties. an impairment of any one of marathon three largest fields could have a material impact on the presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. those fields the alba field offshore equatorial guinea, the yates field in west texas and the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom comprise approximately 46 percent of marathon total proved oil and gas reserves. the expected future cash flows from these properties require assumptions about matters such as the prevailing level of future oil and gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of oil and gas, expected field performance and the political environment in the host country. long-lived assets held and used in operations must be impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value. recoverability of the carrying value is determined by comparison with the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated by those assets. as of december 31, 2002, no impairment in the value of the alba field or the brae area complex was indicated. marathon interest in the yates field is held through its investment in mkm partners l.p., which is accounted for under the equity method. equity method investments must be impaired when a loss in value occurs that is other than a temporary decline. as of december 31, 2002, no impairment in the value of mkm partners l.p. was indicated. expected future taxable income marathon must estimate its expected future taxable income in order to assess the realizability of its deferred income tax assets. as of december 31, 2002, marathon reported net deferred tax assets of $1.103 billion, which represented gross assets of $1.585 billion net of valuation allowances of $482 million. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in marathon internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. in determining its overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, marathon considers proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves related to its existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in the judgment of marathon management, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance, marathon considers the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. additionally, marathon must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if management has the ability to implement these strategies and the expectation of implementing these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to marathon relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered annually to give effect to changes in marathon portfolio of producing properties and in its tax profile. marathon deferred tax assets include $393 million relating to norwegian net operating loss carryforwards ( nols ). marathon has established a valuation allowance of $363 million against these nols. currently marathon generates income from the heimdal and vale fields in the norwegian north sea. marathon acquired additional interests in norway in 2001 and 2002. these interests currently have no proved reserves and generate no income, although some interests hold undeveloped discoveries. to the extent that these newly acquired interests demonstrate the capability to generate future taxable income, marathon may be able to release some or all of its $363 million valuation allowance in future periods. net realizable value of receivables from united states steel as described further in management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on page 41, marathon remains obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. as of december 31, 2002, 31 table of contents marathon has reported receivables from united states steel of $556 million, representing the amount of principal and accrued interest on marathon debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment. marathon must assess the realizability of these receivables, based on its expectations of united states steel ability to satisfy its obligations. in order to make this assessment, marathon must rely on public information about united states steel. as of december 31, 2002, marathon has judged the entire receivable to be realizable. marathon may continue to be exposed to the risk of nonpayment by united states steel on a significant portion of this receivable until december 31, 2011. of the $556 million, $469 million, or 84 percent, relates to industrial revenue bonds that are due in 2011 or later. the financial matters agreement between marathon and united states steel provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, which is december 31, 2011, united states steel will provide for marathon discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. as of december 31, 2002, marathon cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (which includes debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment) was 44.5 percent. the assessment of marathon liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by expectations concerning united states steel ability to satisfy its obligations. for instance, if the debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment were excluded from the computation, marathon cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of december 31, 2002 would have been approximately 41 percent. on the other hand, if the receivable from united states steel had been written off as unrealizable, the cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of december 31, 2002 would have been approximately 46 percent. (if united states steel were not able to satisfy its obligations, other adjustments in addition to the write-off of the receivable may be necessary.) net realizable value of inventories generally accepted accounting principles require that inventories be carried at lower of cost or market. accordingly, when the cost basis of marathon inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products exceed market value, marathon establishes an inventory market valuation ( imv ) reserve to reduce the cost basis of its inventories to net realizable value. adjustments to the imv reserve result in noncash charges or credits to income from operations. when marathon oil company was acquired in march 1982, prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were at historically high levels. in applying the purchase method of accounting, inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were revalued by reference to current prices at the time of acquisition. this became the new lifo cost basis of the inventories. when marathon acquired the crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories associated with ashland rm&amp;t operations on january 1, 1998, marathon established a new lifo cost basis for those inventories. the acquisition cost of these inventories lowered the overall average cost of the combined rm&amp;t inventories. as a result, the price threshold at which an imv reserve will be recorded was also lowered. since the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products do not correlate perfectly, there is no absolute price threshold below which an imv adjustment will be recognized. however, generally, marathon will establish an imv reserve when crude oil prices fall below $21 per barrel. as of december 31, 2002, no imv reserve had been recognized. contingent liabilities marathon accrues contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. these contingent obligations are assessed regularly by marathon in-house legal counsel. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies on page 43. pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for these benefits involves assumptions related to the appropriate discount rate for measuring the present value of plan obligations, the expected rates of return on plan assets, the rate of future increases in 32 table of contents compensation levels and health care cost projections. marathon develops its demographics and utilizes the work of outside actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. effective december 31, 2002, marathon revised the actuarial assumptions related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the discount rate was lowered from 7 percent to 6.5 percent. the expected rate of return on plan assets was reduced from 9.5 percent to 9 percent. the annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered health care benefits was increased from 7.5 percent to 10 percent. based on the actual 2002 results for the various plans and the revisions to the underlying assumptions, marathon recognized an unfavorable additional minimum pension adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) of $33 million at december 31, 2002. marathon expects that pension and other postretirement plan expense in 2003 will increase approximately $75 million from 2002 levels, of which approximately $45 million relates to map. map is required to fund a cash contribution of approximately $35 million to its pension plan in the third quarter of 2003. as of december 31, 2002, the allocation of pension plan assets approximated 75 percent in equity securities, 22 percent in bonds and 3 percent in other investments, which is consistent with the expectations underlying the rate-of-return assumptions. the average rate-of-return on marathon plan assets achieved by its investment advisor has historically exceeded the current expected rate-of-return. management discussion and analysis of income and operations revenues for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 exploration &amp;

of $12 million in 2001 from 2000. the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower volumes, lower derivative gains and higher dry well expense, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon prices. the increase in 2001 was primarily due to gains from derivative activities and higher natural gas volumes and prices, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon prices. international e&amp;p income increased by $49 million in 2002 from 2001 following a decrease of $123 million in 2001 from 2000. the increase in 2002 was a result of higher production volumes and higher derivative gains partially offset by lower natural gas prices. the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon prices, increased depletion expense due primarily to 2000 reserve reductions and lower natural gas volumes, partially offset by increased natural gas prices, lower dry well expense, and lower foreign royalty and geophysical contract expenditures. rm&amp;t segment income decreased by $1.558 billion in 2002 from 2001 following an increase of $641 million in 2001 from 2000. in 2002, the refining and wholesale marketing margin was severely compressed as crude oil costs increased while average refined product prices decreased. gains on the sale of ssa stores included in segment income were $37 million, $23 million, and $7 million for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. the increase in 2001 was primarily due to a higher refining and wholesale marketing margin partially offset by lower ssa gasoline and distillate sales volumes and increased refining and wholesale marketing transportation expense. 35 table of contents oerb segment income increased by $16 million in 2002 following an increase of $19 million in 2001 from 2000. the increase in 2002 reflected a favorable effect of $26 million from increased margins in gas marketing activities and mark-to-market valuation changes in associated derivatives and earnings of $11 million from marathon equity investment in the equatorial guinea methanol plant, partially offset by predevelopment costs associated with emerging integrated gas projects. the increase in 2001 was primarily a result of higher crude oil purchase and resale activity accompanied by increased margins and losses from derivative activities recorded in 2000. items not allocated to segments: administrative expenses increased by $7 million in 2002 following an increase of $33 million in 2001 from 2000. unallocated administrative expenses associated with corporate activities are not included in segment income. the increase in 2002 primarily reflected increased state franchise tax expense. the increase in 2001 was primarily due to the portion of costs related to the development of an enterprise-wide software application that could not be capitalized and costs resulting from activities related to the separation. imv reserve adjustment in 2002, the imv reserve adjustment resulted in a credit to income from operations of $72 million. the favorable 2002 imv reserve adjustment was primarily due to an increase in crude oil and refined petroleum product prices, reversing the 2001 imv charge to income that resulted from a decrease in crude oil and refined petroleum product prices at december 31, 2001. for additional information on this adjustment, see management discussion and analysis of critical accounting estimates net realizable value of inventories on page 32. gain (loss) on ownership change in map reflects the effects of contributions to map of certain environmental capital expenditures funded by marathon and ashland. in accordance with map limited liability company agreement, in certain instances, environmental capital expenditures are funded by the original owner of the assets, but no change in ownership interest may result from these contributions. an excess of ashland funded improvements over marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of marathon funded improvements over ashland funded improvements results in a net loss. other items not allocated to segments certain nonoperating or infrequently occurring items are not allocated to segments. such items in the aggregate had a net favorable effect on income from operations of $9 million in 2002 and net unfavorable effects of $176 million in 2001 and $1.074 billion in 2000. a loss on the sale of certain canadian assets of $221 million was included in 2001 and a charge related to the formation of mkm of $931 million was included in 2000. net interest and other financial costs increased by $95 million in 2002 from 2001, following a decrease of $63 million in 2001 from 2000. the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher average debt levels resulting from acquisitions and the separation. the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower average debt levels and increased capitalized interest on rm&amp;t projects. minority interest in income of map , which represents ashland 38 percent ownership interest, decreased by $531 million in 2002 from 2001, following an increase of $206 million in 2001 from 2000. map income was significantly lower in 2002 compared to 2001 as discussed above in the rm&amp;t segment. map income was higher in 2001 compared to 2000 as discussed above in the rm&amp;t segment. provision for income taxes was $389 million in 2002, compared with $759 million in 2001 and $476 million in 2000. the 2002 provision included a one-time, deferred tax charge of $61 million as a result of the enactment of a supplemental tax in the united kingdom ( u.k. ). the 2000 provision included a one-time, noncash deferred tax charge of $235 million as a result of the change in the amount, timing and nature of expected future foreign source income due to the exchange of marathon interest in sakhalin energy for other oil and gas producing interests. 36 table of contents the following is an analysis of the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2002 2001 2000 statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % effects of foreign operations (a) 5.4 (1.5 ) 19.5 state and local income taxes after federal income tax effects 3.9 3.2 0.6 other federal tax effects (2.3 ) (0.2 ) (2.0 ) effective tax rate 42.0 % 36.5 % 53.1 % (a) the deferred tax effect related to the enactment of a supplemental tax in the u.k. increased the effective tax rate 6.4 percent in 2002. the deferred tax effect resulting from the exchange of marathon interest in sakhalin energy increased the effective tax rate 26.2 percent in 2000. the release of a foreign valuation allowance decreased the effective tax rate 3.3 percent in 2000. discontinued operations in 2001 represents the net loss attributed to steel stock, adjusted for certain corporate administrative expenses and interest expense (net of income tax effects). the loss on disposition of united states steel corporation represents the excess of the net investment in united states steel over the aggregate fair market value of the outstanding shares of the steel stock at the time of the separation. extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt in 2002 was attributable to the retirement of $337 million aggregate principal amount of debt resulting in an extraordinary loss of $33 million (net of tax of $20 million). cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $13 million, net of a tax provision of $7 million in 2002 represents the adoption of recently issued interpretations by the fasb of sfas no. 133 in which marathon must recognize in income the effect of changes in the fair value of two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the united kingdom. the $8 million loss, net of a tax benefit of $5 million, in 2001 was an unfavorable transition adjustment related to the initial adoption of sfas no. 133. net income increased by $359 million in 2002 from 2001, following a decrease of $254 million in 2001 from 2000, primarily reflecting the factors discussed above. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity financial condition current assets increased $68 million from year-end 2001, primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. the increase in receivables was mainly due to higher year-end commodity prices partially offset by a decrease in derivative assets and the increase in inventories was primarily the result of higher prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products that reversed 2001 imv reserve. cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2001 included amounts in preparation for the acquisition of equatorial guinea interests and the repayment of preferred securities in january 2002. current liabilities increased $191 million from year-end 2001, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued taxes partially offset by the repayment of preferred securities. the increase in accounts payable was due to higher priced year-end crude purchases at map. investments and long-term receivables increased $558 million from year-end 2001, primarily due to the acquisitions of the equatorial guinea interests. 37 table of contents net property, plant and equipment increased $838 million from year-end 2001, primarily due to the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests. net property, plant and equipment for each of the last two years is summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2002 2001 e&amp;p domestic $ 2,720 $ 2,839 international 3,186 2,471 total e&amp;p 5,906 5,310 rm&amp;t 4,234 4,010 oerb 67 55 corporate 183 177 total $ 10,390 $ 9,552 goodwill increased $186 million from year-end 2001. the increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests. significant factors that resulted in the recognition of goodwill in these acquisitions include: the ability to acquire an established business with an assembled workforce and a proven track record and a strategic acquisition in a core geographic area. intangibles increased $58 million from year-end 2001 primarily due to the acquisition of the contractual right to deliver to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal. long-term debt at december 31, 2002 was $4.410 billion, an increase of $978 million from year-end 2001. public debt totaling $1.850 billion was issued to fund the purchase price and associated costs of the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests, to refinance $337 million aggregate principal amount of existing debt, to reduce outstanding commercial paper and for other general corporate purposes. cash flows net cash provided from operating activities (for continuing operations) totaled $2.405 billion in 2002, compared with $2.919 billion in 2001 and $3.146 billion in 2000. the decrease in 2002 mainly reflects the effects of lower refined product margins and lower prices for natural gas. net cash provided from operating activities (for discontinued operations) totaled $717 million in 2001, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $615 million in 2000. this activity is related to the business of united states steel. net cash used in investing activities (for continuing operations) totaled $2.666 billion in 2002, compared with $1.999 billion in 2001 and $923 million in 2000. the increase in 2002 primarily resulted from the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests and decreased asset disposals, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. proceeds of $152 million from the disposal of assets in 2002 were primarily from the sale of ssa stores and the sale of san juan basin assets. proceeds from the disposal of assets in 2001 of $296 million were primarily from the sale of certain canadian assets, ssa stores, and various domestic producing properties. proceeds in 2000 were mainly from the sakhalin exchange, the disposition of marathon interest in the angus/stellaria development in the gulf of mexico, the sale of non-core ssa stores and the sale of other domestic production properties. capital expenditures for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 e&amp;p (a) domestic $ 416 $ 537 $ 513 international 457 400 226 total e&amp;p 873 937 739 rm&amp;t 621 591 656 oerb 49 4 5 corporate 31 107 25 total $ 1,574 $ 1,639 $ 1,425 (a) amounts exclude the acquisitions of the equatorial guinea interests in 2002 and pennaco in 2001. 38 table of contents capital expenditures in 2002 totaled $1.574 billion excluding the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests, compared with $1.639 billion in 2001. the $65 million decrease mainly reflected decreased spending in the e&amp;p segment offset by increased spending in the rm&amp;t segment. the decrease in the e&amp;p segment was primarily due to the drilling of fewer gas wells in the united states in 2002 partially offset by higher capital expenditures for completion of a pipeline in gabon, for a pipeline construction contract in ireland and for development expenditures in equatorial guinea. the increase in the rm&amp;t segment was attributable to increased spending on the multi-year integrated investment program at map catlettsburg refinery and construction of the cardinal products pipeline in 2002, partially offset by lower capital expenditures for ssa retail outlets and completion of the garyville coker construction in 2001. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, including marathon proportionate share of equity investees costs incurred, were $404 million, $365 million, and $316 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2002, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2003 through 2005 are projected to be $464 million, $139 million, and $67 million, respectively. net cash used in investing activities (for discontinued operations) totaled $245 million in 2001, compared with $270 million in 2000. this activity related to the business of united states steel. net cash provided by financing activities totaled $88 million in 2002, compared with net cash used of $1.290 billion in 2001 and $911 million in 2000. the increase was primarily due to financing associated with the two acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests of approximately $1.2 billion. this was partially offset by the early extinguishment of $337 million aggregate principal amount of debt and the $295 million repayment of preferred securities that became redeemable or were converted to a right to receive cash upon the separation. in early january 2002, marathon paid $185 million to retire the 6.75% convertible quarterly income preferred securities and $110 million to retire the 6.50% cumulative convertible preferred stock. additionally, distributions to minority shareholder of map were $176 million in 2002, compared to $577 million in 2001 and $420 million in 2000. the cash used in 2001 primarily reflects distributions to minority shareholder of map, dividends paid and the redemption of the 8.75 percent cumulative monthly income preferred shares. the cash used in 2000 primarily reflects distributions to minority shareholder of map, dividends paid and a stock repurchase program for marathon. derivative instruments see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page 51, for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. liquidity and capital resources marathon main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. marathon ability to access the debt capital market is supported by its investment grade credit ratings. because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to marathon, including internally generated cash flow, marathon management believes that its short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities for the years 2003, 2004, and 2005, and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. marathon senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor corporation, moody investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+, baa1, and bbb+, respectively. marathon has a committed $1.354 billion long-term revolving credit facility that terminates in november 2005 and a committed $574 million 364-day revolving credit facility that terminates in november 2003. at december 31, 2002, there were no borrowings against these facilities. in april 2002, marathon initiated a $1.350 billion commercial paper program that is backed by the long-term revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2002, $100 million of commercial paper was outstanding. additionally, at december 31, 2002, marathon had other uncommitted short-term lines of credit totaling $200 million, of which no amounts were drawn. map currently has a committed $350 million short-term revolving credit facility which expires in july 2003. additionally, map has a $190 million revolving credit agreement with ashland that expires in march 2003. as of december 31, 2002, map did not have any borrowings against these facilities. marathon and ashland are investigating other alternatives to provide other liquidity in to map. 39 table of contents in 2002, marathon filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission registering $2.7 billion aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities and/or other securities, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for other equity or debt securities. as of december 31, 2002, no securities had been offered under this shelf registration statement. in 2002, marathon issued notes of $1.450 billion as follows: $450 million due 2012, $550 million due 2032 and $450 million due 2007, bearing interest at 6.125 percent, 6.8 percent and 5.375 percent, respectively. additionally, marathon global funding corporation, a 100 percent owned consolidated finance subsidiary of marathon, issued notes of $400 million due 2012, bearing interest at 6.0 percent. marathon has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of marathon global funding. marathon used the net proceeds of these borrowings to fund the purchase price and associated costs of the acquisition of interests in equatorial guinea, to refinance existing debt, to reduce outstanding commercial paper and for other general corporate purposes. the debt repurchased and retired early had average terms to maturity of between two and 21 years bearing interest at rates ranging from 8.125 percent to 9.375 percent per year, or a weighted average of 9.04 percent per year. the retirement of $337 million aggregate principal amount of debt in 2002 resulted in an extraordinary loss of $33 million (net of tax of $20 million). the table below provides aggregated information on marathon obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31, 2002: summary of contractual cash obligations (dollars in millions) total 2003 2004- 2005 2006- 2007 later years short and long-term debt (a) $ 4,485 $ 156 $ 413 $ 752 $ 3,164 sale-leaseback financing (includes

assumed certain debt and lease obligations. such amounts have been included in the above table to reflect the fact that marathon remains primarily liable. (b) marathon is a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with a natural gas transmission company. this agreement is used by the natural gas transmission company to secure its financing. this arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of marathon guarantees. (c) the majority of 2003 contractual obligations to purchase crude oil, refinery feedstock and refined products relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of the year. (d) marathon has acquired the right to deliver to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal 58 bcf of natural gas per year. the agreement primary term ends in 2018. pursuant to this agreement, marathon has also bound itself to a commitment to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the lng re-gasification terminal. (e) services and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and consulting services. (f) commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs within contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are subject to immediate expense, such as geological and geophysical costs. (g) includes $719 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. for additional information, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel on page 42. 40 table of contents contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded from the above table. these include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors. marathon management opinion concerning liquidity and marathon ability to avail itself in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. to the extent that this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include the performance of marathon (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of marathon outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. off balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact marathon liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements may not be currently recorded as liabilities. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of marathon business purposes, marathon is not dependent on these arrangements to meet its liquidity and capital resources; nor is management aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or capital resources. one off-balance sheet arrangement in which marathon participants is in the leasing of two tankers to transport lng. if marathon were to purchase such assets rather than lease them, it would assume a liability for the financing. in 2002, marathon share of operating lease payments under this arrangement was $5 million. for additional details on this arrangement, refer to note 24 to the consolidated financial statements on page f-33. marathon has also provided various forms of guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates, united states steel and certain lease contracts. these arrangements are described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements on page f-34. marathon also is a party to agreements that would require marathon to purchase, under certain circumstances, its joint venture partners interests in map and in pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ). these put/call agreements are described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. nonrecourse indebtedness of investees certain equity investees of marathon have incurred indebtedness that marathon does not support through guarantees or otherwise. if marathon were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata basis, its share would have been approximately $331 million as of december 31, 2002. of this amount, $159 million relates to ptc. additionally, ptc expects to incur additional indebtedness in connection with its recent acquisition of 60 retail travel centers, of which marathon pro rata share would be $84 million. in the event of default by any of these equity investees, marathon has no obligation to support the debt. obligations associated with the separation of united states steel marathon remains obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. in the event of united states steel failure to satisfy these obligations, marathon would become responsible for repayment. as of december 31, 2002, marathon has identified the following obligations totaling $705 million that have been assumed by united states steel: $470 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $5 million at december 31, 2002. $81 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2002. $131 million of operating lease obligations, of which $78 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee of united states steel $18 million contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent owned joint venture pro-tec coating company. 41 table of contents a guarantee of all obligations of united states steel as general partner of clairton 1314b partnership, l.p. to the limited partners. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. for further discussion of the clairton 1314b guarantee, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $705 million, obligations of $556 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on marathon consolidated balance sheet (current portion $9 million; long-term portion $547 million). the remaining $149 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during taxable periods ended on or prior to december 31, 2001, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for those periods. marathon and united states steel have entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended on or prior to december 31, 2001. to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes indemnification provisions. as of december 31, 2001, marathon had identified obligations totaling $704 million that had been assumed by united states steel. also, as of december 31, 2001, marathon had a $54 million settlement receivable from united states steel arising from the allocation of net debt and other financings at the time of the separation, which was paid on february 6, 2002. during 2002, increases resulting from the extension of certain operating lease obligations were partially offset by decreases in obligations assumed by united states steel resulting from scheduled payments. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases. the table below provides aggregated information on the portion of marathon obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by united states steel as of december 31, 2002: summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel (dollars in millions) total 2003 2004- 2005 2006- 2007 later years contractual obligations assumed by united states steel long-term debt $ 470 $ $ $ $ 470 sale-leaseback financing (includes imputed interest) 118 11 22 31 54 operating lease obligations 53 5 14 16 18 operating lease obligations under sublease 78 18 25 9 26 total contractual obligations assumed by united states steel $ 719 $ 34 $ 61 $ 56 $ 568 united states steel reported in its form 10-q for the quarterly period ended september 30, 2002, that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. however, united states steel management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. if there is a prolonged delay in the recovery of the manufacturing sector of the u.s. economy, united states steel believes that it can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending, sale of non-strategic assets and other cash conservation measures. on january 28, 2003, united states steel announced, in a press release reporting 2002 fourth quarter and full-year results, that available sources of liquidity at the end of 2002 were $1.03 billion. in february 2003, united states steel issued mandatory convertible preferred shares for net proceeds of approximately $242 million. united states steel has announced its interest in acquiring the assets of bankrupt national steel corporation. 42 table of contents management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies marathon has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of marathon products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. marathon believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether or not it is engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. marathon environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were (a) : (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 capital $ 148 $ 110 $ 73 compliance operating &amp; maintenance 187 199 176 remediation (b) 44 34 30 total $ 379 $ 343 $ 279 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines and include 100 percent of map. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. marathon environmental capital expenditures accounted for nine percent of total capital expenditures in 2002, seven percent in 2001, and five percent in 2000. during 2000 through 2002, compliance expenditures represented one percent of marathon total operating costs. remediation spending during this period was primarily related to retail marketing outlets that incur ongoing clean-up costs for soil and groundwater contamination associated with underground storage tanks and piping. marathon has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party ( prp ) at 11 waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ( cercla ) as of december 31, 2002. in addition, there are four sites where marathon has received information requests or other indications that marathon may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. at many of these sites, marathon is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well as marathon share thereof, is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies. there are also 82 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. of these sites, 10 were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland for which ashland has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation. marathon accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase marathon environmental costs, may arise in the future. marathon intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation, it probably is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed. however, based on presently available information, and existing laws and regulations as currently implemented, marathon does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures (including operating and maintenance and remediation) will materially increase in 2003. 43 table of contents marathon environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $173 million in 2003. predictions beyond 2003 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based upon currently identified projects, marathon anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $300 million in 2004; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. new tier ii gasoline rules, which were finalized by the epa in february 2000, and the diesel fuel rules, which were finalized in january 2001, require substantially reduced sulfur levels for gasoline and diesel. the combined capital costs to achieve compliance with the gasoline and diesel regulations could amount to approximately $900 million, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects, between 2002 and 2006. this is a forward-looking statement. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits, operating and logistical considerations, further refinement of preliminary engineering studies and project scopes, and unforeseen hazards. in march 2002, map attended a meeting with the illinois epa concerning map self reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to some storage tanks at map robinson, illinois facility. in late april, map submitted to iepa a comprehensive settlement proposal that was rejected by iepa. map has had subsequent discussions with iepa and the illinois attorney general office and anticipates additional meetings and discussions in the coming months. during 2001 map entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act ( caa ) and other violations with the epa covering all of map refineries. the settlement committed map to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to map refineries over approximately an eight-year period. the total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately $360 million over the eight year period, with about $230 million remaining over the next six years. the impact of the settlement on on-going operating expenses is expected to be immaterial. in addition, map has nearly completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations, at a cost of $9 million. map believes that this settlement will provide map with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions. map entered into a consent decree in july of 2002 with the state of ohio regarding air compliance matters at its canton refinery during both ashland and map term of ownership and operation. the consent decree required $350,000 in payments which included a penalty of $216,500, several supplemental environmental projects and the funding of a community notification system. the consent decree is being implemented. map used mtbe as an octane enhancer and oxygenate in reformulated gasoline to comply with applicable laws for many years. the maximum amount of mtbe in gasoline is 15 percent by volume. approximately 7 percent of map 2001 gasoline production contained mtbe. map had three mtbe units at its refineries in detroit, robinson and catlettsburg with a combined book value of approximately $10 million at december 31, 2001. because several states in map marketing area have passed laws banning mtbe as a gasoline component in the future, map decided in the first quarter of 2002 to begin to phase out production of mtbe and to reduce the remaining estimated useful life of the mtbe units. mtbe production was discontinued in october 2002, by which time the mtbe units were fully depreciated. marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements on page f-34 for a discussion of certain of these matters. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to marathon. however, management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to marathon. other contingencies map has instituted a number of process and facility modifications at its catlettsburg refinery to correct the operating conditions that led to a product quality issue in 2002. map has been working with some regional gasoline jobbers and dealers since august 2002 to remedy certain product quality issues in gasoline produced at 44 table of contents this refinery. as a part of its response to the situation, map has inspected a large number of retail, terminal and transportation facilities, and has systematically cleaned facilities and repaired consumer vehicles that may have been impacted. credit risk marathon is exposed to credit risk in the form of possible nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy related industries. to mitigate this risk, the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to ongoing review. when deemed appropriate, marathon requires prepayment, letters of credit, netting agreements or other security to reduce its exposure. marathon has taken steps throughout 2002 to manage its exposures to those energy merchant firms whose creditworthiness has deteriorated. where appropriate, marathon has either obtained security to support its continued sales or has ceased business activity with the affected entities. marathon has significant exposures to united states steel arising from the separation. those exposures are discussed in obligations associated with the separation of united states steel . 45 table of contents outlook exploration and production the outlook regarding marathon upstream revenues and income is largely dependent upon future prices and volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been affected by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in worldwide economic activity and political developments in the world major oil and gas producing and consuming areas. any significant decline in prices could have a material adverse effect on marathon results of operations. a prolonged decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of crude oil and natural gas reserves that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development. marathon estimates its 2003 and 2004 production will average 390,000 to 395,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ( boepd ), excluding the effect of any acquisitions or dispositions. this compares to 2002 production of slightly over 412,000 boepd. major upstream activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include: gulf of mexico, where marathon plans to participate in three or four deepwater exploration wells during 2003; norway, where marathon has interests in nine licenses in the norwegian sector of the north sea and plans to drill three or four exploration wells during 2003 and participate in two development wells in the byggve skirne fields; alaska, where marathon had a natural gas discovery on the ninilchik unit on the kenai peninsula with additional drilling planned in 2003; angola, where marathon participated in the drilling of the successful plutao exploration well on block 31, is currently participating in the testing of the gindungo well on block 32 and plans to participate in three or four additional exploration wells in this area during 2003; eastern canada, where marathon drilled the annapolis g-24 gas discovery well and expects to drill one additional exploration well in the annapolis block during 2003; equatorial guinea, where government approved expansion plans are underway to increase liquid and natural gas production and drill three or four exploration wells in 2003; foinaven, in the atlantic margin offshore the u.k., where marathon plans to drill three or four developmental wells, all of which are permitted; braemar, in the u.k. north sea, where a subsea development well will be tied back to the east brae platform; ireland, where the greensand subsea well will be drilled and tied back to the kinsale head facilities; and wyoming powder river basin, where marathon plans to drill 400 to 500 coal bed natural gas wells in 2003, all of which are permitted. in equatorial guinea, marathon secured government approval of the alba field phase 2b liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) expansion project, complementing the phase 2a offshore and condensate expansion project. upon completion of phase 2a (fourth quarter 2003) and phase 2b (fourth quarter 2004), gross production is expected to increase from 40,000 (22,000 net) boepd to approximately 90,000 (50,000 net) boepd. this new total volume will consist of 54,000 (30,000 net) bpd of condensate, 16,000 (9,000 net) bpd of lpg and 120 (68 net) mmcfd of natural gas. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of marathon worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, the exploration drilling program and additional resources. some factors that could potentially affect worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and the exploration drilling program include acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and gas properties, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the forward-looking information related to production is based on certain assumptions, including, among others, presently known physical data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology development, future drilling success, production experience, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and operating conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 46 table of contents refining, marketing and transportation marathon rm&amp;t segment income is largely dependent upon the refining and wholesale marketing margin for refined products, the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates, and the gross margin on retail merchandise sales. the refining and wholesale marketing margin reflects the difference between the wholesale selling prices of refined products and the cost of raw materials refined, purchased product costs and manufacturing expenses. refining and wholesale marketing margins have been historically volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, the seasonal pattern of certain product sales, crude oil costs, manufacturing costs, the available supply of crude oil and refined products, and logistical constraints. the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates reflects the difference between the retail selling prices of these products and their wholesale cost, including secondary transportation. retail gasoline and distillate margins have also been historically volatile, but tend to be countercyclical to the refining and wholesale marketing margin. factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. the gross margin on retail merchandise sales tends to be less volatile than the retail gasoline and distillate margin. factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items and the level of economic activity in the marketing area. at its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has initiated a multi-year $350 million integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. this program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will reduce the refinery total gasoline pool sulfur below 30 ppm, thereby eliminating the need for additional low sulfur gasoline compliance investments at the refinery. the project is expected to be completed in late 2003. a map subsidiary, ohio river pipe line llc ( orpl ), is building a pipeline from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio. orpl is a common carrier pipeline company and the pipeline will be an interstate common carrier pipeline. the pipeline is currently known as cardinal products pipeline and is expected to initially move about 50,000 barrels per day of refined petroleum into the central ohio region. as of june 2002, orpl had secured all of the rights-of-way required to build the pipeline, and on august 2, 2002, the final permits required to build the pipeline were approved. construction began in august 2002 and start-up of the pipeline is expected to follow in mid-year 2003. on february 7, 2003, map, through ssa, announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell all 193 of its convenience stores located in florida, south carolina, north carolina and georgia for $140 million plus store inventory. the transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2003, subject to any necessary regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. map retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa midwest operations, additional growth in the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. on february 10, 2003, map increased its ownership in centennial pipeline llc from 33 percent to 50 percent. map paid $20 million for the increased ownership interest. as of february 10, 2003, centennial is owned 50 percent each by map and te products pipeline company, limited partnership. on february 27, 2003, map 50 percent owned pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ) purchased 60 retail travel centers including fuel inventory, merchandise and supplies. the 60 locations are in 15 states, primarily in the midwest, southeast and the southwest regions of the country. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the catlettsburg refinery, the cardinal products pipeline system and the disposition of ssa stores. some factors that could potentially cause the actual results from the catlettsburg investment program to differ materially from current expectations include the price of petroleum products, levels of cash flows from operations, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, the completion of construction and regulatory approval constraints. a factor that could impact the cardinal products pipeline is completion of construction. some factors that could affect the ssa stores sale include inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 47 table of contents other energy related businesses marathon has proposed plans and awarded a front end engineering and design contract for a major lng regasification and power generation complex near tijuana in the mexican state of baja california to be called the tijuana regional energy center. the proposed project is an integrated complex planned to consist of a 750 mmcf per day lng offloading terminal and regasification plant, a 1,200-megawatt power generation plant, a 20-million gallon per day water desalination plant, wastewater treatment facilities and natural gas pipeline infrastructure. construction of the facilities is scheduled to begin in 2003 with expected startup in 2006. marathon has awarded a feed contract for the proposed phase 3 lng project in equatorial guinea. the phase 3 expansion involves the construction of a lng liquefaction plant and related facilities to further commercialize the gas resources in the alba field. this project would be complemented by the long-term lng delivery rights at elba island, georgia. in the north sea, marathon will continue discussions with interested parties in evaluating the best transportation alternatives to bring norwegian gas to the u.k. market utilizing marathon brae infrastructure. on october 1, 2002, marathon announced the signing of a letter of intent with rosneft oil company to participate in urals north american marketing, a venture that would transport and market urals crude to the north american market. the venture is subject to the signing of definitive agreements and obtaining necessary u.s. and russian government approvals. expected start-up would be in the fourth quarter of 2003. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the planned construction of lng re-gasification, power generation and related facilities, and the participation in a venture to transport and market urals crude to north america. some factors that could affect the planned construction of the lng re-gasification, power generation and related facilities, include, but are not limited to, unforeseen difficulty in the negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants, identification of additional participants to reach optimum levels of participation, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, arranging sufficient project financing, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, competition with similar projects and environmental and permitting issues. additionally, the lng project could be impacted by the availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels. factors that could impact the transporting and marketing of urals crude to the north american market include the inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unforeseen difficulty in the negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants, arranging sufficient project financing, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, competition with similar projects and environmental and permitting issues. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. corporate matters on february 6, 2003, marathon announced it had approved a capital, investment and exploration expenditure budget of almost $2 billion for 2003. the budget includes e&amp;p spending of $1.1 billion and $732 million for rm&amp;t projects, with the remaining $121 million balance designated for oerb and corporate activities. marathon also announced the intention to sell approximately $400 million in non-core assets to enhance financial flexibility. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to expected capital, investment and exploration expenditures, as well as planned asset dispositions. this forward-looking information is based on certain assumptions including (among others), property dispositions, prices, worldwide supply and demand for petroleum products, regulatory impacts and constraints, timing and results of future exploitation and development drilling, levels of company cash flow, drilling rig availability and other geological operating and economic considerations. the forward-looking information concerning asset dispositions is based upon certain assumptions including the identification of buyers and the negotiation of acceptable prices and other terms, as well as other customary closing conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 48 table of contents accounting standards adopted in the reporting periods effective january 1, 2001, marathon adopted statement of financial accounting standards no. 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities (sfas no. 133), as amended by sfas nos. 137 and 138. this statement requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value. the transition adjustment related to adopting sfas no. 133 on january 1, 2001, was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. the unfavorable cumulative effect on net income was $8 million, net of a tax benefit of $5 million. the unfavorable cumulative effect on other comprehensive income (loss) (oci) was $8 million, net of a tax benefit of $4 million. since the issuance of sfas no. 133, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) has issued several interpretations. as a result, marathon has recognized in income the effect of changes in the fair value of two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the united kingdom. as of january 1, 2002, marathon recognized a favorable cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $13 million, net of tax of $7 million. effective january 1, 2002, marathon adopted the following statements of financial accounting standards: no. 141 business combinations (sfas no. 141), no. 142 goodwill and other intangible assets (sfas no. 142), and no. 144 accounting for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (sfas no.144) sfas no. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001, be accounted for under the purchase method. the transitional provisions of sfas no. 141 required marathon to reclassify $11 million from identifiable intangible assets to goodwill at january 1, 2002. sfas no. 142 addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition. effective january 1, 2002, marathon ceased amortization of existing goodwill, which results in a favorable impact on annual income of approximately $3 million, net of tax. marathon has completed the required transitional impairment test for existing goodwill as of the date of adoption. no impairment of goodwill was indicated. sfas no. 144 establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than by sale. for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, sfas no. 144 broadens the definition of those disposals that should be reported separately as discontinued operations. the adoption of sfas no. 144 had no initial effect on marathon financial statements. in late 2002 and early 2003, the fasb issued the following: statement of financial accounting standards no. 148 accounting for stock-based compensation transition and disclosure (sfas no. 148), fasb interpretation no. 45, guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others (fin 45), and fasb interpretation no. 46, consolidation of variable interest entities (fin 46). each of these pronouncements required the immediate adoption of certain disclosure requirements, which have been reflected in these financial statements. the accounting requirements of these pronouncements will be adopted in future periods. to be adopted in future periods in 2001, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations (sfas no. 143). this statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. for marathon, asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas producing facilities. under previous accounting standards, such obligations were recognized over the life of the producing assets on a units-of-production basis. while certain assets such as refineries, crude oil and product pipelines and marketing assets have retirement obligations covered by sfas no. 143, those obligations are not expected to be recognized since the fair value cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the settlement date of the obligation. 49 table of contents effective january 1, 2003, marathon will adopt sfas no. 143, as required. the cumulative effect on net income of adopting sfas no. 143 is expected to be a net favorable effect of approximately $5 million. at the time of adoption, total assets will increase approximately $120 million, and total liabilities will increase approximately $115 million. the amounts recognized upon adoption are based upon numerous estimates and assumptions, including future retirement costs, future recoverable quantities of oil and gas, future inflation rates and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. previous accounting standards used the units-of-production method to match estimated future retirement costs with the revenues generated from the producing assets. in contrast, sfas no. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. the depreciation will generally be determined on a units-of-production basis, while the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets, the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material. in the second quarter of 2002, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 145 rescission of fasb statements no. 4, 44, and 64, amendment of fasb statement no. 13, and technical corrections (sfas no. 145) and statement of financial accounting standards no. 146 accounting for exit or disposal activities (sfas no. 146). sfas no. 145 has a dual effective date. the provisions relating to the early extinguishment of debt will be adopted by marathon on january 1, 2003. as a result, losses from the early extinguishment of debt in 2002, which are currently reported as extraordinary items, will be reported in income from continuing operations in comparative financial statements subsequent to the adoption of sfas no. 145. sfas no. 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31, 2002. sfas no. 148 provides alternative methods for the transition of the accounting for stock-based compensation from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method. effective january 1, 2003, marathon plans to apply the fair value method to future grants and any modified grants of stock-based compensation. based upon this change, and assuming the number of stock options granted in 2003 approximates the number of those granted in 2002, the estimated impact on marathon 2003 earnings would not be materially different than under previous accounting standards. effective for any guarantees issued or modified january 1, 2003 or after, fin 45 requires the fair-value measurement and recognition of a liability for the issuance of certain guarantees. enhanced disclosure requirements will continue to apply to both new and existing guarantees subject to fin 45. fin 46 identifies certain off-balance sheet arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity (vie). the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that is exposed to the majority of the risks and/or returns of the vie. in future accounting periods, the primary beneficiary will be required to consolidate the vie. in addition, more extensive disclosure requirements apply to the primary beneficiary, as well as other significant investors. although marathon participates in an arrangement that is subject to the disclosure requirements of fin 46, marathon would not be deemed to be a primary beneficiary under the new rules. 50 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations related to commodities, interest rates, and foreign currency. marathon uses commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. to a lesser extent, marathon is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and on petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials. the approach of marathon e&amp;p segment to the use of commodity derivative instruments is selective and opportunistic. when it is deemed to be advantageous, marathon may lock-in market prices on portions of its future production. marathon rm&amp;t segment uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk associated with crude oil and other feedstocks, to protect carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on fixed-price sales of refined products. marathon oerb segment is exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas. marathon uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes. as market conditions change, marathon evaluates its risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of commodity-based derivatives will be based on market prices. from time to time, marathon uses financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures. as marathon enters into derivatives, assessments are made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting. management believes that use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose marathon to material risk. however, the use of derivative instruments could materially affect marathon results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity. commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of its business, marathon is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. to a lesser extent, marathon is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials. marathon strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. as part of achieving marathon strategy, certain fixed-priced physical contracts are hedged using derivative instruments that assume market risk. marathon will use a variety of derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price risk within its different businesses. 51 table of contents commodity price risk sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations ( ifo ) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2002 and december 31, 2001, are provided in the following table: (a) (in millions) incremental decrease in ifo assuming a hypothetical price change of (a) 2002 2001 derivative commodity instruments (b)(c) 10% 25% 10% 25% crude oil (d) $ 32.1 (e) $ 131.6 (e) $ 25.3 (e) $ 57.6 (e) natural gas (d) 38.6 (e) 119.4 (e) 8.6 (e) 18.2 (e) refined products (d) 1.5 (e) 6.5 (e) 1.6 (f) 6.3 (f) (a) marathon remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. amounts reflect hypothetical 10% and 25% changes in closing commodity prices for each open contract position at december 31, 2002 and 2001. marathon evaluates its portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated market conditions and changes in risk profiles. marathon is also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. the creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements to the extent practical. changes to the portfolio subsequent to december 31, 2002, would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented in the table. (b) net open contracts for the combined e&amp;p and oerb segments varied throughout 2002, from a low of 16,556 contracts at february 16 to a high of 43,678 contracts at october 1, and averaged 31,340 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the rm&amp;t segment varied throughout 2002, from a low of 1 contract at march 4 to a high of 19,209 contracts at december 26, and averaged 4,865 for the year. the derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects. (c) the calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated. gains and losses on options are based on changes in intrinsic value only. (d) the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would result in the largest incremental decrease in ifo when applied to the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge that commodity. (e) price increase. (f) price decrease. e&amp;p segment as of december 31, 2002, marathon has entered into zero-cost collars on 225 mmcfd of its u.s. natural gas production for january through december 2003, whereby marathon will receive up to an average $4.72 per mcf but no less than an average $3.72 per mcf. of the 225 mmcfd, 215 mmcfd currently qualify for hedge accounting, with the non-qualified gas volumes being marked-to-market and included in income. additionally, marathon has also entered into zero-cost collars on 29,000 bpd of its u.s. and u.k. crude oil for january through december 2003, whereby marathon will receive up to an average $28.55 per bbl but no less than an average $23.01 per bbl. all 29,000 bpd currently qualify for hedge accounting. subsequent to december 31, 2002, marathon has entered into zero-cost collars on an additional 60 mmcfd of its u.s. natural gas production for the last half of 2003, whereby marathon will receive up to an average $5.94 per mcf but no less than an average $4.25 per mcf. marathon has also placed derivatives on 50 mmcfd at an average of $5.02 per mcf for 2004 relating to the powder river basin area. all 60 mmcfd for the last half of 2003 and 50 mmcfd for 2004 currently qualify for hedge accounting. additionally, marathon has also used other derivative instruments to sell forward, 37,000 bpd of its u.s. and u.k. crude oil for the last half of 2003 at an average of $26.33 per bbl. all 37,000 bpd currently qualify for hedge accounting. as of december 31, 2002, marathon had hedged approximately 18 percent and 15 percent of its forecasted 2003 worldwide equity natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production, respectively. subsequent to december 31, 2002, marathon has hedged an additional 3 percent and 10 percent of its forecasted 2003 worldwide equity natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production, respectively. derivative gains included in the e&amp;p segment were $52 million and $85 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. gains of $23 million from discontinued cash flow hedges for 2002 are included in the aforementioned amounts. these gains were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions will occur. rm&amp;t segment marathon rm&amp;t operations generally use derivative commodity instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstocks, to protect carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on fixed-price sales of refined products. derivative losses included in rm&amp;t segment income were $124 million for 2002 compared with gains of $210 million for 2001. rm&amp;t trading activity gains and losses were not significant for 2002 and 2001. 52 table of contents oerb segment marathon has used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. the underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. similarly, marathon will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term (typically less than a year) fixed price contracts to market prices in its ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. derivative losses included in oerb segment income were $8 million and $29 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. other commodity risk marathon is subject to basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. for example, new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana henry hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices. to the extent that commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. these regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. otc transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk. marathon is subject to liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position. due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions. interest rate risk marathon is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations affecting the fair value of certain financial instruments. a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table: (in millions) december 31, 2002 december 31, 2001 financial instruments (a) fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) financial assets: investments and long-term receivables $ 223 $ $ 160 $ interest rate swap agreements $ 12 $ 8 $ $ financial liabilities: long-term debt (d)(e) $ 5,008 $ 194 $ 3,830 $ 127 (a) fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. (b) see notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for carrying value of instruments. (c) for financial liabilities, this assumes a 10% decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of marathon long-term debt at december 31, 2002 and 2001. (d) includes amounts due within one year. (e) fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. at december 31, 2002 and 2001, marathon portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. this sensitivity is illustrated by the $194 million increase in the fair value of long-term debt assuming a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates. however, marathon sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect marathon results and cash flows only to the extent that marathon would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value. marathon has initiated a program to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. the primary objective of this program is to reduce the company overall cost of borrowing 53 table of contents by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio. in 2002, marathon entered into seven interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. the following table summarizes marathon interest rate swap activity as of december 31, 2002 and march 1, 2003: as of december 31, 2002 floating rate to be paid fixed rate to be received notional amount ($millions) swap maturity 12/31/02 fair value ($millions) six month libor +1.935% six month libor +3.204% 5.375 6.850 % % $ $ 450 200 2007 2008 $ $ 8 4 cumulative as of march 1, 2003 floating rate to be paid fixed rate to be received notional amount ($millions) swap maturity six month libor +4.140% 6.650 % $ 100 2006 six month libor +1.935% 5.375 % $ 450 2007 six month libor +3.285% 6.850 % $ 400 2008 during 2002, marathon entered into u.s. treasury rate lock agreements to hedge pending issuances of new debt. the u.s. treasury rate lock agreements, which were designated and effective as cash flow hedges, were settled for a net of $14 million concurrent with the issuance of the new debt. the $9 million, net of tax, unrecognized loss is being reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net interest and other financial cost over the life of the new debt. foreign currency exchange rate risk marathon is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to anticipated revenues and operating costs, firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. marathon has used on occasion forward currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage this risk. at december 31, 2002 and 2001, marathon had no open forward currency contracts in place. safe harbor marathon quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and other feedstocks. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to marathon hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 54 table of contentsrisk factors 22 risk factors, item 3. legal proceedings, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, state or local regulatory authorities. part i " --> part i item 1. business " --> item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and, from that date, marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc, which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions (the acquisition ), map is now wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. segment and geographic information our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e p ) explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm t ) refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states; and 3) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol on a worldwide basis. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production (in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, production or sales indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.) 2 table of contents as of december 31, 2005 we were conducting exploration, development and production activities in nine countries. principal exploration activities were in the united states, norway, angola, equatorial guinea, the united kingdom and canada. principal development and production activities were in the united states, the united kingdom, ireland, norway, equatorial guinea, gabon and russia. on december 29, 2005, in conjunction with our partners in the former oasis group, we entered into an agreement with the national oil corporation of libya on the terms under which the companies would return to their oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the waha concessions in libya. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. our 2005 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 191,000 barrels per day ( bpd ), an increase of 12 percent from 2004 levels. our 2005 worldwide net natural gas sales, including gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 932 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ), a decrease of 7 percent compared to 2004. in total, our 2005 worldwide net sales averaged 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ) per day, compared to 337,000 boe per day in 2004. (for purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain boe.) in 2006, our worldwide net production available for sale is expected to average approximately 365,000 to 395,000 boe per day, including 40,000 to 45,000 bpd from our libya operations, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions. the above projections of 2006 libya and worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales and production volumes are forward-looking statements. some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of production available for sale include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. exploration in the united states during 2005, we drilled 33 gross (21 net) exploratory wells of which 29 gross (18 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 29 wells, one gross (zero net) well was temporarily suspended. internationally, we drilled 13 gross (six net) exploratory wells of which 11 gross (five net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 11 gross (five net) wells, all were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for us with the potential to add new reserves. at the end of 2005, we had interests in 129 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 96 in the deepwater area. in 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the ozona prospect (garden banks block 515) in the gulf of mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was successful. our plans are to develop this as a subsea tieback to area infrastructure. commercial terms have been secured for the tieback and processing of ozona production and we are attempting to secure a drilling rig to drill the development well. we hold a 68 percent operated interest in the ozona prospect. a well on the flathead prospect (walker ridge block 30) in the gulf of mexico was suspended in 2002. technical evaluations continued during 2005 and are progressing towards a possible re-entry and sidetrack before 2008. in 2005, a well drilled on a block directly offsetting the flathead prospect encountered hydrocarbons. we hold a 100 percent operated interest in the flathead prospect. in 2005, we drilled a well on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508 in the gulf of mexico to total depth and encountered hydrocarbons. additional drilling is required to determine the commerciality of this prospect. we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the stones prospect. other united states exploration activity during 2005 included three gross (three net) wells in the cook inlet area of alaska, all of which were discoveries, and 14 gross (six net) wells in the anadarko basin in oklahoma, 13 gross (six net) of which were discoveries. norway we hold interests in over 1 million gross acres offshore norway and plan to continue our exploration effort there. in late 2005, we began drilling an appraisal well at the outside-operated gudrun discovery, which we expect will be completed in the first quarter of 2006 and followed by an evaluation of the well results. results for the volund well (formerly hamsun) are being analyzed and development scenarios are being examined including a possible tie-back to the alvheim development. we own a 65 percent interest in volund and serve as operator. 3 table of contents angola offshore angola, we own a 10 percent interest in block 31 and a 30 percent interest in block 32. to date we have announced 13 discoveries on these blocks, which reinforces the potential of this trend. on block 31, we have four previously announced discoveries which form a potential development area in the northeastern portion of the block (plutao, saturo, marte and venus). in 2005, we announced five additional discoveries located in the southeastern part of block 31 (palas, ceres, juno, astraea and hebe). on block 32, we previously announced the gindungo and canela discoveries. in 2005, we announced the gengibre discovery and also had a successful appraisal well on this discovery. lastly, in early 2006, we announced another discovery on the mostarda prospect. continued exploration success reinforces the potential for a commercial development on block 32. equatorial guinea during 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the alba block offshore equatorial guinea. the deep luba discovery well, drilled from the alba field production platform, encountered natural gas and condensate in several pay zones. the gardenia discovery well is located approximately 11 miles southwest of the alba field. we are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the deep luba and gardenia discoveries. these discoveries reinforce the potential of the alba block, in which we own a 63 percent interest. in 2003, we announced a natural gas discovery on block d offshore equatorial guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. the discovery well is on the bococo prospect, which is approximately six miles west of the alba field. the well has been suspended for re-entry at a later date. development scenarios for the bococo gas discovery along with three earlier dry gas discoveries on block d are being considered for further development. canada we are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the annapolis lease offshore nova scotia. in addition, we operate the adjacent cortland lease where we own a 75 interest and the adjacent empire lease where we own a 50 percent interest. production (including development activities) united states approximately 40 percent of our 2005 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales and 62 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales were produced from u.s. operations. during 2005, our production in the gulf of mexico averaged 33,800 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 44 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 84 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 14 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon production in the gulf of mexico decreased by 1,900 bpd and net natural gas production decreased by 16 mmcfd from the prior year. the decrease in production is mainly due to natural field declines and the effects of five tropical storms or hurricanes during 2005. in september 2004, our petronius platform suffered damage from hurricane ivan and was out of service until march 2005. at year-end 2005, we held interests in eight producing fields and seven platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which four platforms are operated by marathon. we are one of the largest natural gas producers in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2005 our alaskan net natural gas sales averaged 167 mmcfd, representing 29 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. our natural gas production from alaska is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and increasing during the fourth and first quarters to meet local market winter demands. in addition to our operations in other established alaskan fields, production from the ninilchik field began in 2003 and development continues on the field. ninilchik natural gas is transported through the 32-mile portion of the kenai kachemak pipeline which connects ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the kenai peninsula, in anchorage and in other parts of south central alaska. we operate ninilchik and own a 60 percent interest in it and the section of the kenai kachemak pipeline described above. our 2005 development program in the cook inlet included participation in the drilling of six wells. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from our wyoming fields averaged 20,700 bpd in 2005 compared to 21,200 bpd in 2004. net natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 104 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 108 mmcfd in 2004. the decrease in our wyoming net natural gas sales is primarily attributed to lower production from the powder river basin, which averaged 66 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 69 mmcfd in 2004 primarily as a result of natural field decline, partially offset by development drilling. development of the powder river basin continued in 2005 with approximately 195 wells drilled, compared to approximately 230 wells drilled in 2004. water discharge regulations impacted the pace of development in the powder river basin in 2005. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2005 where we participated in the drilling of 35 wells. net natural gas sales from our oklahoma fields averaged 77 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 82 mmcfd in 2004 primarily as a result of natural field decline, partially offset by development and exploratory drilling. our 2005 development program continued to focus in the anadarko basin where we participated in the drilling of 82 wells. 4 table of contents our share of liquid hydrocarbon sales from the permian basin region, which extends from southeast new mexico to west texas, averaged 15,900 bpd in 2005, compared to 18,900 bpd in 2004. net natural gas sales from our new mexico fields, primarily the indian basin field, averaged 59 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 85 mmcfd in 2004. these decreases in net sales are due to natural field declines. net natural gas sales from our texas fields, primarily located in east texas, averaged 73 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 65 mmcfd in 2004. this increase is primarily attributable to drilling in the pearwood and giddings fields. in addition, active development of the mimms creek field in east texas continued in 2005. during 2005, we announced the sanctioning of the neptune deepwater development on atwater valley blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the gulf of mexico. in 2004, we announced that the neptune 7 appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons. this discovery followed the neptune 3 discovery in 2002 and the neptune 5 discovery in 2003. two successful appraisal sidetrack wells were also drilled from the original neptune 5 location. we hold a 30 percent interest in the neptune unit which is located approximately 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the field will be developed with seven initial subsea wells tied back to a stand alone tension leg platform. fabrication of the platform commenced in late 2005. the drilling and completion of the development wells is expected to begin during the first half of 2006. neptune is expected to begin production in late 2007 or early 2008 reaching full production during 2008. in 2003, we announced the perseus discovery located on viosca knoll block 830 in the gulf of mexico approximately five miles from the petronius platform. production from the initial development well at perseus was expected to begin in 2004 but, due to hurricane activity in september 2004 and the resulting damage to the petronius platform, production was delayed. the initial long-reach development well was drilled from the petronius platform reaching a total depth of 30,855 feet, and first production commenced in april 2005. drilling of a second long-reach development well began in september 2005 and is expected to reach the planned total depth of 31,598 feet in the first quarter of 2006. first production from this second well is anticipated in the second quarter of 2006. we own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in this block. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent interest in the south, central, north, and west brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central brae field and west brae/sedgwick fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field are gas condensate fields. our share of sales from the brae area averaged 18,300 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2005, compared with 15,900 bpd in 2004. the increase primarily resulted from the timing of sales of liquid hydrocarbons and improved performance from the west brae reservoir. our share of brae natural gas sales averaged 169 mmcfd, which was lower than the 197 mmcfd in 2004 as a result of natural field declines in the north and east brae gas condensate fields. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, there are 23 agreements with third-party fields contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the beryl group owns the remaining 50 percent. the sage pipeline transports gas from the brae and beryl areas and has a total wet natural gas capacity of approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and 0.8 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the britannia field. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own an approximate 30 percent interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent of east foinaven and 20 percent of the t35 and t25 accumulations, each of which has a single well. our share of sales from the foinaven fields averaged 16,000 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 9 mmcfd of natural gas in 2005, compared to 21,900 bpd and 10 mmcfd in 2004, primarily as a result of the timing of sales of liquid hydrocarbons; however, reliability issues and natural field declines also contributed to the decrease. norway we are the operator and own a 65 percent interest in the alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf. this development is comprised of the kneler and boa discoveries and the previously undeveloped kameleon accumulation. during 2004, we received approval from the norwegian authorities for our alvheim plan of development and operation ( pdo ), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ( fpso ) with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. the pdo also outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the sage system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. marathon and its alvheim project partners signed a purchase and sale agreement in 2004 for the odin multipurpose shuttle tanker, which will be modified to an fpso. in 2004, 5 table of contents the alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, subject to the approval of the norwegian government. in 2005, the norwegian government approved the vilje pdo. our share of production from a combined alvheim/vilje development is expected to reach more than 50,000 boe per day with first production starting in early 2007. during 2005, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in norway from the heimdal, vale, byggve and skirne fields averaged 2,000 bpd and 34 mmcfd. we own a 24 percent interest in the heimdal field, a 47 percent interest in the vale field and a 20 percent interest in the skirne field, which came on stream during 2004. ireland we own a 100 percent interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale fields in the celtic sea offshore ireland. net natural gas sales were 50 mmcfd in 2005, compared with 58 mmcfd in 2004. in february 2006, we acquired an 86.5 percent operated interest in the seven heads natural gas field. previously, we processed and transported natural gas and we provided field operating services to the seven heads group through our existing kinsale head facilities. we own an 18.5 percent interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located approximately 40 miles off ireland west coast. during 2004, an bord plean la (the planning board) upheld the mayo county council decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at bellanaboy bridge, county mayo, which will process natural gas from the corrib field. development activities started in late 2004 but were suspended in 2005 pending resolution of issues raised by opponents of the project. a government-commissioned independent safety review of the onshore pipeline associated with the proposed development has been completed and we are awaiting publication of the related report. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant held through an equity method investee. during 2005, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 39,600 bpd and net natural gas sales averaged 92 mmcfd, compared to 18,900 bpd and 76 mmcfd in 2004. a condensate expansion project in equatorial guinea was completed during 2004 and ramped up to full production in early 2005. this expansion project increased condensate production from approximately 15,000 gross bpd to approximately 67,000 gross bpd (38,000 bpd net to marathon). a liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) expansion project in equatorial guinea ramped up to full production in the third quarter of 2005. gross lpg production increased from approximately 3,000 gross bpd to 19,000 gross bpd (11,000 bpd net to marathon). liquid hydrocarbon production continues to increase as a result of the expansion projects. total production available for sale in january 2006 was approximately 90,000 gross bpd (51,000 bpd net to marathon). approximately 130 mmcfd of dry gas remaining after the condensate and lpg are removed is supplied to atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ), where it is used to manufacture methanol. we own 45 percent of ampco, which is reported in the integrated gas segment. remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production when the lng plant construction project on bioko island, discussed below under integrated gas, is completed. libya we hold a 16.33 percent interest in the waha concessions, which currently produce approximately 350,000 gross boe per day and encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. as a result of our return to operations in libya, we expect to add approximately 40,000 to 45,000 net bpd of production available for sale during 2006. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent interest. net sales in gabon averaged 12,100 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2005, compared with 13,600 bpd in 2004. production from these three fields is processed on a single facility at tchatamba marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. russia during 2003 we acquired khanty mansiysk oil corporation ( kmoc ). kmoc fields are located in the khanty mansiysk region of western siberia. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from these assets averaged 26,600 bpd during 2005, primarily from the east kamennoye and potenay fields. development activities continued in 2005, with 82 wells drilled in east kamennoye. other matters we hold an interest in an exploration and production license in sudan. we suspended operations in sudan in 1985. we have had no employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. we have abided and will continue to abide by all u.s. sanctions related to sudan and will not consider resuming any activity regarding our interests there until such time as it is permitted under u.s. law. we discovered the ash shaer and cherrife gas fields in syria in the 1980s. we submitted four plans of development to the syrian petroleum company in the 1990s, but none were approved. the syrian government subsequently claimed that the production sharing contract for these fields had expired. we have been involved in an 6 table of contents ongoing dispute with the syrian petroleum company and government of syria over our interest in these fields. we are discussing a settlement under which a new production sharing contract would be executed to provide us the right to sell all or a significant portion of our interest to a third party. we have and will continue to comply with all u.s. sanctions related to syria. the above discussion of the e p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing of completion of the gudrun appraisal well, the possibility of developing blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the timing and levels of production from the neptune development, the perseus discovery, the combined alvheim/vilje development and estimated levels of production associated with our re-entry into libya. some factors which could affect the timing of completion of the gudrun appraisal well, the possible development of blocks 31 and 32, the timing and production levels of the neptune development, the perseus discovery, the alvheim/vilje development and estimated levels of production in libya include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, inability or delays in obtaining necessary government or third-party approvals or permits, timing of commencing production from new wells, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the estimated levels of production in libya and possible developments in blocks 31 and 32 could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 7 table of contents reserves at december 31, 2005, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled approximately

boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2005, less than 20 percent have been included as proved reserves for more than three years while approximately 18 percent were added during 2005. during 2005, we added net proved reserves of 282 million boe, excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while producing 124 million boe. these net additions included 165 million boe as a result of our re-entry into libya, 50 million boe of extensions, discoveries and other additions, and total revisions of 58 million boe. of the total net reserve additions, 215 million boe were proved developed and 67 million boe were proved undeveloped. additionally, we transferred 121 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed during 2005. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves, were $955 million, $708 million and $780 million. these amounts include our proportionate share of equity method investees costs incurred as these were costs necessary for the development of proved undeveloped reserves. as of december 31, 2005, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2006 through 2008 are projected to be $868 million, $340 million and $175 million. 8 table of contents the alba field in equatorial guinea had the most significant positive revisions, totaling 47 million boe. of this volume, 21 million boe was added due to the progress on the equatorial guinea lng project, which will provide a market for the alba field natural gas reserves sooner and to a greater extent under the current production sharing contract than was expected when proved reserves were estimated at the end of 2004. at the end of 2005, our total proved reserves associated with the alba field offshore equatorial guinea totaled 505 million boe, or 39 percent of our total proved reserves. the above estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves and timing of production from development projects are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. for additional details of estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves on pages f-46 through f-47. we filed reports with the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) for the years 2004 and 2003 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and natural gas reserves. we will file a similar report for 2005. the year-end estimates reported to the doe are the same as the estimates reported in the supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements. in alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with local utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 152 bcf of natural gas over the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2018. during 2005, we entered into another agreement with a local utility company which, pending regulatory commission of alaska approval, will obligate us to supply approximately 60 bcf of natural gas between 2009 and 2018. in addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska lng plant and a proportionate share of the long-term lng sales obligation to two japanese utility companies. this obligation is estimated to total 62 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates in 2009. these commitments are structured with variable-pricing terms. our production from various natural gas fields in the cook inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. our proved reserves in the cook inlet are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. in the u.k., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 190 bcf of natural gas through the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2009. our brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. pricing under these natural gas sales contracts is variable. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contracts. 9 table of contents oil and natural gas net sales the following tables set forth daily average

llc ( ssa ) and marathon pipe line llc. refining we own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 974,000 barrels of crude oil per day. the table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our refineries as of december 31, 2005: crude oil refining capacity (barrels per day) garyville, louisiana 245,000 catlettsburg, kentucky 222,000 robinson, illinois 192,000 detroit, michigan 100,000 canton, ohio 73,000 texas city, texas 72,000 st. paul park, minnesota 70,000 total 974,000 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low sulfur gasolines. our refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect the refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. we increased our overall crude oil refining capacity during 2005 from 948,000 bpd to 974,000 bpd after completing the expansion project at our detroit refinery. this expansion increased crude oil capacity at detroit from 74,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd. the project also improves operating efficiency and enables the detroit refinery to meet new lower gasoline and diesel sulfur specifications. during 2005, we announced plans to evaluate a 180,000 bpd expansion of our garyville refinery. the initial phase of the potential expansion includes front-end engineering and design ( feed ) work which began in december 2005 and could lead to the start of construction in 2007. the project, estimated to cost approximately $2.2 billion, could be completed as early as the fourth quarter of 2009. the final investment decision is subject to completion of the feed work and the receipt of applicable permits. we also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. we manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax. during 2005, our refineries processed 973,000 bpd of crude oil and 205,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years: refined product yields (thousands of barrels per day) 2005 2004 2003 gasoline 644 608 567 distillates 318 299 284 propane 21

certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. we completed major turnarounds at our detroit and catlettsburg refineries in 2005. marketing in 2005, our refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 21.1 billion gallons (1,378,000 bpd). the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 71 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2005, excluding sales related to matching buy/sell transactions. approximately 53 percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 91 percent of our distillate sales volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis. approximately half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the united states and canada, with pitch products also being exported worldwide. we market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast. our customer base includes approximately 830 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. the following table sets forth our refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 2005 2004 2003 gasoline 836 807 776 distillates 385 373 365 propane 22 22

parts of our marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin. we also sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. as of december 31, 2005, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,000 marathon branded retail outlets located primarily in michigan, ohio, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in florida, georgia, minnesota, wisconsin, west virginia, tennessee, virginia, north carolina, pennsylvania, alabama and south carolina. ssa sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated retail outlets. as of december 31, 2005, ssa had 1,638 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names speedway and superamerica. ssa revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.5 billion in 2005, compared with $2.3 billion in 2004. profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. ssa also operates 60 valvoline instant oil change retail outlets located in michigan and northwest ohio. pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ), our joint venture with pilot corporation ( pilot ), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with approximately 260 locations in 37 states at december 31, 2005. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand-name restaurants. pilot and marathon each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. our marketing strategy is focused on ssa midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. 14 table of contents supply and transportation we obtain the crude oil we process from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. in 2005, our net purchases of u.s. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged 447,000 bpd, or 46 percent of crude oil processed, including a net 12,000 bpd from our production operations. in 2005, canada was the source for 11 percent, or 111,000 bpd, of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 43 percent, or 415,000 bpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including approximately 221,000 bpd from the middle east. this crude was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. we operate a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing areas. at december 31, 2005, we owned or leased approximately 2,774 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,824 miles of refined product trunk lines. at december 31, 2005 we had interests in the following pipelines: 100 percent ownership of ohio river pipe line llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio, known as cardinal products pipeline; 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting gulf coast refineries with the midwest market; 51 percent interest in loop llc ( loop ), which is the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois; 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, which is a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest; 33 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of mpc st. paul park, minnesota refinery; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana to north muskegon, michigan; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois to toledo, ohio. our 85 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeast. these facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. our marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. we also lease and own rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors and tank trailers. effective october 15, 2006, most of the diesel fuel sold for highway use must contain no more than 15 parts per million of sulfur at the retail outlet. this new ultra low sulfur diesel ( ulsd ) fuel requirement will place a premium on ensuring that there is no contamination of the ulsd while it is in transit to the retail outlet. we expect to be able to meet these requirements. the above discussion of the rm t segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the possible expansion of the garyville refinery. some factors that could affect the garyville expansion project include the results of the feed work, necessary regulatory approvals, crude oil supply and transportation logistics, necessary permits and continued favorable investment climate, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 15 table of contents integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations, methanol operations, certain other gas processing facilities and pipeline operations, and marketing and transportation of natural gas. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects. alaska lng we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, the lng has been sold under a long-term contract with two of japan largest utility companies. this contract continues through march 2009, with 2005 lng deliveries totaling 65 gross bcf (22 net bcf). equatorial guinea lng project in 2004, we and our partner, compania nacional de petroleos de guinea ecuatorial ( gepetrol ), the national oil company of equatorial guinea, through equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ), began construction of an lng plant on bioko island that will initially deliver a contracted offtake of 3.4 million metric tons per year beginning in 2007 (approximately 460 mmcfd) under a sales and purchase agreement with a subsidiary of bg group plc ( bgml ). bgml will purchase the lng plant production for a period of 17 years on an fob bioko island basis with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. the lng plant is ultimately expected to have the ability to operate at higher rates and for a longer period than the current contracted offtake rate and term. this project will allow us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the plant will be purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. construction of the plant is ahead of schedule with first shipment of lng expected in the third quarter of 2007. on july 25, 2005, marathon and gepetrol entered into agreements under which mitsui co., ltd. ( mitsui ) and a subsidiary of marubeni corporation ( marubeni ) acquired 8.5 percent and 6.5 percent interests, respectively, in egholdings. following the transaction, we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, with gepetrol holding a 25 percent interest and mitsui and marubeni holding the remaining interests. the egholdings partners are also exploring the feasibility of adding a second lng train in an effort to create a regional gas hub that would commercialize stranded natural gas from various sources in the surrounding gulf of guinea region. elba island lng in april 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes as part of our elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal capacity rights agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we can supply up to 58 billion cubic feet of natural gas (as lng) per year into the terminal through 2021 with a possible extension to 2023. in september 2004, we signed an agreement with bp energy company ( bp ) under which bp will supply us with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years. the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement with bp enables us to fully utilize our capacity rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of the bp contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. methanol we own a 45 percent interest in atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ), which owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the alba field. methanol sales totaled 1,052,000 gross metric tons (473,000 net metric tons) in 2005. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. ampco will undergo a scheduled maintenance shutdown during the second quarter of 2006. during the outage, ampco will also seek to remove bottlenecks in several parts of the plant. natural gas marketing and transportation activities in addition to the sale of our own natural gas production, we purchase gas from third-party producers and marketers for resale. 16 table of contents during 2005, we sold our 24 percent interest in nautilus pipeline company, llc and our 24 percent interest in manta ray offshore gathering company, llc, which are both gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems. we still own a 34 percent interest in the neptune natural gas processing plant located in st. mary parish, louisiana. the plant has the capacity to process 600 mmcfd of natural gas, which is supplied by the nautilus pipeline system. gas technology we invest in gas technology research, including gas-to -liquids ( gtl ) technology which was successfully applied in a gtl demonstration plant at the port of catoosa, oklahoma in 2004. in addition to gtl, we are continuing to explore gas technologies including methanol to power, gas to fuels and compressed natural gas technologies. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of production associated with the lng plant and the possible expansion thereof. factors that could affect the lng plant include, unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. in addition to these factors, other factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the current lng project and the development of additional lng capacity through additional projects include partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies, as well as national oil companies, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and natural gas. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to -work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, we believe we currently rank ninth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2005. we compete in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products. we believe we compete with about 30 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; nine refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 220 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway tm . we also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in ptc. our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. 17 table of contents as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. effective january 31, 2006, thomas j. usher retired as chairman of the board of directors and as a director of united states steel, and dr. shirley ann jackson retired as a director of united states steel. as a result, three remaining members of our board of directors are also directors of united states steel. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all marathon principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by marathon: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for marathon discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. united states steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed lease obligations. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee marathon provided with respect to all united states steel obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. 18 table of contents tax sharing agreement marathon and united states steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. provisions of this agreement include the following: for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before december 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between marathon and united states steel generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation; no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after december 31, 2001; and provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free transaction and limitations on post-separation activities that might jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation. under the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation: the taxes payable by each of the marathon group and the u.s. steel group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return; and the u.s. steel group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable. in accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the separation, marathon made a preliminary settlement with united states steel of approximately $440 million as the net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended december 31, 2001 under the pre-separation tax sharing principles. the tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended before december 31, 2001. in the tax sharing agreement, each of marathon and united states steel promised the other party that it: would not, before january 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation; and would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from the separation ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction. the prescribed actions and transactions include: the liquidation of marathon or united states steel; and the sale by marathon or united states steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business. in case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability. even if the separation otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code, the separation may become taxable to marathon under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either marathon or united states steel is acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the separation. for this purpose, a 50 percent or greater interest means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. to minimize this risk, both marathon and united states steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their equity structures that could cause the separation to be treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the internal revenue code may apply. if an acquisition occurs that results in the separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that acquisition transaction. although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the separation, each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the separation, is jointly and severally liable under the internal revenue code for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes 19 table of contents indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. marathon can provide no assurance, however, that united states steel will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2005 see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel for a discussion of marathon obligations associated with the separation. environmental matters we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors. our corporate responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. the corporate responsibility management committee, which is comprised of certain of our officers, is charged with reviewing our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving marathon or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies and legal proceedings. air of particular significance to our refining operations are u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. our combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. costs incurred through december 31, 2005 were approximately $825 million, with the remainder expected to be incurred in 2006. this is a forward-looking statement. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include completion of construction and start-up activities. the epa has finalized new and revised national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions (pm2.5) and ozone. in connection with these new standards, the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, in january 2004, the epa proposed a rule called the interstate air quality rule ( iaqr ) that would require significant reductions of so 2 and nox emissions in numerous states. the final rule was promulgated on may 12, 2005, and the rule was renamed the clean air interstate rule ( cair ). while the epa expects that states will meet their cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units ( egus ), states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. our refinery operations are located in affected states and some states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair requirements; however we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the states have taken further action. 20 table of contents water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. as of december 31, 2005, all of the barges used for river transport of our feedstocks and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at some of our rm t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. ongoing rcra-related costs are not expected to be material. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. employees we had 27,756 active employees as of december 31, 2005. of that number, 18,257 were employees of speedway superamerica llc, most of which were employed at retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2009. the same union represents certain hourly employees at our texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2009. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2006 at our st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2007 at our detroit refinery. available information general information about marathon, including the corporate governance principles and charters for the audit committee, compensation committee, corporate governance and

table of contents item 1a. risk factors " --> item 1a. risk factors marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. the following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices would reduce our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth. prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and refined products. historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of oil, natural gas and refined products are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil and natural gas; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions; and domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes. the long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil and natural gas are uncertain. lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we produce, which may reduce our revenues and operating income. significant reductions in oil and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures. estimates of oil and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our oil and natural gas reserves. the proved oil and natural gas reserve information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. those estimates were prepared by our personnel and reviewed, on a selected basis, by third-party petroleum engineers. the estimates were calculated using oil and natural gas prices in effect as of december 31, 2005, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. any significant future price changes may have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of oil and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves included in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by generally accepted accounting principles, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based generally on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. 22 table of contents if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future oil and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and natural gas is produced. increases in crude oil prices and environmental regulations may reduce our refined product margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall rm t profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refined product margins have been historically volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. in addition, environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on refining and marketing operations, which may reduce our refined product margins. if we do not compete successfully with our competitors, our future operating performance and profitability could materially decline. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies, as well as national oil companies, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. in addition, in implementing our integrated gas strategy, we compete with major integrated energy companies in bidding for and developing liquefied natural gas projects, which are very capital intensive. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional properties and bidding for and developing additional projects, such as lng plants. many of our larger competitors in the lng market can complete more projects than we have the capacity to complete, which could lead those competitors to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. in addition, many of our larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas, such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on each of our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of their operating facilities, marketing area and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures or may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement action against us. our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. 23 table of contents worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability. local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. approximately 50 percent of our oil and natural gas production in 2005 was derived from production outside the united states and approximately 70 percent of our proved reserves as of december 31, 2005 were located outside the united states. in addition, we are increasing the focus of our development operations on areas outside the united states. there are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation or may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could cause a downturn in the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. more specifically, these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverages that we consider adequate. actions of the united states government through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and overseas. the united states government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various countries. actions by both the united states and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and maritime accidents. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling and production and could materially reduce our profitability. if ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland. as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland, marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) for tax years of ashland still open as of the date we completed the transactions. we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to ashland interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions. however, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service. if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland. in that event, our 24 table of contents indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland. marathon is required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland, which could be material. we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions. under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two baskets, as described below: basket one this applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland. the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one. upon specified events related to ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two. in addition, basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two. because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland pre-transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two. the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a with and without basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group. thus, if the marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland. because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group tax liability for a particular year. this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation, ashland is required to repay such compensation to marathon. in the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of the interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court may review our recently completed transactions with ashland under the fraudulent transfer provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland. under the u.s. bankruptcy code and the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or, in some jurisdictions, less than fair consideration or valuable consideration; and 25 table of contents the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. in connection with our recently completed transactions with ashland, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland shareholders. in order to help establish that ashland nevertheless received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired. we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. those opinions were based on specific information provided to it and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to ashland existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) ashland receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) ashland solvency, it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon, united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $597 million as of december 31, 2005, including accrued interest of $9 million. if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel. in that event, our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel. under applicable law and regulations, we also may be liable for any defaults by united states steel in the performance of its obligations to pay federal income taxes, fund its erisa pension plans and pay other obligations related to periods prior to the effective date of the separation. united states steel has non-investment grade credit ratings and has granted security interests in some of its assets. the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. if the transfer of ownership of various assets and operations by marathon former parent entity to marathon was held to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, united states steel creditors may be able to obtain recovery from us or other relief detrimental to the holders of our common stock. in july 2001, usx corporation ( old usx ) effected a reorganization of the ownership of its businesses in which it created marathon as its publicly owned parent holding company and transferred ownership of various assets and operations to marathon, and it merged into a newly formed subsidiary which survived as united states steel. if a court in a bankruptcy case regarding united states steel or a lawsuit brought by its creditors or their representative were to find that, under the applicable fraudulent conveyance or transfer law: the transfer by old usx to marathon or related transactions were undertaken by old usx with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its existing or future creditors; or old usx received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration, or no value or consideration, in connection with those transactions, and either it or united states steel was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of those transactions, 26 table of contents was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature, then that court could determine those transactions entitled one or more classes of creditors of united states steel to equitable relief from us. such a determination could permit the unpaid creditors to obtain recovery from us or could result in other actions detrimental to the holders of our common stock. the measure of insolvency for purposes of these considerations would vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict

1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, state or local regulatory authorities. part i " --> part i item 1. business " --> item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and, from that date, marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc, which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions (the acquisition ), map is now wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. segment and geographic information our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e p ) explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm t ) refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states; and 3) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol on a worldwide basis. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production (in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, production or sales indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.) 2 table of contents as of december 31, 2005 we were conducting exploration, development and production activities in nine countries. principal exploration activities were in the united states, norway, angola, equatorial guinea, the united kingdom and canada. principal development and production activities were in the united states, the united kingdom, ireland, norway, equatorial guinea, gabon and russia. on december 29, 2005, in conjunction with our partners in the former oasis group, we entered into an agreement with the national oil corporation of libya on the terms under which the companies would return to their oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the waha concessions in libya. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. our 2005 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 191,000 barrels per day ( bpd ), an increase of 12 percent from 2004 levels. our 2005 worldwide net natural gas sales, including gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 932 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ), a decrease of 7 percent compared to 2004. in total, our 2005 worldwide net sales averaged 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ) per day, compared to 337,000 boe per day in 2004. (for purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain boe.) in 2006, our worldwide net production available for sale is expected to average approximately 365,000 to 395,000 boe per day, including 40,000 to 45,000 bpd from our libya operations, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions. the above projections of 2006 libya and worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales and production volumes are forward-looking statements. some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of production available for sale include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. exploration in the united states during 2005, we drilled 33 gross (21 net) exploratory wells of which 29 gross (18 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 29 wells, one gross (zero net) well was temporarily suspended. internationally, we drilled 13 gross (six net) exploratory wells of which 11 gross (five net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 11 gross (five net) wells, all were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for us with the potential to add new reserves. at the end of 2005, we had interests in 129 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 96 in the deepwater area. in 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the ozona prospect (garden banks block 515) in the gulf of mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was successful. our plans are to develop this as a subsea tieback to area infrastructure. commercial terms have been secured for the tieback and processing of ozona production and we are attempting to secure a drilling rig to drill the development well. we hold a 68 percent operated interest in the ozona prospect. a well on the flathead prospect (walker ridge block 30) in the gulf of mexico was suspended in 2002. technical evaluations continued during 2005 and are progressing towards a possible re-entry and sidetrack before 2008. in 2005, a well drilled on a block directly offsetting the flathead prospect encountered hydrocarbons. we hold a 100 percent operated interest in the flathead prospect. in 2005, we drilled a well on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508 in the gulf of mexico to total depth and encountered hydrocarbons. additional drilling is required to determine the commerciality of this prospect. we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the stones prospect. other united states exploration activity during 2005 included three gross (three net) wells in the cook inlet area of alaska, all of which were discoveries, and 14 gross (six net) wells in the anadarko basin in oklahoma, 13 gross (six net) of which were discoveries. norway we hold interests in over 1 million gross acres offshore norway and plan to continue our exploration effort there. in late 2005, we began drilling an appraisal well at the outside-operated gudrun discovery, which we expect will be completed in the first quarter of 2006 and followed by an evaluation of the well results. results for the volund well (formerly hamsun) are being analyzed and development scenarios are being examined including a possible tie-back to the alvheim development. we own a 65 percent interest in volund and serve as operator. 3 table of contents angola offshore angola, we own a 10 percent interest in block 31 and a 30 percent interest in block 32. to date we have announced 13 discoveries on these blocks, which reinforces the potential of this trend. on block 31, we have four previously announced discoveries which form a potential development area in the northeastern portion of the block (plutao, saturo, marte and venus). in 2005, we announced five additional discoveries located in the southeastern part of block 31 (palas, ceres, juno, astraea and hebe). on block 32, we previously announced the gindungo and canela discoveries. in 2005, we announced the gengibre discovery and also had a successful appraisal well on this discovery. lastly, in early 2006, we announced another discovery on the mostarda prospect. continued exploration success reinforces the potential for a commercial development on block 32. equatorial guinea during 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the alba block offshore equatorial guinea. the deep luba discovery well, drilled from the alba field production platform, encountered natural gas and condensate in several pay zones. the gardenia discovery well is located approximately 11 miles southwest of the alba field. we are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the deep luba and gardenia discoveries. these discoveries reinforce the potential of the alba block, in which we own a 63 percent interest. in 2003, we announced a natural gas discovery on block d offshore equatorial guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. the discovery well is on the bococo prospect, which is approximately six miles west of the alba field. the well has been suspended for re-entry at a later date. development scenarios for the bococo gas discovery along with three earlier dry gas discoveries on block d are being considered for further development. canada we are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the annapolis lease offshore nova scotia. in addition, we operate the adjacent cortland lease where we own a 75 interest and the adjacent empire lease where we own a 50 percent interest. production (including development activities) united states approximately 40 percent of our 2005 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales and 62 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales were produced from u.s. operations. during 2005, our production in the gulf of mexico averaged 33,800 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 44 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 84 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 14 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon production in the gulf of mexico decreased by 1,900 bpd and net natural gas production decreased by 16 mmcfd from the prior year. the decrease in production is mainly due to natural field declines and the effects of five tropical storms or hurricanes during 2005. in september 2004, our petronius platform suffered damage from hurricane ivan and was out of service until march 2005. at year-end 2005, we held interests in eight producing fields and seven platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which four platforms are operated by marathon. we are one of the largest natural gas producers in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2005 our alaskan net natural gas sales averaged 167 mmcfd, representing 29 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. our natural gas production from alaska is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and increasing during the fourth and first quarters to meet local market winter demands. in addition to our operations in other established alaskan fields, production from the ninilchik field began in 2003 and development continues on the field. ninilchik natural gas is transported through the 32-mile portion of the kenai kachemak pipeline which connects ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the kenai peninsula, in anchorage and in other parts of south central alaska. we operate ninilchik and own a 60 percent interest in it and the section of the kenai kachemak pipeline described above. our 2005 development program in the cook inlet included participation in the drilling of six wells. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from our wyoming fields averaged 20,700 bpd in 2005 compared to 21,200 bpd in 2004. net natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 104 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 108 mmcfd in 2004. the decrease in our wyoming net natural gas sales is primarily attributed to lower production from the powder river basin, which averaged 66 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 69 mmcfd in 2004 primarily as a result of natural field decline, partially offset by development drilling. development of the powder river basin continued in 2005 with approximately 195 wells drilled, compared to approximately 230 wells drilled in 2004. water discharge regulations impacted the pace of development in the powder river basin in 2005. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2005 where we participated in the drilling of 35 wells. net natural gas sales from our oklahoma fields averaged 77 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 82 mmcfd in 2004 primarily as a result of natural field decline, partially offset by development and exploratory drilling. our 2005 development program continued to focus in the anadarko basin where we participated in the drilling of 82 wells. 4 table of contents our share of liquid hydrocarbon sales from the permian basin region, which extends from southeast new mexico to west texas, averaged 15,900 bpd in 2005, compared to 18,900 bpd in 2004. net natural gas sales from our new mexico fields, primarily the indian basin field, averaged 59 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 85 mmcfd in 2004. these decreases in net sales are due to natural field declines. net natural gas sales from our texas fields, primarily located in east texas, averaged 73 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 65 mmcfd in 2004. this increase is primarily attributable to drilling in the pearwood and giddings fields. in addition, active development of the mimms creek field in east texas continued in 2005. during 2005, we announced the sanctioning of the neptune deepwater development on atwater valley blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the gulf of mexico. in 2004, we announced that the neptune 7 appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons. this discovery followed the neptune 3 discovery in 2002 and the neptune 5 discovery in 2003. two successful appraisal sidetrack wells were also drilled from the original neptune 5 location. we hold a 30 percent interest in the neptune unit which is located approximately 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the field will be developed with seven initial subsea wells tied back to a stand alone tension leg platform. fabrication of the platform commenced in late 2005. the drilling and completion of the development wells is expected to begin during the first half of 2006. neptune is expected to begin production in late 2007 or early 2008 reaching full production during 2008. in 2003, we announced the perseus discovery located on viosca knoll block 830 in the gulf of mexico approximately five miles from the petronius platform. production from the initial development well at perseus was expected to begin in 2004 but, due to hurricane activity in september 2004 and the resulting damage to the petronius platform, production was delayed. the initial long-reach development well was drilled from the petronius platform reaching a total depth of 30,855 feet, and first production commenced in april 2005. drilling of a second long-reach development well began in september 2005 and is expected to reach the planned total depth of 31,598 feet in the first quarter of 2006. first production from this second well is anticipated in the second quarter of 2006. we own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in this block. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent interest in the south, central, north, and west brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central brae field and west brae/sedgwick fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field are gas condensate fields. our share of sales from the brae area averaged 18,300 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2005, compared with 15,900 bpd in 2004. the increase primarily resulted from the timing of sales of liquid hydrocarbons and improved performance from the west brae reservoir. our share of brae natural gas sales averaged 169 mmcfd, which was lower than the 197 mmcfd in 2004 as a result of natural field declines in the north and east brae gas condensate fields. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, there are 23 agreements with third-party fields contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the beryl group owns the remaining 50 percent. the sage pipeline transports gas from the brae and beryl areas and has a total wet natural gas capacity of approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and 0.8 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the britannia field. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own an approximate 30 percent interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent of east foinaven and 20 percent of the t35 and t25 accumulations, each of which has a single well. our share of sales from the foinaven fields averaged 16,000 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 9 mmcfd of natural gas in 2005, compared to 21,900 bpd and 10 mmcfd in 2004, primarily as a result of the timing of sales of liquid hydrocarbons; however, reliability issues and natural field declines also contributed to the decrease. norway we are the operator and own a 65 percent interest in the alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf. this development is comprised of the kneler and boa discoveries and the previously undeveloped kameleon accumulation. during 2004, we received approval from the norwegian authorities for our alvheim plan of development and operation ( pdo ), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ( fpso ) with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. the pdo also outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the sage system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. marathon and its alvheim project partners signed a purchase and sale agreement in 2004 for the odin multipurpose shuttle tanker, which will be modified to an fpso. in 2004, 5 table of contents the alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, subject to the approval of the norwegian government. in 2005, the norwegian government approved the vilje pdo. our share of production from a combined alvheim/vilje development is expected to reach more than 50,000 boe per day with first production starting in early 2007. during 2005, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in norway from the heimdal, vale, byggve and skirne fields averaged 2,000 bpd and 34 mmcfd. we own a 24 percent interest in the heimdal field, a 47 percent interest in the vale field and a 20 percent interest in the skirne field, which came on stream during 2004. ireland we own a 100 percent interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale fields in the celtic sea offshore ireland. net natural gas sales were 50 mmcfd in 2005, compared with 58 mmcfd in 2004. in february 2006, we acquired an 86.5 percent operated interest in the seven heads natural gas field. previously, we processed and transported natural gas and we provided field operating services to the seven heads group through our existing kinsale head facilities. we own an 18.5 percent interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located approximately 40 miles off ireland west coast. during 2004, an bord plean la (the planning board) upheld the mayo county council decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at bellanaboy bridge, county mayo, which will process natural gas from the corrib field. development activities started in late 2004 but were suspended in 2005 pending resolution of issues raised by opponents of the project. a government-commissioned independent safety review of the onshore pipeline associated with the proposed development has been completed and we are awaiting publication of the related report. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant held through an equity method investee. during 2005, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 39,600 bpd and net natural gas sales averaged 92 mmcfd, compared to 18,900 bpd and 76 mmcfd in 2004. a condensate expansion project in equatorial guinea was completed during 2004 and ramped up to full production in early 2005. this expansion project increased condensate production from approximately 15,000 gross bpd to approximately 67,000 gross bpd (38,000 bpd net to marathon). a liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) expansion project in equatorial guinea ramped up to full production in the third quarter of 2005. gross lpg production increased from approximately 3,000 gross bpd to 19,000 gross bpd (11,000 bpd net to marathon). liquid hydrocarbon production continues to increase as a result of the expansion projects. total production available for sale in january 2006 was approximately 90,000 gross bpd (51,000 bpd net to marathon). approximately 130 mmcfd of dry gas remaining after the condensate and lpg are removed is supplied to atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ), where it is used to manufacture methanol. we own 45 percent of ampco, which is reported in the integrated gas segment. remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production when the lng plant construction project on bioko island, discussed below under integrated gas, is completed. libya we hold a 16.33 percent interest in the waha concessions, which currently produce approximately 350,000 gross boe per day and encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. as a result of our return to operations in libya, we expect to add approximately 40,000 to 45,000 net bpd of production available for sale during 2006. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent interest. net sales in gabon averaged 12,100 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2005, compared with 13,600 bpd in 2004. production from these three fields is processed on a single facility at tchatamba marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. russia during 2003 we acquired khanty mansiysk oil corporation ( kmoc ). kmoc fields are located in the khanty mansiysk region of western siberia. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from these assets averaged 26,600 bpd during 2005, primarily from the east kamennoye and potenay fields. development activities continued in 2005, with 82 wells drilled in east kamennoye. other matters we hold an interest in an exploration and production license in sudan. we suspended operations in sudan in 1985. we have had no employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. we have abided and will continue to abide by all u.s. sanctions related to sudan and will not consider resuming any activity regarding our interests there until such time as it is permitted under u.s. law. we discovered the ash shaer and cherrife gas fields in syria in the 1980s. we submitted four plans of development to the syrian petroleum company in the 1990s, but none were approved. the syrian government subsequently claimed that the production sharing contract for these fields had expired. we have been involved in an 6 table of contents ongoing dispute with the syrian petroleum company and government of syria over our interest in these fields. we are discussing a settlement under which a new production sharing contract would be executed to provide us the right to sell all or a significant portion of our interest to a third party. we have and will continue to comply with all u.s. sanctions related to syria. the above discussion of the e p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing of completion of the gudrun appraisal well, the possibility of developing blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the timing and levels of production from the neptune development, the perseus discovery, the combined alvheim/vilje development and estimated levels of production associated with our re-entry into libya. some factors which could affect the timing of completion of the gudrun appraisal well, the possible development of blocks 31 and 32, the timing and production levels of the neptune development, the perseus discovery, the alvheim/vilje development and estimated levels of production in libya include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, inability or delays in obtaining necessary government or third-party approvals or permits, timing of commencing production from new wells, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the estimated levels of production in libya and possible developments in blocks 31 and 32 could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 7 table of contents reserves at december 31, 2005, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled approximately

boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2005, less than 20 percent have been included as proved reserves for more than three years while approximately 18 percent were added during 2005. during 2005, we added net proved reserves of 282 million boe, excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while producing 124 million boe. these net additions included 165 million boe as a result of our re-entry into libya, 50 million boe of extensions, discoveries and other additions, and total revisions of 58 million boe. of the total net reserve additions, 215 million boe were proved developed and 67 million boe were proved undeveloped. additionally, we transferred 121 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed during 2005. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves, were $955 million, $708 million and $780 million. these amounts include our proportionate share of equity method investees costs incurred as these were costs necessary for the development of proved undeveloped reserves. as of december 31, 2005, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2006 through 2008 are projected to be $868 million, $340 million and $175 million. 8 table of contents the alba field in equatorial guinea had the most significant positive revisions, totaling 47 million boe. of this volume, 21 million boe was added due to the progress on the equatorial guinea lng project, which will provide a market for the alba field natural gas reserves sooner and to a greater extent under the current production sharing contract than was expected when proved reserves were estimated at the end of 2004. at the end of 2005, our total proved reserves associated with the alba field offshore equatorial guinea totaled 505 million boe, or 39 percent of our total proved reserves. the above estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves and timing of production from development projects are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. for additional details of estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves on pages f-46 through f-47. we filed reports with the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) for the years 2004 and 2003 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and natural gas reserves. we will file a similar report for 2005. the year-end estimates reported to the doe are the same as the estimates reported in the supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements. in alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with local utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 152 bcf of natural gas over the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2018. during 2005, we entered into another agreement with a local utility company which, pending regulatory commission of alaska approval, will obligate us to supply approximately 60 bcf of natural gas between 2009 and 2018. in addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska lng plant and a proportionate share of the long-term lng sales obligation to two japanese utility companies. this obligation is estimated to total 62 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates in 2009. these commitments are structured with variable-pricing terms. our production from various natural gas fields in the cook inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. our proved reserves in the cook inlet are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. in the u.k., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 190 bcf of natural gas through the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2009. our brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. pricing under these natural gas sales contracts is variable. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contracts. 9 table of contents oil and natural gas net sales the following tables set forth daily average

llc ( ssa ) and marathon pipe line llc. refining we own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 974,000 barrels of crude oil per day. the table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our refineries as of december 31, 2005: crude oil refining capacity (barrels per day) garyville, louisiana 245,000 catlettsburg, kentucky 222,000 robinson, illinois 192,000 detroit, michigan 100,000 canton, ohio 73,000 texas city, texas 72,000 st. paul park, minnesota 70,000 total 974,000 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low sulfur gasolines. our refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect the refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. we increased our overall crude oil refining capacity during 2005 from 948,000 bpd to 974,000 bpd after completing the expansion project at our detroit refinery. this expansion increased crude oil capacity at detroit from 74,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd. the project also improves operating efficiency and enables the detroit refinery to meet new lower gasoline and diesel sulfur specifications. during 2005, we announced plans to evaluate a 180,000 bpd expansion of our garyville refinery. the initial phase of the potential expansion includes front-end engineering and design ( feed ) work which began in december 2005 and could lead to the start of construction in 2007. the project, estimated to cost approximately $2.2 billion, could be completed as early as the fourth quarter of 2009. the final investment decision is subject to completion of the feed work and the receipt of applicable permits. we also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. we manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax. during 2005, our refineries processed 973,000 bpd of crude oil and 205,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years: refined product yields (thousands of barrels per day) 2005 2004 2003 gasoline 644 608 567 distillates 318 299 284 propane 21

certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. we completed major turnarounds at our detroit and catlettsburg refineries in 2005. marketing in 2005, our refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 21.1 billion gallons (1,378,000 bpd). the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 71 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2005, excluding sales related to matching buy/sell transactions. approximately 53 percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 91 percent of our distillate sales volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis. approximately half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the united states and canada, with pitch products also being exported worldwide. we market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast. our customer base includes approximately 830 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. the following table sets forth our refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 2005 2004 2003 gasoline 836 807 776 distillates 385 373 365 propane 22 22

parts of our marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin. we also sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. as of december 31, 2005, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,000 marathon branded retail outlets located primarily in michigan, ohio, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in florida, georgia, minnesota, wisconsin, west virginia, tennessee, virginia, north carolina, pennsylvania, alabama and south carolina. ssa sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated retail outlets. as of december 31, 2005, ssa had 1,638 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names speedway and superamerica. ssa revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.5 billion in 2005, compared with $2.3 billion in 2004. profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. ssa also operates 60 valvoline instant oil change retail outlets located in michigan and northwest ohio. pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ), our joint venture with pilot corporation ( pilot ), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with approximately 260 locations in 37 states at december 31, 2005. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand-name restaurants. pilot and marathon each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. our marketing strategy is focused on ssa midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. 14 table of contents supply and transportation we obtain the crude oil we process from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. in 2005, our net purchases of u.s. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged 447,000 bpd, or 46 percent of crude oil processed, including a net 12,000 bpd from our production operations. in 2005, canada was the source for 11 percent, or 111,000 bpd, of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 43 percent, or 415,000 bpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including approximately 221,000 bpd from the middle east. this crude was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. we operate a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing areas. at december 31, 2005, we owned or leased approximately 2,774 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,824 miles of refined product trunk lines. at december 31, 2005 we had interests in the following pipelines: 100 percent ownership of ohio river pipe line llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio, known as cardinal products pipeline; 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting gulf coast refineries with the midwest market; 51 percent interest in loop llc ( loop ), which is the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois; 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, which is a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest; 33 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of mpc st. paul park, minnesota refinery; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana to north muskegon, michigan; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois to toledo, ohio. our 85 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeast. these facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. our marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. we also lease and own rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors and tank trailers. effective october 15, 2006, most of the diesel fuel sold for highway use must contain no more than 15 parts per million of sulfur at the retail outlet. this new ultra low sulfur diesel ( ulsd ) fuel requirement will place a premium on ensuring that there is no contamination of the ulsd while it is in transit to the retail outlet. we expect to be able to meet these requirements. the above discussion of the rm t segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the possible expansion of the garyville refinery. some factors that could affect the garyville expansion project include the results of the feed work, necessary regulatory approvals, crude oil supply and transportation logistics, necessary permits and continued favorable investment climate, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 15 table of contents integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations, methanol operations, certain other gas processing facilities and pipeline operations, and marketing and transportation of natural gas. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects. alaska lng we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, the lng has been sold under a long-term contract with two of japan largest utility companies. this contract continues through march 2009, with 2005 lng deliveries totaling 65 gross bcf (22 net bcf). equatorial guinea lng project in 2004, we and our partner, compania nacional de petroleos de guinea ecuatorial ( gepetrol ), the national oil company of equatorial guinea, through equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ), began construction of an lng plant on bioko island that will initially deliver a contracted offtake of 3.4 million metric tons per year beginning in 2007 (approximately 460 mmcfd) under a sales and purchase agreement with a subsidiary of bg group plc ( bgml ). bgml will purchase the lng plant production for a period of 17 years on an fob bioko island basis with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. the lng plant is ultimately expected to have the ability to operate at higher rates and for a longer period than the current contracted offtake rate and term. this project will allow us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the plant will be purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. construction of the plant is ahead of schedule with first shipment of lng expected in the third quarter of 2007. on july 25, 2005, marathon and gepetrol entered into agreements under which mitsui co., ltd. ( mitsui ) and a subsidiary of marubeni corporation ( marubeni ) acquired 8.5 percent and 6.5 percent interests, respectively, in egholdings. following the transaction, we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, with gepetrol holding a 25 percent interest and mitsui and marubeni holding the remaining interests. the egholdings partners are also exploring the feasibility of adding a second lng train in an effort to create a regional gas hub that would commercialize stranded natural gas from various sources in the surrounding gulf of guinea region. elba island lng in april 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes as part of our elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal capacity rights agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we can supply up to 58 billion cubic feet of natural gas (as lng) per year into the terminal through 2021 with a possible extension to 2023. in september 2004, we signed an agreement with bp energy company ( bp ) under which bp will supply us with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years. the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement with bp enables us to fully utilize our capacity rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of the bp contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. methanol we own a 45 percent interest in atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ), which owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the alba field. methanol sales totaled 1,052,000 gross metric tons (473,000 net metric tons) in 2005. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. ampco will undergo a scheduled maintenance shutdown during the second quarter of 2006. during the outage, ampco will also seek to remove bottlenecks in several parts of the plant. natural gas marketing and transportation activities in addition to the sale of our own natural gas production, we purchase gas from third-party producers and marketers for resale. 16 table of contents during 2005, we sold our 24 percent interest in nautilus pipeline company, llc and our 24 percent interest in manta ray offshore gathering company, llc, which are both gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems. we still own a 34 percent interest in the neptune natural gas processing plant located in st. mary parish, louisiana. the plant has the capacity to process 600 mmcfd of natural gas, which is supplied by the nautilus pipeline system. gas technology we invest in gas technology research, including gas-to -liquids ( gtl ) technology which was successfully applied in a gtl demonstration plant at the port of catoosa, oklahoma in 2004. in addition to gtl, we are continuing to explore gas technologies including methanol to power, gas to fuels and compressed natural gas technologies. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of production associated with the lng plant and the possible expansion thereof. factors that could affect the lng plant include, unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. in addition to these factors, other factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the current lng project and the development of additional lng capacity through additional projects include partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies, as well as national oil companies, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and natural gas. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to -work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, we believe we currently rank ninth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2005. we compete in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products. we believe we compete with about 30 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; nine refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 220 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway tm . we also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in ptc. our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. 17 table of contents as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. effective january 31, 2006, thomas j. usher retired as chairman of the board of directors and as a director of united states steel, and dr. shirley ann jackson retired as a director of united states steel. as a result, three remaining members of our board of directors are also directors of united states steel. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all marathon principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by marathon: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for marathon discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. united states steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed lease obligations. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee marathon provided with respect to all united states steel obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. 18 table of contents tax sharing agreement marathon and united states steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. provisions of this agreement include the following: for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before december 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between marathon and united states steel generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation; no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after december 31, 2001; and provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free transaction and limitations on post-separation activities that might jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation. under the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation: the taxes payable by each of the marathon group and the u.s. steel group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return; and the u.s. steel group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable. in accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the separation, marathon made a preliminary settlement with united states steel of approximately $440 million as the net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended december 31, 2001 under the pre-separation tax sharing principles. the tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended before december 31, 2001. in the tax sharing agreement, each of marathon and united states steel promised the other party that it: would not, before january 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation; and would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from the separation ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction. the prescribed actions and transactions include: the liquidation of marathon or united states steel; and the sale by marathon or united states steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business. in case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability. even if the separation otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code, the separation may become taxable to marathon under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either marathon or united states steel is acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the separation. for this purpose, a 50 percent or greater interest means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. to minimize this risk, both marathon and united states steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their equity structures that could cause the separation to be treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the internal revenue code may apply. if an acquisition occurs that results in the separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that acquisition transaction. although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the separation, each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the separation, is jointly and severally liable under the internal revenue code for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes 19 table of contents indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. marathon can provide no assurance, however, that united states steel will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2005 see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel for a discussion of marathon obligations associated with the separation. environmental matters we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors. our corporate responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. the corporate responsibility management committee, which is comprised of certain of our officers, is charged with reviewing our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving marathon or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies and legal proceedings. air of particular significance to our refining operations are u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. our combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. costs incurred through december 31, 2005 were approximately $825 million, with the remainder expected to be incurred in 2006. this is a forward-looking statement. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include completion of construction and start-up activities. the epa has finalized new and revised national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions (pm2.5) and ozone. in connection with these new standards, the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, in january 2004, the epa proposed a rule called the interstate air quality rule ( iaqr ) that would require significant reductions of so 2 and nox emissions in numerous states. the final rule was promulgated on may 12, 2005, and the rule was renamed the clean air interstate rule ( cair ). while the epa expects that states will meet their cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units ( egus ), states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. our refinery operations are located in affected states and some states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair requirements; however we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the states have taken further action. 20 table of contents water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. as of december 31, 2005, all of the barges used for river transport of our feedstocks and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at some of our rm t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. ongoing rcra-related costs are not expected to be material. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. employees we had 27,756 active employees as of december 31, 2005. of that number, 18,257 were employees of speedway superamerica llc, most of which were employed at retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2009. the same union represents certain hourly employees at our texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2009. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2006 at our st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2007 at our detroit refinery. available information general information about marathon, including the corporate governance principles and charters for the audit committee, compensation committee, corporate governance and

table of contents item 1a. risk factors " --> item 1a. risk factors marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. the following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices would reduce our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth. prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and refined products. historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of oil, natural gas and refined products are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil and natural gas; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions; and domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes. the long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil and natural gas are uncertain. lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we produce, which may reduce our revenues and operating income. significant reductions in oil and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures. estimates of oil and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our oil and natural gas reserves. the proved oil and natural gas reserve information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. those estimates were prepared by our personnel and reviewed, on a selected basis, by third-party petroleum engineers. the estimates were calculated using oil and natural gas prices in effect as of december 31, 2005, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. any significant future price changes may have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of oil and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves included in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by generally accepted accounting principles, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based generally on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. 22 table of contents if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future oil and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and natural gas is produced. increases in crude oil prices and environmental regulations may reduce our refined product margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall rm t profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refined product margins have been historically volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. in addition, environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on refining and marketing operations, which may reduce our refined product margins. if we do not compete successfully with our competitors, our future operating performance and profitability could materially decline. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies, as well as national oil companies, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. in addition, in implementing our integrated gas strategy, we compete with major integrated energy companies in bidding for and developing liquefied natural gas projects, which are very capital intensive. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional properties and bidding for and developing additional projects, such as lng plants. many of our larger competitors in the lng market can complete more projects than we have the capacity to complete, which could lead those competitors to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. in addition, many of our larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas, such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on each of our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of their operating facilities, marketing area and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures or may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement action against us. our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. 23 table of contents worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability. local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. approximately 50 percent of our oil and natural gas production in 2005 was derived from production outside the united states and approximately 70 percent of our proved reserves as of december 31, 2005 were located outside the united states. in addition, we are increasing the focus of our development operations on areas outside the united states. there are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation or may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could cause a downturn in the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. more specifically, these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverages that we consider adequate. actions of the united states government through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and overseas. the united states government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various countries. actions by both the united states and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and maritime accidents. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling and production and could materially reduce our profitability. if ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland. as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland, marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) for tax years of ashland still open as of the date we completed the transactions. we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to ashland interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions. however, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service. if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland. in that event, our 24 table of contents indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland. marathon is required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland, which could be material. we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions. under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two baskets, as described below: basket one this applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland. the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one. upon specified events related to ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two. in addition, basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two. because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland pre-transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two. the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a with and without basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group. thus, if the marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland. because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group tax liability for a particular year. this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation, ashland is required to repay such compensation to marathon. in the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of the interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court may review our recently completed transactions with ashland under the fraudulent transfer provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland. under the u.s. bankruptcy code and the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or, in some jurisdictions, less than fair consideration or valuable consideration; and 25 table of contents the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. in connection with our recently completed transactions with ashland, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland shareholders. in order to help establish that ashland nevertheless received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired. we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. those opinions were based on specific information provided to it and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to ashland existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) ashland receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) ashland solvency, it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon, united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $597 million as of december 31, 2005, including accrued interest of $9 million. if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel. in that event, our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel. under applicable law and regulations, we also may be liable for any defaults by united states steel in the performance of its obligations to pay federal income taxes, fund its erisa pension plans and pay other obligations related to periods prior to the effective date of the separation. united states steel has non-investment grade credit ratings and has granted security interests in some of its assets. the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. if the transfer of ownership of various assets and operations by marathon former parent entity to marathon was held to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, united states steel creditors may be able to obtain recovery from us or other relief detrimental to the holders of our common stock. in july 2001, usx corporation ( old usx ) effected a reorganization of the ownership of its businesses in which it created marathon as its publicly owned parent holding company and transferred ownership of various assets and operations to marathon, and it merged into a newly formed subsidiary which survived as united states steel. if a court in a bankruptcy case regarding united states steel or a lawsuit brought by its creditors or their representative were to find that, under the applicable fraudulent conveyance or transfer law: the transfer by old usx to marathon or related transactions were undertaken by old usx with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its existing or future creditors; or old usx received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration, or no value or consideration, in connection with those transactions, and either it or united states steel was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of those transactions, 26 table of contents was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature, then that court could determine those transactions entitled one or more classes of creditors of united states steel to equitable relief from us. such a determination could permit the unpaid creditors to obtain recovery from us or could result in other actions detrimental to the holders of our common stock. the measure of insolvency for purposes of these considerations would vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. item 1b. unresolved staff comments " --> item 1b. unresolved staff comments as of the date of this filing, we have no unresolved comments from the staff of the securities and exchange commission. item 2. properties " --> item 2. properties the location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of marathon have been described previously. except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency. at the date of acquisition of important properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. the properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim. the basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves on pages f-46 through f-47. property, plant and equipment additions for property, plant and equipment additions, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity capital expenditures. item 3. legal proceedings " --> item 3. legal proceedings marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. certain of these matters are included below. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. however, management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably. natural gas royalty litigation marathon was served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and indian lessees violated the false claims act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. the first case, u.s. ex rel jack j. grynberg v. alaska pipeline co., et al is primarily a gas measurement case and the second case, u.s. ex rel harrold e. wright v. agip petroleum co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. these cases assert that false claims have been filed by lessees and that penalties, damages and interest total more than $25 billion. the department of justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including marathon. in the grynberg case, the parties have briefed and argued their motions 27 table of contents regarding whether the district court should adopt the recommendations of the magistrate which would dismiss marathon and many other defendants on jurisdictional grounds. the wright case is in the discovery phase. marathon intends to continue to vigorously defend these cases. powder river basin litigation the u.s. bureau of land management ( blm ) completed multi-year reviews of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin, including those in wyoming. the blm signed a record of decision ( rod ) on april 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane development. plaintiff environmental and other groups filed suit in may 2003 in federal court against the blm to stop coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin until the blm conducted additional environmental impact studies. marathon intervened as a party in the ongoing litigation before the wyoming federal district court. as these lawsuits to delay energy development in the powder river basin progress through the courts, the wyoming blm continues to process permits to drill under the rod. in may 2004, plaintiff environmental groups environmental defense et al filed suit against the u.s. blm in montana federal district court, alleging the agency did not adequately consider air quality impacts of coal bed methane and oil and gas operations in the powder river basin in montana and wyoming when preparing its environmental impact statements. plaintiffs request that the blm be ordered to cease issuing leases and permits for energy development, until additional analysis of predicted air impacts is conducted. marathon and its subsidiary pennaco energy, inc. intervened in this litigation. mtbe litigation marathon is a defendant along with many other refining companies in over 40 cases in 11 states alleging methyl tertiary-butyl ether ( mtbe ) contamination in groundwater. all of these cases have been consolidated in a multi-district litigation in the southern district of new york for preliminary proceedings. the judge in this multi-district litigation ruled on april 20, 2005 that some form of market share liability would apply. market share liability enables a plaintiff to sue manufacturers who represent a substantial share of a market for a particular product and shift the burden of identification of who actually made the product to the defendants, effectively forcing a defendant to show that it did not produce the mtbe which allegedly caused the damage. the judge further allowed cases to go forward in new york and 11 other states, based upon varying theories of collective liability, and predicted that a new theory of market share liability would be recognized in connecticut, indiana and kansas. the plaintiffs generally are water providers or governmental authorities and they allege that refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing mtbe are liable for manufacturing a defective product and that owners and operators of retail gasoline sites have allowed mtbe to be discharged into the groundwater. several of these lawsuits allege contamination that is outside of marathon marketing area. a few of the cases seek approval as class actions. many of the cases seek punitive damages or treble damages under a variety of statutes and theories. marathon stopped producing mtbe at its refineries in october 2002. the potential impact of these recent cases and future potential similar cases is uncertain. the company will defend these cases vigorously. acquisition litigation on april 8, 2005, shiva singh instituted a class action in the supreme court of the state of new york in new york county against ashland, and the individual members of ashland board of directors. the complaint also named marathon, mpc and credit suisse first boston llc ( csfb ) as defendants. the complaint stated that mr. singh held ashland common stock and that the complaint was brought on behalf of mr. singh and others similarly situated. the action arose from the transaction proposed at that time in which ashland would transfer its entire 38 percent interest in mpc as well as certain other businesses to marathon. the complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty as well as aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against ashland, its directors, marathon and mpc. the complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty and negligence as well as aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against csfb. on september 20, 2005, the federal judge entered an order dismissing certain of the plaintiff negligence claims against csfb and the aiding and abetting claims against all defendants and directed the court clerk to mark the case closed. this case is not currently pending. product contamination litigation a lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia and alleges that marathon catlettsburg refinery sold defective gasoline to wholesalers and retailers, causing permanent damage to storage tanks, dispensers and related equipment, resulting in lost profits, business disruption, and 28 table of contents personal and real property damages. plaintiffs seek class action status. in 2002, mpc conducted extensive cleaning operations at affected facilities but denies that any permanent damages resulted from the incident. mpc previously settled with many of the potential class members in this case and intends to vigorously defend this action. environmental proceedings the following is a summary of proceedings involving marathon that were pending or contemplated as of december 31, 2005 under federal and state environmental laws. except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management belief set forth in the first paragraph under item 3. legal proceedings above takes such matters into account. claims under cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. potentially responsible parties ( prps ) for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. liability is strict and can be joint and several. because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with cercla. projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. at december 31, 2005, marathon had been identified as a prp at a total of seven cercla waste sites. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with six of these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000. marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under $3 million. in addition, there is one site where marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. there are also 123 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 29 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 51 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site and 18 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site. nine sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site and there are 16 sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs. there is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the michigan department of environmental quality ( mdeq ) at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near muskegon, michigan. during the next five years, marathon anticipates spending approximately $5 million at this site. appropriate site characterization and risk-based assessments necessary for closure will be refined during 2006 and may change the estimated future expenditures for this site. the closure strategy being developed for this site and ongoing work at the site are subject to approval by the mdeq. expenditures in 2005 were approximately $540,000, with expenditures in 2006 expected to be $1 million. mpc has had a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general office since 2002 concerning its self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its robinson, illinois refinery. mpc anticipates more discussions with illinois officials in 2006. in august of 2004, the west virginia department of environmental protection ( wvdep ) submitted a draft consent order to mpc regarding its handling of alleged hazardous waste generated from tank cleanings in the state of west virginia. the proposed order sought a civil penalty of $337,900. mpc resolved this matter in 2005 by entering an administrative order with wvdep where no civil penalty was imposed but mpc agreed to pay $95,297 as an administrative settlement, a contribution to the state department of natural resources for park remediation efforts unrelated to this matter and a reimbursement of wvdep costs. 29 table of contents sec investigation relating to equatorial guinea by letter dated july 15, 2004, the united states securities and exchange commission ( sec ) notified marathon that it was conducting an inquiry into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea, or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea. this inquiry followed an investigation and public hearing conducted by the united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, which reviewed the transactions of various foreign governments, including that of equatorial guinea, with riggs bank. the investigation and hearing also reviewed the operations of u.s. oil companies, including marathon, in equatorial guinea. there was no finding in the subcommittee report that marathon violated the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or any other applicable laws or regulations. marathon has been voluntarily producing documents requested by the sec in that inquiry. on august 1, 2005, marathon received a subpoena issued by the sec pursuant to a formal order of investigation requiring the production of the documents that have already been produced or that are in the process of being identified and produced in response to the sec prior requests, and requesting additional materials. marathon has been and intends to continue cooperating with the sec in this investigation. item 4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders " --> item 4.

reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in selected quarterly financial data (unaudited) on page f-42. as of january 31, 2006, there were 67,230 registered holders of marathon common stock. the board of directors intends to declare and pay dividends on marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of marathon oil corporation, although it has no obligation under delaware law or the restated certificate of incorporation to do so. in determining its dividend policy with respect to marathon common stock, the board will rely on the consolidated financial statements of marathon. dividends on marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of marathon. the following table provides information about purchases by marathon and its affiliated purchaser during the quarter ended december 31, 2005 of equity securities that are registered by

6. selected financial data " --> item 6. selected financial data see page f-52. item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations " --> item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states; and worldwide marketing and transportation of natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item 1. business, item 1a. risk factors, item 6. selected financial data and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. e p segment income during 2005 was up approximately 76 percent from 2004 levels, impacted by higher product prices as discussed above and increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. we estimate that our 2006 production available for sale will average approximately 365,000 to 395,000 boe per day, excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. this includes an estimated 40,000 to 45,000 boe per day as a result of our return to operations in the waha concessions in libya. with the developments we have under construction, we estimate our production will grow to 475,000 to 525,000 boe per day by 2008, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. projected production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic 31 table of contents considerations. these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been driven by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in economic activity and political developments in the world major oil and gas producing areas, including opec member countries. any substantial decline in such prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. a decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development. refining, marketing and transportation we refine, market and transport crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains and southeastern united states. rm t segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing margin, refinery throughputs, retail marketing margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations. the refining and wholesale marketing margin is the difference between the wholesale prices of refined products sold and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks refined, the cost of purchased products and manufacturing costs. we purchase crude oil to satisfy our refineries throughput requirements. as a result, our refining and wholesale marketing margin could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. the crack spread, which is generally a measure of the difference between spot market gasoline and distillate prices and spot market crude costs, is an industry indicator of refining margins. in addition to changes in the crack spread, our refining and wholesale marketing margin is impacted by the types of crude oil we process, the wholesale selling prices we realize for all the products we sell and our level of manufacturing costs. we process significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances our competitive position in the industry as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. over the last three years, approximately 60 percent of the crude oil throughput at our refineries has been sour crude oil. as the largest u.s. producer of asphalt, our refining and wholesale marketing margin is significantly impacted by the selling price of asphalt. sales of asphalt increase during the highway construction season in our market area, which is typically in the second and third quarters. the selling price of asphalt is dependent on the cost of crude oil, the price of alternative paving materials and the level of construction activity in both the private and public sectors. finally, our refining and wholesale marketing margin is impacted by changes in manufacturing costs from period to period, which are primarily driven by the level of maintenance activities at the refineries, and the price of purchased natural gas. our refining and wholesale marketing margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in our various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the expectations regarding the adequacy of the supply of refined products and raw materials. for information on price risk management, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our retail marketing margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the wholesale cost of the refined products, including secondary transportation, also plays an important part in rm t profitability. factors affecting our retail gasoline and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross margin from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in our marketing areas. the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through the pipelines. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the throughput of the refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september, and declines during the fall and winter months. the seasonal pattern for distillates is the reverse of this, helping to level overall variability on an annual basis. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. integrated gas our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand. lng, particularly in regard to our operations in equatorial guinea, is a key component of that integrated gas strategy. our integrated gas operations include 32 table of contents marketing and transportation of natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. also included in the financial results of the ig segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects. the profitability of these operations depends largely on commodity prices, volume deliveries, margins on resale gas, and demand. methanol spot pricing is volatile largely because global methanol demand is only 33 million tons and any major unplanned shutdown of or addition to production capacity can have a significant impact on the supply-demand balance. 2005 operating highlights we achieved exploration success with eight discoveries from 11 significant wells. we strengthened core e p areas by: re-entering our operations in libya; completing the equatorial guinea liquefied petroleum gas plant expansion project; progressing the alvheim development offshore norway to 43 percent completion; and obtaining approval for the neptune development in the deepwater gulf of mexico. we added net proved oil and natural gas reserves of 282 million boe, excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while producing 124 million boe during 2005. over the past three years, we have added net proved reserves of 675 million boe, excluding dispositions of approximately 277 million boe, while producing approximately 385 million boe. we strengthened our rm t business by: acquiring full ownership of our rm t operations, with our acquisition of the 38 percent interest previously held by ashland; completing the 26,000 bpd expansion of our detroit refinery; and initiating feed work for a potential 180,000 bpd expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery. we achieved same store merchandise sales growth of 11.7 percent at speedway superamerica in 2005, which is the third consecutive year of double digit merchandise sales growth, and same store gasoline sales volume growth of 4.0 percent, which is the fourth consecutive year of better than one percent volume growth. we advanced our integrated gas strategy by: accelerating the eg lng plant construction, such that the project is 66 percent complete at the end of 2005 with the first lng shipments projected for the third quarter of 2007; and initiating an lng supply contract to utilize our elba island, georgia re-gasification terminal access rights. we increased the quarterly dividend 18 percent to 33 cents per share. critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected 33 table of contents future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, economic and political conditions change. during 2005, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 58 million boe (five percent of the beginning-of -the-year reserves estimate). positive revisions of 82 million boe were partially offset by 24 million boe in negative revisions. our estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates prepared by these teams are approved by members of our corporate reserves group. any revisions of proved reserves estimates in excess of 2.5 million boe on a total-field basis must be approved by the director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer. the corporate reserves group audits recent acquisitions of material fields and properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions. in addition, third-party consultants are engaged to audit reserve estimates with the stated objective of reviewing the top 80 percent of our reserves over a three-year period. third-party audits did not result in any significant changes to reserve estimates during 2005, 2004 and 2003. the reserves of the alba field offshore equatorial guinea comprise approximately 39 percent of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2005. the reserves of the waha concession in libya that were acquired at the end of 2005 comprise approximately 13 percent of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves at that date. the next five largest oil and gas producing asset groups the alvheim development offshore norway, the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom ( u.k. ), the kenai field in alaska, the petronius development in the gulf of mexico and the east kamennoye license in russia comprise a total of approximately 15 percent of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves. depreciation and depletion of producing oil and natural gas properties is determined by the units-of -production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved developed reserves. the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant. a five percent increase in the amount of oil and natural gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $6.04 per barrel to $5.75 per barrel, which would increase pretax income by approximately $36 million annually, based on 2005 production. a five percent decrease in the amount of oil and natural gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $6.04 per barrel to $6.36 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $40 million annually, based on 2005 production. fair value estimates we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, to assess impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and to record non-exchange traded derivative instruments. other items which require estimates of fair value include asset retirement obligations, guarantee obligations and stock-based compensation. under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. during 2005, we made two significant acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $3.153 billion that was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions. as of december 31, 2005, we have recorded goodwill of $1.307 billion. such goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below carrying value. the fair values used to allocate the purchase prices of acquisitions and to test goodwill for impairment are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future revenues and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. 34 table of contents long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for e p assets, refinery and associated distribution system level or pipeline system level for refining and transportation assets, or site level for retail stores. if the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. estimating the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas producing asset groups requires assumptions about matters such as future oil and natural gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas, expected field performance and the political environment in the host country. an impairment of any of our large oil and gas producing properties could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. we evaluate our unproved property investment for impairment based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an undiscounted future net cash flow approach. information such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage are also considered. the expected future cash flows from our rm t assets require assumptions about matters such as future product prices, future crude oil and other feedstock costs, estimated remaining lives of the assets and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets existing service potential. we did not have significant impairment charges during 2005 or 2003. during 2004, we recorded an impairment of $32 million related to unproved properties and $12 million related to producing properties primarily as a result of unsuccessful developmental drilling activity in russia. we record all derivative instruments at fair value. we have two long-term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the u.k. which are accounted for as derivative instruments. these contracts expire in september 2009. these contracts were entered into in the early 1990s in support of our investments in the east brae field and the sage pipeline. contract prices are linked to a basket of energy and other indices. the contract price is reset annually in october based on the previous twelve-month changes in the basket of indices. consequently, the prices under these contracts do not track forward natural gas prices. the fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price to the expected sales volumes for the next eighteen months under these contracts. adjustments to the fair value of these contracts result in non-cash charges or credits to income from operations. the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price may fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect income from operations. the non-cash losses related to changes in fair value recognized in income from operations were $386 million in 2005, $99 million in 2004, and $66 million in 2003. these effects are primarily due to the u.k. 18-month forward natural gas price curve strengthening 90 percent, 36 percent and 26 percent during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. as of december 31, 2005, we reported deferred tax assets of $1.782 billion, which represented gross assets of $2.409 billion net of valuation allowances of $627 million. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, we consider proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and natural gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies in the event the forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. 35 table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plans and our unfunded u.s. retiree health plans due to the different projected liability durations of nine years and 13 years. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary discount rate modeling tool. this tool applies a yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical aa yield curve. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual discount rates from 1.5 to 30 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. each issue is required to have at least $150 million par value outstanding. the top quartile bonds are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield curve. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the funded u.s. pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our assumptions are compared to those of peer companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. note 23 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information for the three years ended december 31, 2005, on the components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense and the underlying assumptions. of the assumptions used to measure the december 31, 2005 obligations and estimated 2006 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit costs reported for the plans. a ..25 percent decrease in the discount rates of 5.50 percent for our domestic pension plan and 5.75 percent for our domestic postretirement benefit plan would increase pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by approximately $13 million and $3 million, respectively. in 2005, we decreased our retirement age assumption by two years and also increased our lump sum election rate from 90 percent to 96 percent based on changing trends in our experience. this change increased our benefit obligations by approximately $109 million. contingent liabilities we accrue contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. for instance, the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. we generally record these losses as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies, which are recorded as other taxes or provision for income taxes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions 36 table of contents and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. management discussion and analysis of income and operations revenues for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 e p $ 6,486 $ 4,996 $ 4,877 rm

increased by $1.490 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $119 million in 2004 from 2003. the 2005 increase was primarily due to higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes partially offset by lower domestic natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. derivative losses included in e p segment revenues totaled $5 million in 2005, $169 million in 2004 and $110 million in 2003. excluded from e p segment revenues were losses of $386 million in 2005, $99 million in 2004 and $66 million in 2003 related to long-term natural gas sales contracts in the u.k. that are accounted for as derivative instruments. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page 53. matching buy/sell transactions decreased by $44 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $55 million in 2004 from 2003. the 2005 and 2004 decreases were primarily due to decreased crude oil buy/sell volumes, partially offset by higher domestic liquid hydrocarbon prices. rm t segment revenues increased by $12.373 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $9.116 billion in 2004 from 2003. the 2005 increase primarily reflected higher refined product and crude oil prices and increased refined product sales volumes, partially offset by decreased crude oil sales volumes. the 2004 increase primarily reflected higher refined product and crude oil prices and increased refined product and crude oil sales volumes. matching buy/sell transactions increased by $3.438 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $2.114 billion in 2004 from 2003. the 2005 and 2004 increases were primarily due to increased crude oil prices and volumes and higher refined product prices and volumes. ig segment revenues increased by $345 million in 2005 from 2004 and decreased by $509 million in 2004 from 2003. the increase in 2005 is a result of higher natural gas prices. the decrease in 2004 is due to a decrease in natural gas marketing activities, partially offset by higher natural gas prices. derivative gains included in ig segment revenues totaled $13 million in 2005, compared to gains of $17 million in 2004 and $19 million in 2003. for additional information on segment results, see the discussion on income from operations on page 39. income from equity method investments increased by $96 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $141 million in 2004 from 2003. the increase in 2005 is primarily due to higher income from alba plant, llc as a result of higher lpg and condensate production volume and higher income from ptc as a result of higher distillate gross margins. the increase in 2004 resulted from a $124 million loss on the dissolution of mkm partners l.p. recorded in 2003. results for 2004 also include increased earnings of other equity method investments, primarily ampco. cost of revenues increased by $7.107 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $5.840 billion in 2004 from 2003. the increases are primarily in the rm t segment and resulted from an increase in acquisition costs for crude oil, an increase in the cost of refined product purchases, an increase in the cost of other refinery charge and blend stocks and higher manufacturing expenses, primarily the result of higher purchased energy and depreciation. purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions increased by $3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 and $1.837 billion in 2004 from 2003, primarily in the rm t segment. the increases in both years are primarily due to 37 table of contents increased crude oil prices. differences between revenues from matching buy/sell transactions and purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions are primarily grade/quality and location differentials. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $133 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $105 million in 2004 from 2003. the increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense due to the increase in the stock price during the year as well as an increase in equity-based awards. this was partially offset by a decrease as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004. the increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher costs associated with business transformation and outsourcing. our 2004 results were also impacted by the start-up costs discussed above and the increased cost of complying with governmental regulations. other taxes increased by $144 million in 2005 from 2004 and increased $39 million in 2004 from 2003. the increase in 2005 is primarily a result of increased payments of mineral extraction tax and export duty in russia due to higher sales volumes and crude oil prices. net interest and other financial costs decreased by $16 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $25 million in 2004 from 2003. the decrease in 2005 is primarily a result of increased interest income on higher average cash balances and capitalized interest, partially offset by increased interest on potential tax deficiencies and higher foreign exchange losses. the decrease in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income on higher cash balances. included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency losses of $17 million, and gains of $9 million and $13 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003. minority interest in income of mpc decreased by $148 million in 2005 from 2004 due to the acquisition of ashland 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30, 2005. provision for income taxes increased by $1.003 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $143 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to $2.797 billion and $388 million increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes. the effective tax rate for 2005 was 36.2 percent compared to 36.6 percent for both 2004 and 2003. the following is an analysis of the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2005 2004 2003 statutory tax rate 35.0

benefit of $8 million. also, included in 2003 results is an $8 million adjustment to a tax liability due to united states steel corporation. cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in 2005 was an unfavorable effect of $19 million, net of taxes of $12 million, representing the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation ( fin ) no. 47, accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. 143, as of december 31, 2005. the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2003 was a favorable effect of $4

(e) total average daily volumes of refined product sales to wholesale, branded and retail (ssa) customers. (f) sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. 40 table of contents domestic e p income increased by $491 million in 2005 from 2004 following a decrease of $82 million in 2004 from 2003. the increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices partially offset by lower sales volumes. the lower volumes in 2005 resulted primarily from weather-related downtime in the gulf of mexico and natural declines in field production rates. the decrease in 2004 was due to lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes primarily resulting from natural field declines, weather-related downtime in the gulf of mexico and the sale of the yates field in late 2003, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices. derivative losses totaled $5 million in 2005, compared to $118 million in 2004 and $91 million in 2003. our cost of storm-related repairs as a result of 2005 hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico was not significant. our gulf of mexico production has returned to pre-storm levels. in late september 2004, certain production platforms in the gulf of mexico were evacuated due to hurricane activity. all facilities were back on line by october 1, 2004 with the exception of the petronius platform which came back on line in march 2005. as a result of the damage to the petronius platform, we recorded expense of $11 million in 2004 representing repair costs incurred, partially offset by the net effects of the property damage insurance recoveries and the related retrospective insurance premiums. we recorded income of $53 million in 2005 and $34 million in 2004 for business interruption insurance recoveries. our domestic average realized liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $45.41 per barrel ( bbl ) in 2005, compared to $32.76 per bbl in 2004 and $27.02 per bbl in 2003. domestic average natural gas prices were $6.42 per thousand cubic feet ( mcf ) excluding derivative activity in 2005, compared with $4.89 per mcf in 2004 and $4.53 per mcf in 2003. domestic net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes decreased to 76 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ) in 2005, down 6 percent from 2004 primarily as a result of storm-related downtime in the gulf of mexico and natural field declines in the permian basin. domestic net natural gas sales volumes averaged 578 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ), down 8 percent from 2004, primarily as a result of lower production in the permian basin and camden hills in the gulf of mexico due to natural field declines and downtime associated with hurricane ivan. domestic net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes decreased 27 percent to 81 mbpd in 2004 from 2003 as a result of natural declines mainly in the gulf of mexico, hurricane damage to the petronius platform and the sale of the yates field in november 2003. domestic net natural gas sales volumes decreased 14 percent to 631 mmcfd in 2004 from 2003 as a result of hurricane damage to the petronius platform and natural declines in the permian basin and the gulf of mexico. international e p income increased by $801 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $198 million in 2004 from 2003. the increase in 2005 was primarily the result of higher product prices and liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, partially offset by higher production taxes in russia, dry well expenses and lower natural gas sales volumes. the increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and volumes partially offset by higher derivative losses. derivative losses totaled $386 million in 2005, compared to $51 million in 2004 and $19 million in 2003. our international average realized liquid hydrocarbon price excluding derivative activity was $45.43 per bbl in 2005, compared with $33.68 per bbl in 2004 and $26.24 per bbl in 2003. international average gas prices were $4.28 per mcf excluding derivative activity in 2005, compared with $3.33 per mcf in 2004 and $2.80 per mcf in 2003. international net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased to 115 mbpd in 2005, up 29 percent from 2004, as a result of increased production in equatorial guinea and russia. international net natural gas sales volumes averaged 354 mmcfd in 2005, down 4 percent from 2004, primarily as a result of reduced u.k. spot gas sales. international net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased 11 percent to 89 mbpd in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to increased production in equatorial guinea and a full year of production from khanty mansiysk oil corporation ( kmoc ) which was acquired in 2003. international net natural gas sales volumes averaged 368 mmcfd, up 1 percent from 2003 due to increased production from the condensate expansion project in equatorial guinea, offset by the disposition in 2003 of our interest in clam. rm t segment income increased by $1.607 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $587 million in 2004 from 2003. the increases were primarily due to higher refining and wholesale marketing margins. the refining and wholesale marketing margin in 2005 averaged 15.8 cents per gallon, versus a 2004 level of 8.8 cents and a 2003 level of 6.0 cents. margins improved initially in 2005 due to wider sweet/sour crude differentials, and more recently, due to the temporary impact that hurricanes katrina and rita had on refined product margins and concerns about the adequacy of distillate supplies heading into winter. margins improved initially in 2004 due to the market concerns about refiners ability to supply the new tier ii low sulfur gasolines which were required effective january 1, 2004. we also benefited from wider sweet/sour crude differentials in 2004. we averaged 973,000 barrels of crude oil throughput per day in 2005, or 102 percent of average system capacity. we averaged 939,000 barrels of crude oil throughput per day in 2004 and 917,000 in 2003, representing 99 percent and 98 percent of average system capacity for those years. 41 table of contents the portion of derivative losses included in the refining and wholesale marketing margin were $238 million in 2005 compared to $272 million in 2004 and $158 million in 2003. generally, losses on derivatives included in the refining and wholesale marketing margin are offset by gains on the underlying physical transactions. these derivative losses were primarily incurred to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories and to protect crack spread values. ig segment income decreased by $17 million in 2005 from 2004, following an increase of $51 million in 2004 from 2003. the decrease in 2005 was primarily due to increased income taxes for ampco as a result of the expiration of a tax holiday. the increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in ampco and higher income from our alaska lng operations, partially offset by costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects and lower margins from gas marketing activities, including recognized changes in the fair value of derivatives used to support those activities. additionally, the 2003 results included an impairment charge of $22 million on an equity method investment and a loss of $17 million on the termination of two operating leases for tankers used in our alaska lng operations. the ampco methanol plant in equatorial guinea operated at a 98 percent on-stream factor in 2005 and a 95 percent on-stream factor in 2004, and posted index prices for methanol remained strong. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity financial condition both our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc and our re-entry to libya discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements had a significant impact on our december 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet. the mpc transaction closed june 30, 2005 and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. as a result, we established a new accounting basis for the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of mpc to the extent of the 38 percent of mpc not previously owned by us, based on the estimated fair values of those net assets as of june 30, 2005. on december 29, 2005, we entered into an agreement with the national oil corporation of libya to return to our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the waha concessions in libya. this transaction was also accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. changes in the consolidated balance sheets from 2004 to 2005 were significantly impacted by the acquisitions noted above. for additional information on the effects of both of these transactions on our financial condition, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. other significant changes in the consolidated balance sheets are noted below. net property, plant and equipment increased $3.201 billion from year-end 2004 due to the acquisitions noted above as well as the projects in equatorial guinea and the alvheim development offshore norway affecting international e p, the detroit refinery expansion affecting rm t and the eg lng plant affecting ig. net property, plant and equipment for each of the last two years is summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2005 2004 e p domestic $ 2,799 $ 2,644 international 4,737 3,530 total e p 7,536 6,174 rm t 6,113 4,842 ig 1,157 621 corporate 205 173 total $ 15,011 $ 11,810 asset retirement obligations increased $234 million from year-end 2004 primarily due to upward revisions of previous estimates primarily in the u.k. and ireland, a change in the gabon production sharing contract that created a retirement obligation and adoption of fin no. 47 related to conditional asset retirement obligations on december 31, 2005. cash flows net cash provided from operating activities (for continuing operations) totaled $4.738 billion in 2005, compared with $3.766 billion in 2004 and $2.765 billion in 2003. the 2005 increase mainly resulted from higher net income, partially offset by the effects of receivables which were transferred to ashland at the acquisition date. the 2004 increase was primarily the result of working capital changes. 42 table of contents capital expenditures for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 e p domestic $ 637 $ 402 $ 344 international 823 542 629 total e p 1,460 944 973 rm t 841 794 789

increase in 2005 mainly resulted from increased spending in the e p segments related to the alvheim development offshore norway and in the ig segment associated with the eg lng plant. the increase of $338 million in 2004 from 2003 mainly resulted from increased spending in the ig segment associated with the eg lng plant. acquisitions included cash payments of $506 million in 2005 for the acquisition of ashland 38 percent ownership in mpc and $252 million in 2003 for the acquisition of kmoc. for further discussion of acquisitions, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. cash from disposal of assets was $131 million in 2005, compared with $76 million in 2004 and $1.256 billion in 2003 which includes the disposal of discontinued operations. in 2005 and 2004, proceeds were primarily from the sale of various domestic producing properties and ssa stores. in 2003, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of our e p properties in western canada, the yates field and gathering system, various ssa stores and other interests and producing properties. net cash used in financing activities totaled $2.345 billion in 2005, compared with net cash provided of $527 million in 2004 and net cash used of $888 million in 2003. the change from 2004 to 2005 was primarily related to the repayment of $1.920 billion of debt assumed as a part of the acquisition in 2005 and to the issuance of 34,500,000 shares of common stock on march 31, 2004, resulting in net proceeds of $1.004 billion in 2004. the change also included an increase in dividends paid and $272 million of distributions to the minority shareholder of mpc prior to the acquisition, net of an increase in contributions from the minority shareholders of egholdings. the increase in 2004 was due to the net proceeds from the common stock issuance discussed above as well as the suspension of distributions to the minority shareholder of mpc in 2004. this was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to stockholders. derivative instruments see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page 53, for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. dividends to stockholders dividends of $1.22 per common share or $436 million were paid during 2005. on january 29, 2006, our board of directors declared a dividend of 33 cents per share on our common stock, payable march 10, 2006, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 16, 2006. liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed credit facilities and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. our ability to access the debt capital market is supported by our investment grade credit ratings. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor corporation, moody investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+, baa1, and bbb+. because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including our capital spending programs, stock repurchase program, repayment of debt maturities for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008, and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. we have a committed $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that terminates in may 2009. at december 31, 2005, there were no borrowings against this facility. at december 31, 2005, we had no commercial 43 table of contents paper outstanding under our u.s. commercial paper program that is backed by the five-year revolving credit facility. mpc has a committed $500 million five-year revolving credit facility with third-party financial institutions that terminates in may 2009. at december 31, 2005, there were no borrowings against this facility. as a condition of the closing agreements for the acquisition, we are required to maintain mpc on a stand-alone basis financially for a two-year period. during this period of time, capital contributions into mpc are prohibited and mpc is prohibited from incurring additional debt, except for borrowings under an existing intercompany loan facility to fund an expansion project at mpc detroit refinery and in the event of limited extraordinary circumstances. mpc may only use its revolving credit facility for short-term working capital requirements in a manner consistent with past practices. there are no restrictions against mpc making intercompany loans or declaring dividends to its parent. we believe these facilities and cash provided from mpc operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity requirements. as of december 31, 2005, there was $1.7 billion aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities or other securities, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for other equity or debt securities available to be issued under the $2.7 billion universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in 2002. on june 30, 2005, we issued $955 million of common stock to ashland shareholders through a separate registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which was declared effective may 20, 2005. our cash-adjusted debt-to -capital ratio (total-debt-minus-cash to total-debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 11 percent at december 31, 2005, compared to 8 percent at year-end 2004 as shown below. this includes $543 million of debt that is serviced by united states steel. we continually monitor our spending levels, market conditions and related interest rates to maintain what we perceive to be reasonable debt levels. december 31 december 31 (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 long-term debt due within one year $ 315 $ 16 long-term

partners in the former oasis group, we entered into an agreement with the national oil corporation of libya to return to our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the waha concessions in libya. the re-entry terms include a 25-year extension of the concessions to 2030 through 2034 and a payment of $520 million from us, which was made in january 2006. an additional payment estimated to be approximately $212 million is payable by us within one year of the agreement date. on january 29, 2006, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock over a period of two years. such purchases will be made during this period as our financial condition and market conditions warrant. any purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. the repurchase program does not include specific price targets, and is subject to termination prior to completion. we will use cash on hand, cash generated from operations, or cash from available borrowings to acquire shares. shares of stock repurchased under the program will be held as treasury shares. 44 table of contents the table below provides aggregated information on our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31, 2005: summary of contractual cash

(b) we anticipate cash payments for interest of $255 million for 2006, $432 million for 2007-2008, $385 million for 2009-2010 and $1.658 billion for the remaining years for a total of $2.730 billion. (c) the majority of contractual obligations to purchase crude oil, refinery feedstock and refined products as of december 31, 2005 relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of 2006. (d) we have acquired the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal. the agreement primary term ends in 2021. pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the lng re-gasification terminal. (e) service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (f) we are a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with alliance pipeline. this agreement is used by alliance pipeline to secure its financing. this arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our guarantee. (g) commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs. (h) we have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. we have estimated projected funding requirements through 2014. (i) includes $625 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. for additional information, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel on page 47. contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded from the above table. these include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors. note 23 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information for the three years ended december 31, 2005, on the funded status for our pension plans as of december 31, 2005 and 2004. under prescribed regulatory minimum funding requirements, we have satisfied the minimum funding obligations related to the pension plans and therefore no contributions are required from us. however, we plan to make discretionary cash contributions of between $155 million and $345 million in 2006. 45 table of contents our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. the forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or refining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations. off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources; and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. we have provided various forms of guarantees to unconsolidated affiliates, united states steel and certain lease contracts. these arrangements are described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. we are a party to an agreement that would require us to purchase, under certain circumstances, the interest in pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ) not currently owned. this put/call agreement is described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. nonrecourse indebtedness of investees certain of our investees have incurred indebtedness that we do not support through guarantees or otherwise. if we were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata ownership basis, our share would have been approximately $308 million as of december 31, 2005. of this amount, $183 million relates to ptc. if any of these investees default, we have no obligation to support the debt. our partner in ptc has guaranteed $125 million of the total ptc debt. obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary, united states steel, to holders of our usx u.s. steel group class of common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. united states steel obligations to marathon are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. if united states steel fails to satisfy these obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. as of december 31, 2005, we have identified the following obligations totaling $597 million that have been assumed by united states steel: $428 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $9 million at december 31, 2005. $66 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2005. 46 table of contents $49 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel clairton cokemaking facility, with a term extending to 2012. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2005. $45 million of operating lease obligations, of which $37 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee of all obligations of united states steel as general partner of clairton 1314b partnership, l.p. to the limited partners. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. for further discussion of the clairton 1314b guarantee, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $597 million, obligations of $552 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2005 (current portion $20 million; long-term portion $532 million). the remaining $45 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. the table below provides aggregated information on the portion of our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by united states steel as of december 31, 2005: summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel 2007- 2009- later (in millions) total

million for 2006, $47 million for 2007-2008, $47 million for 2009-2010 and $272 million for the later years to be assumed by united states steel. each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during taxable periods ended on or before december 31, 2001, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for those periods. marathon and united states steel have entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended on or before december 31, 2001. the agreement includes indemnification provisions to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party. in 2005, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement, we paid $6 million to united states steel in connection with the settlement with the internal revenue service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of usx corporation for the years 1995 through 1997. united states steel reported in its form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2005, that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. however, united states steel management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. transactions with related parties we own a 63 percent working interest in the alba field offshore eg. we own a 52 percent interest in an onshore lpg processing plant in eg through an equity method investee, alba plant llc. additionally, we own a 45 percent interest in an onshore methanol production plant through ampco, an equity method investee. we sell our marketed natural gas from the alba field to alba plant llc and ampco. ampco uses the natural gas to manufacture methanol and sells the methanol through another equity method investee, ampco marketing llc. sales to our 50 percent equity method investee, ptc, which consists primarily of refined petroleum products, accounted for less than two percent of our total sales revenue for 2005, 2004 and 2003. ptc is the largest travel center network in the united states and operates approximately 260 travel centers nationwide. we also sell refined petroleum products consisting mainly of petrochemicals, base lube oils, and asphalt to ashland which owned a 38 percent interest in mpc prior to the acquisition. our sales to ashland accounted for less than one percent of our total sales revenue for 2005, 2004 and 2003. we believe that these transactions were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. 47 table of contents marathon holds a 60 percent economic interest, gepetrol holds a 25 percent economic interest, mitsui holds an 8.5 percent economic interest and marubeni holds a 6.5 percent economic interest in egholdings. as of december 31, 2005, total expenditures of $1.116 billion, including $1.066 billion of capital expenditures, related to the lng project have been incurred. cash of $57 million held in escrow to fund future contributions from gepetrol is classified as restricted cash and is included in investments and long-term receivables. payables to related parties include $57 million payable to gepetrol. management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately recovered in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. our environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were (a) : (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 capital $ 390 $ 433 $ 331 compliance operating maintenance 250 215 243 remediation (b) 25 32 44 total $ 665 $ 680 $ 618 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 13 percent of total capital expenditures in 2005, 19 percent in 2004 and 17 percent in 2003. we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $218 million or 7 percent of capital expenditures in 2006. predictions beyond 2006 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $147 million in 2007; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. of particular significance to our refining operations are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and in 2006 for diesel fuel. our combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. costs incurred through december 31, 2005, were approximately $825 million, with the remainder expected to be incurred in 2006. this is a forward-looking statement. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include completion of construction and start-up activities. during 2001, mpc entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged caa and other violations with the epa covering all of mpc refineries. the settlement committed mpc to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to mpc refineries over approximately an eight-year period. the total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects are 48 table of contents approximately $420 million over the eight-year period, with about $265 million incurred through december 31, 2005. the impact of the settlement on ongoing operating expenses is expected to be immaterial. in addition, mpc has nearly completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations, at a cost of $9 million. we believe this settlement will provide mpc with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions. in 2005, mpc entered into two amendments of the consent decree which captured all revisions to the decree agreed to with the epa since 2001. the revisions related to use of additives and control technologies along with schedule adjustments and

environmental matters, see item 3. legal proceedings. outlook capital, investment and exploration budget we approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $3.4 billion for 2006, which includes budgeted capital expenditures of $3.2 billion. this represents a 13 percent increase over 2005 actual spending. the primary focus of the 2006 budget is to find additional oil and natural gas reserves, develop existing fields, strengthen rm t assets and continue implementation of the integrated gas strategy. the budget includes worldwide production capital spending of $1.357 billion primarily in the united states, norway, russia, equatorial guinea and ireland. the worldwide exploration budget of $588 million includes plans to drill 19 significant exploration wells. other activities will focus on projects primarily within or adjacent to our onshore producing properties in the united states. the budget includes $886 million for rm t, primarily for refining investments targeting value-added projects primarily aimed at de-bottlenecking various refining components to increase throughput capacity, as well as investments necessary to meet revised epa national ambient air quality standards, best achievable control technology and tier ii clean fuels regulations. also included in the budget for rm t is planned spending for the feed work being undertaken for the potential 180,000 bpd garyville, louisiana refinery expansion project. the ig budget of $341 million is primarily for the ongoing construction of the eg lng plant. the remaining $210 million balance is designated for capitalized interest and corporate activities. this budget does not include the 2006 cash payments related to our re-entry to libya, estimated to be $732 million. exploration and production our eight discoveries in 2005 resulted from our balanced exploration strategy which places an emphasis on near-term production opportunities, while retaining an appropriate exposure to longer-term options. major exploration activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include those in: offshore angola, where development options for the northeast area of block 31, which includes the plutao, saturno, marte and venus discoveries, are currently being evaluated. also on block 31 during 2005, the announcement of five discoveries, ceres, palas, juno, astraea and hebe, in the southeastern part of the block reinforce the likelihood of a second development area. the urano well was started in december 2005 and drilling is in progress. we own a 10 percent interest in block 31. we have secured rig capacity for and plan to participate in five exploration wells during 2006. on angola block 32, in which we own a 30 percent interest, three discoveries were announced, gindungo, canela and gengibre. we also participated in a well on the cola prospect that encountered hydrocarbons, but additional drilling will be required to determine commerciality. finally, we announced a successful appraisal of the gengibre discovery and the mostarda well has reached total depth. these results will be announced following government approval. we have secured rig capacity for and plan to participate in six exploration wells during 2006. equatorial guinea, where we are evaluating development scenarios for the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, one of which includes production through the alba field infrastructure and the future lng facility under construction on bioko island. we own a 63 percent interest in the alba block and serve as operator. norway, where we acquired four new norwegian exploration licenses (three operated) in the december 2004 apa license round. we now own interests in 16 licenses in the norwegian sector of the north sea and plan to drill one to two exploration wells during 2006. gulf of mexico, where we plan to participate in one to four wells during 2006. 49 table of contents during 2005, we continued to make progress in advancing key development projects that will help serve as the basis for our production growth profile in the coming years. major development and production activities currently underway or under evaluation include those in: libya, where we re-entered the waha concessions at the end of 2005 and have extended the licenses for an additional 25 years. in 2006 we will do more detailed analysis of work to be completed to maximize the potential of this major asset which currently produces 350,000 bpd gross and we expect to contribute 40,000 to 45,000 bpd net to marathon during 2006. we own a 16.33 percent interest in the approximately 13 million acre waha concessions. norway, where our alvheim development will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading ( fpso ) vessel with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. at year-end 2005 the project was 43 percent complete with production expected to start during the first quarter 2007. the alvheim development includes the kneler, boa and kameleon fields in which we own a 65 percent interest and serve as operator. a development plan for the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, was approved by the norwegian government in 2005. the combined alvheim/ vilje developments are expected to ramp up production in the first quarter of 2007 to more than 50,000 net boepd. also, results for the volund well (formerly hamsun) are being analyzed and development scenarios are being examined, including a possible tie-back to the alvheim development. we own a 65 percent interest in volund and serve as operator. gulf of mexico, where the neptune development was sanctioned during 2005 and which is on track for first production in late 2007 or early 2008. equatorial guinea, where we completed our lpg expansion project and ramped up liquids production to approximately 86,000 gross bpd (49,000 bpd net to marathon) by the end of 2005. we continue to exceed our initial liquids production projection, as gross production available for sale in january 2006 was approximately 90,000 bpd (51,000 bpd net to marathon). russia, where our successful drilling program in east kamennoye took our production to greater than 30,000 net bpd at year end, more than double the production level when we acquired the assets in 2003. in january 2006, we began to experience pipeline operational problems related to the increasing water production associated with the natural gas production from the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico. if these issues cannot be resolved, we may need to impair some or all of the carrying value of the field and the associated canyon express pipeline. at december 31, 2005, the combined carrying value of those assets approximated $20 million. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of our worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, future exploration and drilling activity, possible development of blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the neptune development, the alvheim/ vilje development and estimated levels of production in libya. some factors that could potentially affect this forward-looking information include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, occurrence of acquisitions/dispositions of oil and gas properties, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the estimated levels of production in libya and possible development of blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. refining, marketing and transportation throughout 2005, we remained focused on our strategy of leveraging refining and marketing investments in core markets, as well as expanding and enhancing our asset base while controlling costs. the record refinery throughput performance was achieved even though the garyville, louisiana and texas city, texas refineries were shut down briefly due to hurricanes katrina and rita. based on our current plans, we expect our 2006 average crude oil throughput to exceed that achieved in 2005. the detroit refinery expansion was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. this project increased the refinery crude processing capacity from 74,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd as well as enabled the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. the refinery ramped up to full capacity of 100,000 bpd in mid-november. we plan to evaluate a 180,000 bpd expansion of the 245,000 bpd garyville, louisiana refinery. the initial phase of the potential expansion includes feed work which began in december 2005 and could lead to the start of 50 table of contents construction in 2007. the project, currently estimated to cost approximately $2.2 billion, could be completed as early as the fourth quarter of 2009. the final investment decision is subject to completion of the feed work and the receipt of applicable permits. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to projections of crude oil throughput, the garyville, louisiana refinery expansion project, and other related businesses. some factors that could affect crude oil throughput include planned and unplanned refinery maintenance projects, the level of refining margins, and other operating considerations. the garyville refinery expansion project may be affected by the results of the feed work, necessary regulatory approvals, crude oil supply and transportation logistics, the receipt of applicable permits, continued favorable investment climate, as well as availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects once construction begins. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas construction of the eg lng plant is ahead of schedule with shipment of first cargoes of lng expected in the third quarter of 2007. this project is expected to be one of the lowest cost lng operations in the atlantic basin with an all-in lng operating, capital and feedstock cost of approximately $1 per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) at the loading flange of the lng plant. efforts are underway to acquire additional natural gas supply and expand the utilization of this lng facility above and beyond the contract to supply 3.4 million metric tons per year to bg gas marketing ltd. for 17 years. we also are seeking additional natural gas supplies in the area to expand the capacity and life of this plant and that could lead to the development of a second lng train. under the five-year bp supply agreement, bp will supply us with 58 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas per year, as lng. we will take delivery of the lng at the elba island terminal where we hold rights to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas per year, with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our capacity rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of the bp contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. in 2006, we plan to continue exploring and investing in gas technology research, including gtl technology, which was successfully applied in the catoosa gtl demonstration plant in 2004. in addition to gtl, we are continuing to explore gas technologies, including methanol to power, gas to fuels and compressed natural gas technologies. the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to a lng project and possible expansion thereof. factors that could affect the lng project and related facilities include unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. in addition to these factors, other factors that could affect the possible expansion of the lng project and the development of additional lng capacity through additional projects include partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. corporate higher foreign income taxes are expected to result from our libyan operations, where the effective tax rate is in excess of 90 percent, and an increase in the u.k. supplemental corporation tax rate from 10 percent to 20 percent effective january 1, 2006. also increasing our overall effective tax rate are the incremental taxes associated with the expected repatriation of foreign earnings to the u.s. since 2003, the variable component of our stock-based compensation awards has had a significant impact on our income from operations. we recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the difference between the market price and the grant price of these variable awards each reporting period until settlement. during 2005, we experienced a 66 percent increase in the market price of our common stock. as a result, we recognized $69 million in stock-based compensation expense compared to $30 million for 2004. due to exercises of these awards during 2005, the number of outstanding variable awards decreased approximately 74 percent. we expect that this change will reduce the impact these variable awards will have on stock-based compensation expense in 2006. 51 table of contents accounting standards not yet adopted in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 123(r) as a revision of sfas no. 123, accounting for stock-based compensation. this statement requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. in addition, awards classified as liabilities will be remeasured each reporting period. in 2003, we adopted the fair value method for grants made, modified or settled on or after january 1, 2003. accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of sfas no. 123(r) to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. the statement provided for an effective date of july 1, 2005, for us. however, in april 2005, the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule that, for us, defers the effective date until january 1, 2006. we adopted the provisions of this statement january 1, 2006. in november 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 151, inventory costs an amendment of arb no. 43, chapter 4. this statement requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and re-handling costs be recognized as a current-period charge. we are required to implement this statement in the first quarter of 2006. we do not expect the adoption of sfas no. 151 to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in may 2005, the fasb issued sfas no. 154, accounting changes and error corrections. sfas no. 154 requires companies to recognize (1) voluntary changes in accounting principle and (2) changes required by a new accounting pronouncement, when the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions, retrospectively to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. sfas no. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005. in september 2005, the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force regarding issue no. 04-13, accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty. the issue defines when a purchase and a sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same line of business is recorded at fair value or considered a single nonmonetary transaction subject to the fair value exception of apb opinion no. 29. the purchase and sale transactions may be pursuant to a single contractual arrangement or separate contractual arrangements and the inventory purchased or sold may be in the form of raw materials, work-in -process, or finished goods. in general, two or more transactions with the same party are treated as one if they are entered into in contemplation of each other. the rules apply to new arrangements entered into in reporting periods beginning after march 15, 2006. we are currently studying the provisions of this consensus to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements. in february 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 155, accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no. 133 and 140. sfas no. 155 simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments, eliminates the fasb interim guidance which provides that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets are not subject to the provisions of sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and eliminates the restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity may hold. sfas no. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity first fiscal year that begins after september 15, 2006. we are currently studying the provisions of this statement to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements. 52 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk " --> item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. we use commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. to a lesser extent, we are exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials, and purchases of ethanol. our strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. we use a variety of derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses. as market conditions change, we evaluate our risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of commodity-based derivatives will be based on market prices. our e p segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on portions of our future production when deemed advantageous to do so. we also use derivatives to protect the value of natural gas purchased and injected into storage in support of production operations. we use financial derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure on foreign currency denominated capital expenditures, operating expenses and tax payments. our rm t segment uses commodity derivative instruments: to mitigate the price risk: between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products, associated with anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use, associated with freight on crude oil, feedstocks and refined product deliveries, and on fixed price contracts for ethanol purchases; to protect the value of excess refined product, crude oil and lpg inventories; to protect margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers; to protect against decreases in future crack spreads; and to take advantage of trading opportunities identified in the commodity markets. our ig segment is exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas. we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes. we use financial derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure on foreign currency denominated capital expenditures. we use financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposures. as we enter into these derivatives, assessments are made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting. we believe that use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material risk. however, the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity. 53 table of contents commodity price risk sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations ( ifo ) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004, are provided in the following table: (a) (in millions) incremental decrease in ifo assuming a hypothetical price change of (a) 2005 2004 derivative commodity instruments (b)(c) 10% 25% 10% 25% crude oil (d) $ 11 (e) $ 25 (e) $ 1 (e) $ natural gas (d) 78 (e) 195 (e) 36 (e) 91 (e) refined products (d) 6 (e) 15 (e) 3 (f) 7 (f) (a) we remain at risk for future changes in the market value of derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. effects of these offsets are not reported in the sensitivity analyses. amounts assume hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in closing commodity prices, excluding basis swaps, for each open contract position at december 31, 2005 and 2004. the hypothetical price changes of 10 percent and 25 percent would result in incremental decreases in income from operations of $90 million and $225 million for 2005 and $48 million and $119 million for 2004 related to long-term natural gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and these amounts are included above in the impact for natural gas. we evaluate our portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. the creditworthiness of counterparties is reviewed continuously and master netting agreements are used when practical. changes to the portfolio after december 31, 2005, would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented in the table. (b) net open contracts for the combined e p and ig segments varied throughout 2005, from a low of 1,243 contracts at march 10 to a high of 2,192 contracts at january 20, and averaged 1,654 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the rm t segment varied throughout 2005, from a low of 3,621 contracts at december 19 to a high of 28,079 contracts at march 21, and averaged 18,401 for the year. the derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects. (c) the calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated. gains and losses on options are based on changes in intrinsic value only. (d) the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity is based on the largest incremental decrease in ifo when applied to the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge that commodity. (e) price increase. (f) price decrease. e p segment derivative losses included in the e p segment were $5 million in 2005 compared to $169 million in 2004 and $110 million in 2003. additionally, losses from discontinued cash flow hedges of $3 million are included in 2004 segment results, compared to losses of $8 million in 2003. the discontinued cash flow hedge amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur. excluded from the e p segment results were losses of $386 million in 2005, $99 million in 2004 and $66 million in 2003 on long-term gas contracts in the u.k. that are accounted for as derivative instruments. for additional information on u.k. gas contracts, see fair value estimates on page 34. during 2005, we have remained exposed to market prices of commodities. in 2004, we reduced our exposure to market prices of commodities on 26 percent of crude oil production and 7 percent of natural gas production. in 2003, we reduced our exposure to market prices of commodities on 25 percent of crude oil production and 22 percent of natural gas production. at december 31, 2005, we had no open derivative contracts related to our oil and gas production and therefore remain exposed to market prices of commodities. we continue to evaluate the commodity price risks related to our production and may enter into commodity derivative instruments when it is deemed advantageous. as a particular but not exclusive example, we may elect to use derivative instruments to achieve minimum price levels on some portion of our production to support capital or acquisition funding requirements. 54 table of contents rm t segment we do not attempt to qualify commodity derivative instruments used in our rm t operations for hedge accounting. as a result, we recognize in income all changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our rm t operations. derivative gains or losses included in rm t segment income for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: strategy (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 mitigate price risk $ (57 ) $ (106 ) $ (112 ) protect carrying values of excess inventories (118 ) (98 ) (57 ) protect margin on fixed price sales 18 8 5 protect crack spread values (81 ) (76 ) 6 subtotal non-trading activities (238 ) (272 ) (158 ) trading activities (87 ) 8 (4 ) total net derivative losses $ (325 ) $ (264 ) $ (162 ) derivatives used in non-trading activities have an underlying physical commodity transaction. derivative losses occur when market prices increase, and generally are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transactions. conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, and generally are offset by losses on the underlying physical commodity transactions. in 2005, we realized an $87 million loss on derivative instruments associated with trading activities primarily as a result of unanticipated changes in crude oil and refined product prices. ig segment we have used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. the underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. similarly, we will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term (typically less than a year) fixed price contracts to market prices in our ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. derivative gains included in ig segment income were $12 million in 2005, $17 million in 2004 and $19 million in 2003. trading activity in the ig segment resulted in losses of $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003 which have been included in the aforementioned amounts. other commodity risk we are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. for example, new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana henry hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices. if commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. these regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. over-the counter ( otc ) transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk. we are impacted by liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position. due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions. 55 table of contents interest rate risk we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations which affect the fair value of certain financial instruments. a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table: (in millions) december 31, 2005 december 31, 2004 incremental incremental fair increase in fair increase in value (b) fair value (c) value (b) fair value (c) financial assets (liabilities) (a) : investments and long-term receivables $ 268 $ $ 266 $ interest rate swap agreements (e) $ (30 ) $ 14 $ (10 ) $ 14 long-term debt (d)(e) $ (4,354 ) $ (152 ) $ (4,480 ) $ (164 ) (a) fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, commercial paper, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. (b) see note 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for carrying value of instruments. (c) for long-term debt, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of our long-term debt at december 31, 2005 and 2004. for interest rate swap agreements, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the effective swap rate at december 31, 2005 and 2004. (d) includes amounts due within one year and the effects of interest rate swaps. (e) fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. at december 31, 2005 and 2004, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. this sensitivity is illustrated by the $152 million increase in the fair value of long-term debt assuming a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates. however, our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio would unfavorably affect our results and cash flows only if we would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value. we manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio. we have entered into several interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. the following table summarizes, by individual debt instrument, the interest rate swap activity as of december 31, 2005: fixed rate to be notional swap floating rate to be paid received amount maturity fair value six month libor +4.226% 6.650 % $ 300 million 2006 $ (1) million six month libor +1.935% 5.375 % $ 450 million 2007 $ (8) million six month libor +3.285% 6.850 % $ 400 million 2008 $ (11) million six month libor +2.142% 6.125 % $ 200 million 2012 $ (10) million 56 table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward and option contracts, generally with terms of 365 days or less. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our exposure to movements in the foreign currency markets by locking in foreign currency rates. at december 31, 2005, the following currency derivatives were outstanding. all contracts currently qualify for hedge accounting unless noted. notional collar strike fair financial instruments period amount range (a) value (b) foreign currency rate option collars euro january 2006 june 2006 $ 81 million 1.17 1.22 (c) $ norwegian kroner january 2006 june 2006 $ 154 million 6.42 6.95 (d) $ (a) rates shown are weighted average floor and ceiling prices for the period. if exchange rates are within the specified collar range at expiration, the collar expires worthless. if exchange rates are outside of the various collar ranges at expiration, we will settle the difference with the counterparty. (b) fair value was based on market prices. (c) u.s. dollar to foreign currency. (d) foreign currency to u.s. dollar. the aggregate effect on foreign exchange and option contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change to year-end exchange rates would be approximately $15 million. credit risk we are exposed to significant credit risk from united states steel arising from the separation. that exposure is discussed in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel . safe harbor these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and other feedstocks. if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to our hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 57 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "plans," "predicts" or "projects" or variations of these words, suggesting that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements with respect to marathon may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on the business and financial condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. and 2. business and properties general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the "separation"), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ("steel stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, marathon disposed of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ("united states steel") to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, marathon's certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and, from that date, marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. our principal operating subsidiaries are marathon oil company and marathon ashland petroleum llc ("map"). marathon oil company and its predecessors have been engaged in the oil and gas business since 1887. map is 62-percent owned by marathon and 38-percent owned by ashland inc. ("ashland"). segment and geographic information our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) exploration and production ("e&amp;p") explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas; 2) refining, marketing and transportation ("rm&amp;t") refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products; and 3) integrated gas ("ig") markets and transports natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ("lng") and methanol. for operating segment and geographic information, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements on page f-19. exploration and production we are currently conducting exploration, development and production activities in nine countries. principal exploration activities are in the united states, norway, angola, equatorial guinea and canada. principal development and production activities are in the united states, the united kingdom, ireland, norway, equatorial guinea, gabon and russia. we are also pursuing opportunities in north and west africa and the middle east. 2 our 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 170,000 barrels per day ("bpd"), a decrease of 12 percent from 2003 levels. our 2004 worldwide sales of natural gas production, including gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 999 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd"), a decrease of 15 percent compared to 2003. in total, our 2004 worldwide production averaged 337,000 barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") per day, compared to 389,000 boe per day in 2003. (for purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ("mcf ") by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain boe.) in 2005, our worldwide production is expected to average approximately 325,000 to 350,000 boe per day, excluding acquisitions and dispositions. the above projection of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production volumes is a forward-looking statement. some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of production include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, future acquisitions or dispositions of producing properties, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statement. exploration in the united states during 2004, we drilled 35 gross (17 net) exploratory wells of which 22 gross (10 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 22 wells, 3 gross (1 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. internationally, we drilled 21 gross (16 net) exploratory wells of which 13 gross (10 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 13 wells, 13 gross (9 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for us with the potential to add new reserves. at the end of 2004, we had interests in 123 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 94 in the deepwater area. during 2004, we announced that the neptune 7 appraisal well on the neptune unit in the gulf of mexico encountered hydrocarbons. this discovery follows the neptune 3 discovery in 2002 and the neptune 5 discovery in 2003. two successful appraisal sidetrack wells also were drilled from the original neptune 5 location. front end engineering and design for a neptune development is currently underway. we hold a 30 percent interest in the neptune unit. announced in 2003, the perseus discovery is located on viosca knoll block 830 in the gulf of mexico approximately five miles from the existing petronius platform. the perseus discovery was expected to begin production in 2004 via an extended-reach well drilled from the petronius platform. due to hurricane activity in september 2004 and the resulting damage to the petronius platform, production from perseus has been delayed until repairs of the petronius platform can be completed. we hold a 50 percent interest in the perseus discovery. in 2001 a successful discovery well was drilled on the ozona prospect in the gulf of mexico and in 2002 two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was successful. we have established an integrated project team to formulate a development plan. we are currently negotiating commercial terms of a production handling agreement with a nearby operator. we are also in the process of reviewing seismic data to obtain a better understanding of the complex salt formations in the area and to optimize the location of the next well. we hold a 68 percent interest in the ozona prospect. other united states exploration activity during 2004 included three wells in the cook inlet area of alaska, two of which were discoveries, and 11 wells in the anadarko basin in oklahoma, nine of which were discoveries. norway during 2004 we announced the hamsun discovery. the well is located on production license (pl) 150, which is approximately 136 miles from stavanger, norway, and approximately six miles south of the alvheim area. the discovery well and three sidetracks encountered oil and gas. results are being analyzed and development scenarios are being examined including a possible tie-back to the alvheim development. we are the operator of pl150, owning a 65 percent interest. the hamsun well builds on our successful 2003 norwegian drilling program, which resulted in three discoveries, the kneler and boa discoveries in the alvheim development and the vilje (formerly known as klegg) discovery. in december 2004 we acquired four new norwegian exploration licenses, three of which we are designated as operator. angola offshore angola, we own a 10 percent interest in block 31 and a 30 percent interest in block 32. during 2004, we participated in the venus-1 well, the fourth oil discovery on block 31. the venus well is located near the 3 plutao, saturno and marte discoveries in the northeast portion of block 31. these discoveries are the basis for a planned development of the northeast area of block 31. development options are currently being evaluated. during late 2004, we participated in a well on the palas prospect in the southern portion of block 31, and in early 2005, it was announced as a discovery. also, at the end of 2004, operations were ongoing at the ceres prospect, located in the central portion of block 31. during 2004, we announced the canela discovery on block 32, located about 10 miles south of the 2003 gindungo discovery. also in 2004, wells on the cola and gengibre prospects, both on block 32, reached total depth. the cola well encountered hydrocarbons, but additional drilling will be required to determine commerciality. the results of the gengibre well will be announced following government approval. equatorial guinea during 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the alba block offshore equatorial guinea. the deep luba discovery well, drilled from the alba field production platform, encountered gas and condensate in several pay zones. the gardenia discovery well is located approximately 11 miles southwest of the alba field. we are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the deep luba and gardenia discoveries. these discoveries reinforce the potential of the alba block, in which we own a 63 percent interest. in 2003, we announced a natural gas discovery on block d offshore equatorial guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. the discovery well is on the bococo prospect, which is approximately six miles west of the alba field. the well has been suspended for reentry at a later date. development scenarios for the bococo gas discovery along with three earlier dry gas discoveries on block d are being considered for further development. canada in 2002, we announced a gas discovery at the annapolis g-24 deepwater wildcat well approximately 215 miles south of halifax, nova scotia in 5,504 feet of water. the g-24 encountered gas pay over several zones. the crimson well, six miles southeast of the annapolis discovery, was drilled in 2004 and was plugged and abandoned. we are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the annapolis lease. in addition, we operate the adjacent cortland lease where we own a 75 interest and the adjacent empire lease where we own a 50 percent interest. production (including development activities) united states approximately 48 percent of our 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and 63 percent of our worldwide natural gas production was produced from u.s. operations. during 2004, our production in the gulf of mexico averaged 35,700 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 44 percent of our total u.s. liquid hydrocarbon production, and 100 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 16 percent of our total u.s. natural gas production. liquid hydrocarbon production decreased by 17,800 net bpd and natural gas production decreased by 36 net mmcfd from the prior year. the decrease in production is mainly due to natural field declines and the effects of hurricane activity. our petronius platform suffered significant damage from hurricane ivan and was out of service part of september and the entire fourth quarter of 2004. repair activity is underway, but production of liquid hydrocarbons of approximately 19,000 net bpd and natural gas of approximately 32 net mmcfd remains shut in. production is not expected to come back on stream until the second quarter of 2005. at year-end 2004, we held interests in eight producing fields and 11 platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which seven platforms are operated by marathon. our natural gas production from alaska is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and increasing during the fourth and first quarter. in 2004 our alaskan natural gas production averaged 174 net mmcfd, representing 28 percent of our total u.s. gas production. the increase from 2003 production of 166 net mmcfd is primarily due to a full year of production from the ninilchik field. production from the ninilchik field began in 2003 and development continues on the field. ninilchik gas is transported through the 32-mile portion of the kenai kachemak pipeline, which connects ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the kenai peninsula, in anchorage and in other parts of south central alaska. we operate the ninilchik unit and own a 60 percent interest in it and the kenai kachemak pipeline. liquid hydrocarbon production from our wyoming fields averaged 21,200 net bpd in 2004 compared to 21,400 net bpd in 2003. gas production from our wyoming fields averaged 108 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 127 net mmcfd in 2003. the decrease in our wyoming gas production is primarily attributed to lower production from the powder river basin, which averaged 69 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 82 net mmcfd in 2003. this decrease is primarily attributed to natural field decline. development of the powder river basin continued in 2004 with approximately 230 wells drilled, of which 145 are yet to be completed, compared to approximately 320 wells drilled in 2003. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2004 where we participated in the drilling of 18 wells. gas production from our oklahoma fields averaged 82 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 96 net mmcfd in 2003. this 4 decrease is primarily attributed to natural field decline. our 2004 development program continued to focus in the anadarko basin where we participated in the drilling of 53 wells. our share of liquid hydrocarbon production from the permian basin region, which extends from southeast new mexico to west texas averaged 18,900 bpd in 2004, compared to 30,200 bpd in 2003. this decrease is principally due to natural field decline and the sale of the yates field in november 2003. gas production from our new mexico fields, primarily the indian basin field, averaged 85 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 122 net mmcfd in 2003. the decrease in natural gas production is due to natural field decline. gas production from our texas fields, primarily located in east texas, averaged 65 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 73 net mmcfd in 2003. this decrease is mostly due to natural field decline. active development of the mimms creek field in east texas continued in 2004 with the drilling of 26 wells. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and own a 42 percent interest in the south, central, north, and west brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central brae field and west brae/sedgwick fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field are gas-condensate fields. our share of production from the brae area averaged 15,900 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2004, compared with 17,500 bpd in 2003. the decrease primarily resulted from natural field decline. our share of brae gas sales averaged 197 mmcfd in 2004 compared with 198 mmcfd in 2003. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, there are 22 agreements with third-party fields contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae-area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ("sage") system. the beryl group owns the remaining 50 percent. the sage pipeline transports gas from the brae and beryl areas and has a total wet gas capacity of approximately 1,000 mmcfd. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes gas from the sage pipeline and 0.8 billion cubic feet ("bcf") per day of third party gas from the britannia field. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own an approximately 30 percent interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent of east foinaven and 20 percent of the t35 and t25 accumulations, each of which has a single well. our share of production from the foinaven fields averaged 21,900 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10 mmcfd of natural gas in 2004, compared to 22,400 net bpd and 10 mmcfd in 2003. norway we are the operator and own a 65 percent interest in the alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf. this development is comprised of the kneler and boa discoveries and the previously undeveloped kameleon accumulation. during 2004, we received approval from the norwegian authorities for our alvheim plan of development and operation ("pdo"), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ("fpso") with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. the pdo also outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the sage system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. marathon and its alvheim project partners signed a purchase and sale agreement in 2004 for the odin multipurpose shuttle tanker, which will be modified to an fpso. also during 2004, the alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, subject to the approval of the vilje pdo which was submitted to the norwegian government in december 2004. production from a combined alvheim/vilje development is expected to reach more than 50,000 net boe per day with first production starting in 2007. during 2004, production in norway from the heimdal, vale and byggve/skirne fields averaged 2,000 net bpd and 27 net mmcfd. we own a 24 percent interest in the heimdal field, a 47 percent interest in the vale field and a 20 percent interest in the byggve/skirne field, which came on stream during 2004. ireland we own a 100 percent interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale fields in the celtic sea offshore ireland. natural gas sales were 58 mmcfd in 2004, compared with 62 mmcfd in 2003. we have agreed with the seven heads group to process and transport gas, as well as to provide field operating services, through our existing kinsale head facilities. production from seven heads commenced in december 2003. we own an 18.5 percent interest in the corrib gas development project, located approximately 40 miles off ireland's west coast. during 2004, the an bord plean&aacute;la upheld the mayo county council's decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at bellanaboy bridge, county mayo, which will process gas from the 5 corrib field. this decision represents a major step forward for the outside-operated corrib gas project. development work on the corrib project has resumed and first gas production is expected in mid-year 2007. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant held through an equity method investee. during 2004 liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 18,900 bpd and natural gas production averaged 76 mmcfd, compared to 12,400 bpd and 66 mmcfd in 2003. the condensate expansion project was completed during 2004 and began its production ramp up. this expansion project is expected to increase total liquids production from approximately 20,000 gross bpd to approximately 57,000 gross bpd (32,000 bpd net to marathon). by the end of 2004 liquids production had increased to approximately 45,800 gross bpd. the liquefied petroleum gas ("lpg") expansion project progressed during 2004 and is expected to start-up in the second quarter of 2005. when completed, gross liquids production is expected to increase from approximately 57,000 gross bpd to 79,000 gross bpd (44,500 bpd net to marathon). approximately 125 mmcfd of dry gas remaining after the condensate and lpg are removed is supplied to atlantic methanol production company llc ("ampco") where it is used to manufacture methanol. we own 45 percent of ampco, which is reported in the integrated gas segment. remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production when the lng project on bioko island is completed. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent working interest. production in gabon averaged 13,600 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2004, compared with 14,700 net bpd in 2003. production from these three fields is processed on a single facility at tchatamba marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to a non-operated storage facility. during 2004, we extended our license in gabon for 10 years which will now expire in 2018. russia during 2003 we acquired khanty mansiysk oil corporation ("kmoc"). kmoc's fields are located in the khanty mansiysk region of western siberia. production from these assets averaged 16,600 net bpd during 2004, primarily from the potanay and east kamennoye fields. development activities continued in these fields in 2004, with 35 wells drilled in east kamennoye and 17 wells drilled in potanay. additionally, one well was drilled in 2004 on the paitykhskoye license. libya we own a 16.3 percent interest in the approximately 13 million acre waha concession in libya. in 1986, we ceased active participation in the concessions following the imposition of trade sanctions by the u.s. government. in 2004 the u.s. government lifted the sanctions, allowing us to advance plans to return to production operations. we continue to work with our partners, including the libyan government, to finalize the terms of a reentry agreement. gas-to-liquids during 2004, marathon and syntroleum corporation ("syntroleum") successfully completed the construction and operation of a gas-to-liquids ("gtl") demonstration plant at the port of catoosa, oklahoma. this gtl project was part of an ultra-clean fuels production and demonstration project sponsored by the u.s. department of energy's national energy technology laboratory. the catoosa plant, which mirrors a commercial scale plant, successfully demonstrated a fully integrated gtl technology that converted natural gas into a finished fuel, producing more than 5,500 barrels of synthetic products, including ultra-clean diesel fuel, which was delivered to integrated concepts research corporation, a project partner, for fleet vehicle testing in washington, dc and denali national park, alaska. the catoosa gtl plant supports our ongoing efforts to explore the potential of gtl technology, and demonstrates how such technology could be incorporated into the design of a commercial gtl facility such as our proposed gas processing project in qatar. future research of gtl technology as well as other gas technologies is being conducted in our integrated gas segment. in connection with construction of the catoosa gtl plant, we advanced syntroleum $21.3 million under a secured promissory note. the note bears interest at a rate of eight percent per year and matures on june 30, 2006. if syntroleum does not repay the note by june 30, 2006, we will have the right to convert the note into credits against future license fees or into syntroleum common stock at no less than $6.00 per share and no more than $8.50 per share. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing of resumption of production from the petronius platform and the timing and levels of production from the combined alvheim/vilje project, the corrib project, the lpg expansion project and other expansion projects. some factors which could affect the timing of the resumption of production from the petronius platform include unforeseen problems arising from the repair work or further severe weather conditions. some factors which could affect the timing and production levels of the alvheim/vilje project, the corrib project, the lpg expansion project and other expansion projects include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, inability or delays in obtaining necessary government or third party approvals or permits, including norwegian regulatory approval for the vilje pdo, unforeseen problems arising from construction, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the 6 governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. reserves at december 31, 2004, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled approximately 1.139 billion boe, of which 37 percent were located in the united states. the following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years. estimated quantities of

(b) represents marathon's western canadian assets, which were sold in 2003. (c) represents marathon's equity interest in clam, which was sold in 2003. proved developed reserves represented 62 percent of total proved reserves as of december 31, 2004, as compared to 70 percent as of december 31, 2003. of the 430 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2004, only 22 percent have been included as proved reserves for more than two years while 56 percent were added during 2004. 7 during 2004, we added net proved reserves of 221 million boe, excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while producing 122 million boe. these net additions included extensions, discoveries and other additions of 136 million boe and total revisions of 81 million boe. of the total net reserve additions, 25 million boe were proved developed and 194 million boe were proved undeveloped. additionally, we transferred 78 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed during 2004. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, were $708 million, $780 million and $404 million. these amounts include our proportionate share of equity investees' costs incurred as these were costs necessary for the development of proved undeveloped reserves. as of december 31, 2004, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2005 through 2007 are projected to be $718 million, $629 million, and $105 million. the most significant extensions, discoveries and other additions in 2004 are related to the alvheim/vilje developments in norway and the corrib development in ireland. reserve additions for the alvheim/vilje developments totaled 63 million boe, or 46% of total extensions, discoveries and other additions. the pdo for the alvheim development was approved by the norwegian authorities during 2004 and approval of the vilje pdo, which was submitted to the norwegian government in december 2004, is expected in 2005. production from the alvheim/vilje developments is expected to begin in 2007. reserve additions for the corrib development totaled 16 million boe, or 12% of total extensions, discoveries and other additions. with the planning permission received from the irish authorities for the proposed natural gas terminal, which is to be built to bring gas from the corrib field ashore, development activities are underway. first gas production is expected in 2007. the alba field in equatorial guinea had the most significant positive revisions 162 million boe. of this volume, 84 million boe was added due to the final investment decision on the equatorial guinea lng project, which will use the gas from the alba field to produce lng. startup of the lng plant is expected in 2007. an additional 66 million boe is related to additional compression that is expected to be installed in 2010 and will be necessary for the lng plant to meet its requirements. at the end of 2004, our total proved reserves associated with the alba field offshore equatorial guinea totaled 471 million boe, or 41 percent of our total proved reserves. we had negative revisions of 51 million boe in russia and 40 million boe in the powder river basin due to disappointing results from development activity. these revisions, combined with extensions, discoveries and other additions and a small disposition, resulted in total net reductions in reserves of 46 million boe for russia and 35 million boe for the powder river basin. the above estimated quantities of reserves, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, timing of production from development projects and timing of the lng plant activities are forward-looking statements, are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. with respect to additional factors that may affect the alvheim/vilje developments, the corrib development and the lng plant, please refer to page 6. for additional details of estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see "consolidated financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves" on pages f-45 through f-46. we filed reports with the u.s. department of energy ("doe") for the years 2003 and 2002 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and gas reserves. we will file a similar report for 2004. the year-end estimates reported to the doe are the same as the estimates reported in the supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements. in alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with the local utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 181 bcf of natural gas over the remaining life of these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2016. in addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska lng plant and a proportionate share of the long-term lng sales obligation to two japanese utility companies. this obligation is estimated to total 110 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates march 31, 2009. these commitments are structured with variable-pricing terms. our production from various gas fields in the cook inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. our proved reserves and estimated production rates in the cook inlet sufficiently meet these contractual obligations. 8 in the u.k., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 210 bcf of natural gas through the remaining life of these contracts, which terminate in september 2009. our brae area production, together with natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, will supply the natural gas to service these contracts. our brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates sufficiently meet these contractual obligations. pricing under these gas sales contracts is variable. oil and natural gas production the following tables set

12,036 6,534 11 refining, marketing and transportation our rm&amp;t operations are primarily conducted by map and its subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, speedway superamerica llc ("ssa") and marathon ashland pipe line llc. refining map owns and operates seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 948,000 barrels of crude oil per day. the table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of map's refineries as of december 31, 2004: crude oil refining capacity (barrels per day) garyville, la 245,000 catlettsburg, ky 222,000 robinson, il 192,000 detroit, mi 74,000 canton, oh 73,000 texas city, tx 72,000 st. paul park, mn 70,000 total 948,000 map's refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated gasoline. map's refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect the refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available; gas oil may be moved from robinson to detroit where excess fluid catalytic cracking unit capacity is available; and light cycle oil may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess desulfurization capacity is available. map also produces asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. map manufactures petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, map manufactures aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene and slack wax. during 2004, map's refineries processed 939,000 bpd of crude oil and 171,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. the following table sets forth map's refinery production by product group for each of the last three years: refined product yields (thousands of barrels per day) 2004 2003 2002 gasoline 608 567 581 distillates 299 284 285 propane 22 21 21 feedstocks and special products 94 93 80 heavy fuel oil 25 24 20 asphalt 77 72 72 total 1,125 1,061 1,059 planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. map completed major turnarounds at its garyville, catlettsburg and canton refineries during 2004. map increased its overall crude oil refining capacity during 2004 from 935,000 bpd to 948,000 bpd after completing the planned turnaround and expansion project at the garyville refinery. this expansion increased crude oil capacity at garyville from 232,000 bpd to 245,000 bpd. 12 the catlettsburg refinery multi-year improvement project was completed during early 2004. at a cost of approximately $440 million, the project improves product yields and lowers overall refinery costs while making gasoline with less than 30 parts per million of sulfur, which allows map to meet tier ii gasoline regulations which became effective on january 1, 2004. map is constructing approximately $300 million in new capital projects for its 74,000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. one of the projects, a $110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100,000 bpd. other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. marketing in 2004 map's refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 20.4 billion gallons (1,329,000 bpd). the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map's refined product sales volumes in 2004, excluding sales related to matching buy/sell transactions. approximately 52 percent of map's gasoline sales volumes and 92 percent of its distillate sales volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2004. approximately 55 percent of map's propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 16 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india and south america. map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast. the map customer base includes approximately 800 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. the following table sets forth the volume of map's consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 2004 2003 2002 gasoline 807 776 773 distillates 373 365 346 propane 22 21 22 feedstocks and special

territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin. map also sells low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. as of december 31, 2004, map supplied petroleum products to about 3,900 marathon and ashland branded retail outlets located primarily in michigan, ohio, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in florida, georgia, wisconsin, west virginia, tennessee, minnesota, virginia, pennsylvania, north carolina, alabama, and south carolina. ssa sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated retail outlets. as of december 31, 2004, ssa had 1,669 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names "speedway" and "superamerica." ssa's revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.3 billion in 2004, compared with $2.2 billion in 2003. profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. pilot travel centers llc ("ptc"), a joint venture with pilot corporation ("pilot"), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with approximately 250 locations in 35 states at december 31, 2004. the travel centers 13 offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand name restaurants. pilot and map each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. map's retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa's midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand, and continued growth for ptc. supply and transportation map obtains the crude oil it processes from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. in 2004, map's net purchases of u.s. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged 416,000 bpd, including a net 20,000 bpd from marathon. in 2004, canada was the source for 14 percent or 130,000 bpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 42 percent or 393,000 bpd of the crude oil processed by map's refineries, including approximately 245,000 bpd from the middle east. this crude was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and traders. map operates a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to its refineries and refined products to its marketing areas. at december 31, 2004, map owned, leased, or had an ownership interest in approximately 2,860 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,850 miles of product trunk lines. at december 31, 2004 map had interests in the following pipelines: 100 percent ownership of ohio river pipe line llc, which owns the cardinal products pipeline, a refined products pipeline extending from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio; 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a system connecting gulf coast refineries with the midwest market; 47 percent interest in loop llc ("loop"), which is the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana; 50 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois; and 33 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of map's st. paul park, minnesota refinery. map's 84 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeast. these facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. map's marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. map also leases and owns rail cars in various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors, tank trailers and general service trucks. marathon also has interests in two refined product pipelines which are not part of map: 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, which is a light-product pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a light-product pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois to toledo, ohio. the above discussion of the rm&amp;t segment includes forward-looking statements concerning anticipated completion of the detroit refinery capital projects. some factors that could affect the detroit projects include unforeseen problems arising from construction, regulatory approval constraints, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 14 integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefication and regasification operations, methanol operations, certain other gas processing facilities and pipeline operations, and marketing and transportation of natural gas. also included are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects. methanol we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the alba field. methanol sales totaled 980,000 gross metric tons (441,000 net metric tons) in 2004. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. natural gas marketing and transportation activities in addition to the sale of our own natural gas production, we purchase gas from third-party producers and marketers for resale. we own a 24 percent interest in nautilus pipeline company, llc and a 24 percent interest in manta ray offshore gathering company, llc, which are both gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems. additionally, we own a 34 percent interest in the neptune natural gas processing plant located in st. mary parish, louisiana. the plant has the capacity to process 600 mmcfd of natural gas, which is supplied by the nautilus pipeline system. alaska lng we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefication plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, the lng has been sold under a long-term contract with two of japan's largest utility companies. lng deliveries totaled 62 gross bcf (24 net bcf) in 2004. equatorial guinea lng project during 2004, marathon and its partner, compania nacional de petroleos de guinea ecuatorial ("gepetrol"), the national oil company of equatorial guinea, through equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ("egholdings"), began construction of an lng plant on bioko island that will deliver a contracted offtake of 3.4 million metric tons per year (approximately 460 mmcfd). this project will allow us to monetize our gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the plant will be purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term gas supply agreement. construction of the plant continues to progress and startup is projected for late 2007. at the end of 2004, we held a 75 percent economic interest in egholdings, with gepetrol holding the remaining 25 percent economic interest. in connection with the formation of egholdings, gepetrol was given certain contractual rights with respect to the purchase and resale to a third party of a 13 percent interest in egholdings currently held by marathon. these rights give gepetrol the option to purchase this 13 percent interest and resell it to a third party. these rights specify that we will be reimbursed for our historical costs plus an additional specified rate of return, which escalates depending on the time period during which such purchase and resale occurs, and a right to share in additional proceeds above those amounts under certain circumstances of resale. if gepetrol's rights are not exercised within one year from date of project sanction, which was in june 2004, the rights expire. egholdings has signed a sales and purchase agreement with a subsidiary of bg group plc ("bgml") under which bgml would purchase the lng plant's production for a period of 17 years on an fob bioko island basis with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. the lng would be targeted primarily to a receiving terminal in lake charles, louisiana, where it would be regasified and delivered into the gulf coast natural gas pipeline grid. elba island lng during 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes as part of our elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal capacity rights agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we can supply up to 58 billion cubic feet of natural gas (as lng) per year, for up to 22 years. also during 2004, we signed an agreement with bp energy company ("bp") under which bp will supply us with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years beginning in the second half of 2005. we will 15 take delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement with bp enables us to fully utilize our capacity rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded gas resources beyond the term of the bp contract. we continue to actively seek additional cargoes prior to the start of deliveries from bp. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the estimated construction and startup dates of a lng liquefaction plant and related facilities. factors that could affect the estimated construction and startup dates of the lng plant and related facilities include, without limitation, unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and gas. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, we believe we currently rank eighth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2003 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. marathon through map must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. map believes it ranks fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2004. map competes in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products and believes it competes with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; 8 refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 220 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa's retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway . we also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in ptc. our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001 ("reorganization agreement"), marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. thomas j. usher is the non-executive chairman of the board of both companies, and, as of december 31, 2004, four of the ten remaining members of marathon's board of directors are also directors of united states steel. 16 in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all marathon's principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by marathon: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel's fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for marathon's discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. $2 million of the industrial revenue bonds are scheduled to mature in the period extending through december 31, 2009. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. united states steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed lease obligations. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee marathon provided with respect to all united states steel's obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel's obligations to marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel's accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. tax sharing agreement marathon and united states steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. provisions of this agreement include the following: for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before december 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between marathon and united states steel generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation; 17 no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after december 31, 2001; and provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free transaction and limitations on post-separation activities that might jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation. under the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation: the taxes payable by each of the marathon group and the u.s. steel group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return; and the u.s. steel group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable. in accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the separation, marathon made a preliminary settlement with united states steel of approximately $440 million as the net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended december 31, 2001 under the pre-separation tax sharing principles. the tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended before december 31, 2001. in the tax sharing agreement, each of marathon and united states steel promised the other party that it: would not, before january 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation; and would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from the separation ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction. the prescribed actions and transactions include: the liquidation of marathon or united states steel; and the sale by marathon or united states steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business. in case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability. even if the separation otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code, the separation may become taxable to marathon under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either marathon or united states steel is acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the separation. for this purpose, a "50 percent or greater interest" means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. to minimize this risk, both marathon and united states steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their equity structures that could cause the separation to be treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the internal revenue code may apply. if an acquisition occurs that results in the separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that acquisition transaction. although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the separation, each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the separation, is jointly and severally liable under the internal revenue code for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. marathon can provide no assurance, however, that united states steel will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement. 18 obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2004 see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel" on page 42 for a discussion of marathon's obligations associated with the separation. environmental matters we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors. our health, environment and safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. the health, environment and safety management committee, which is comprised of our officers, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. we also have an emergency management team, composed of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving marathon or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ("caa") with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ("cwa") with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ("opa-90") with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. these laws and their associated regulations are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on marathon for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for marathon's acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies" on page 44 and "legal proceedings" on page 21. air of particular significance to map are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. map's combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. costs incurred through december 31, 2004 were approximately $520 million. some factors that could potentially affect map's gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include completion of project detailed engineering, construction and startup activities. the u.s. epa has finalized new and revised national ambient air quality standards ("naaqs") for fine particulate emissions (pm2.5) and ozone. in connection with these new standards, epa will designate certain areas as "nonattainment," meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas epa has proposed a rule called the interstate air quality rule ("iaqr") that will require significant reductions of so 2 and nox emissions in numerous states. all of our refinery operations are located in these affected states. if this rule is finalized, it could have a significant impact on our operations as well as the operations of many of our competitors. at this time, we cannot determine whether the iaqr will be finalized or whether it will be substantially changed before it is final. as a result, we cannot presently reasonably estimate the financial impact of such a rule. water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous 19 substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. as of december 31, 2004, all of the barges used in map's river transportation operations meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ("usts") containing regulated substances. since the epa has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of rcra and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the implementing regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance with this statute cannot be accurately estimated. in addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement fund once the applicable deductible has been satisfied. accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. as a general rule, marathon and ashland retained responsibility for certain remediation costs arising out of the prior ownership and operation of businesses transferred to map. such continuing responsibility, in certain situations, may be subject to threshold or sunset agreements, which gradually diminish this responsibility over time. properties the location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of marathon have been described previously. except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency. at the date of acquisition of important properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. the properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim. the basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in "consolidated financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves" on pages f-45 through f-46. property, plant and equipment additions for property, plant and equipment additions, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity capital expenditures" on page 39. 20 employees we had 25,804 active employees as of december 31, 2004, including 22,661 map employees. of the total number of map employees, 16,413 were employees of speedway superamerica llc, most of which were employed at retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at the catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the paper, allied-industrial, chemical and energy workers international union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2006. the same union represents certain hourly employees at the texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2006. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2006 at the st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2007 at the detroit refinery. available information general information about marathon, including the corporate governance principles and charters for the audit committee, compensation committee, corporate governance and nominating committee, and committee on financial policy, can be found at www.marathon.com. in addition, our code of business conduct and code of ethics for senior financial officers are available on the website at www.marathon.com/values/corporate_governance/. marathon's annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k, as well as any amendments and exhibits to those reports, are available free of charge through the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed or furnished with the sec. these documents are also available in hard copy, free of charge, by contacting our investor relations office. information contained on our website is not incorporated into this form 10-k or other securities filings. item 3. legal proceedings marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. certain of these matters are included below in this discussion. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. however, management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably. natural gas royalty litigation marathon was served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and indian lessees violated the false claims act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. the first case, u.s. ex rel jack j. grynberg v. alaska pipeline co., et al. is primarily a gas measurement case, and the second case, u.s. ex rel harrold e. wright v. agip petroleum co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. these cases assert that false claims have been filed by lessees and that penalties, damages and interest total more than $25 billion. the department of justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including marathon. the matters are in the discovery phase and marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases. powder river basin litigation the u.s. bureau of land management ("blm") completed a multi-year review of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin in montana and wyoming. the agency's record of decision ("rod") was signed on april 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane development. plaintiff environmental and other groups filed four suits in may 2003 in the u.s. district court for the district of montana against the blm alleging the agency's environmental impact review was not adequate. plaintiffs seek a court order enjoining coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin until blm conducts additional studies on the environmental impact. marathon has been allowed to intervene as a party in all four of the cases. as the lawsuits to delay energy development in the powder river basin progress through the courts, blm continues to process permits to drill under the rod. in january 2004, the court over protests of plaintiffs, transferred to the district court of wyoming, portions of two of the cases dealing with the sufficiency of the environmental impact review as to lands in wyoming. in may 2004, plaintiff environmental groups environmental defense et al, filed suit against the u.s. bureau of land management ("blm") in montana federal district court, alleging the agency did not adequately consider air 21 quality impacts of coal bed methane and oil and gas operations in the powder river basin in montana and wyoming when preparing its environmental impact statements. plaintiffs request that blm be ordered to cease issuing leases and permits for energy development, until additional analysis of predicted air impacts is conducted. marathon and pennaco energy, inc. have intervened in the litigation. environmental proceedings the following is a summary of proceedings involving marathon that were pending or contemplated as of december 31, 2004, under federal and state environmental laws. except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management's belief set forth in the first paragraph under item 3. "legal proceedings" above takes such matters into account. claims under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("cercla") and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. potentially responsible parties ("prps") for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. liability is strict and can be joint and several. because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with cercla. projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. at december 31, 2004, marathon had been identified as a prp at a total of six cercla waste sites. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with all but one of these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000. marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under $4 million. in addition, there is one site where marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. there are also 131 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. of these sites, 14 were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland which has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 25 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 53 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site, 19 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site and 8 sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site. there are 11 sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs. there is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the michigan department of environmental quality ("mdeq") at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near muskegon, michigan. during the next five years, marathon anticipates spending less than $7 million at this site. expenditures in 2004 were approximately $391,000, and expenditures in 2005 are expected to be $600,000 as technical evaluation continues, and could be as much as $3,900,000 if soil remediation is commenced in the second half of the year. ongoing work at this site is subject to approval by the mdeq, and a risk-based closure strategy is being developed for approval by the mdeq. map has had a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general's office since 2002 concerning map's self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its robinson, illinois refinery. map has had periodic discussions with illinois officials regarding this matter and more discussions may occur in 2005. 22 in july, 2002, marathon received a notice of enforcement from the state of texas for alleged excess air emissions from its yates gas plant and production operations on its kloh lease. a settlement of this matter was finalized in 2004, with marathon and its co-owners paying a civil penalty of $74,000 and the donation of land as a supplemental environmental project in lieu of a further penalty of $74,000. marathon is owner of a 38% interest in the facilities. in may, 2003, marathon received a consolidated compliance order &amp; notice or potential penalty from the state of louisiana for alleged various air permit regulatory violations. this matter was settled for a civil penalty of $148,628 and awaits formal closure with the state. in august of 2004, the west virginia department of environmental protection ("wvdep") submitted a draft consent order to map regarding map's handling of alleged hazardous waste generated from tank cleanings in the state of west virginia. the proposed order seeks a civil penalty of $337,900. map has met with the wvdep and discussions are ongoing in an attempt to resolve this matter. item 4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders not applicable. part ii item 5. market for registrant's common equity and related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities the principal market on which the company's common stock is traded is the new york stock exchange. the company's common stock is also traded on the chicago stock exchange and the pacific exchange. information concerning the high and low sales prices for the common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in "selected quarterly financial data (unaudited)" on page f-41. as of january 31, 2005, there were 58,340 registered holders of marathon common stock. the board of directors intends to declare and pay dividends on marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of marathon oil corporation, although it has no obligation under delaware law or the restated certificate of incorporation to do so. in determining its dividend policy with respect to marathon common stock, the board will rely on the financial statements of marathon. dividends on marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of marathon. the following table provides information about purchases by marathon and its affiliated purchaser during the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2004 of equity securities that are registered by marathon pursuant to section 12 of the exchange act: issuer purchases of equity securities (a) (b) (c) (d) period total number of shares purchased (1)(2) average price paid per share total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs (1) maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs 10/01/04 10/31/04 6,015 $40.51 n/a n/a 11/01/04 11/30/04 5,145 $38.94 n/a n/a 12/01/04 12/31/04 34,526 $37.07 n/a n/a total: 45,686 $37.73 n/a n/a (1) 42,749 shares were repurchased in open-market transactions under the marathon oil corporation dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the "plan") by the administrator of the plan. stock needed to meet the requirements of the plan are either purchased in the open market or issued directly by marathon. (2) 2,936 shares of restricted stock were delivered by employees to marathon, upon vesting, to satisfy tax withholding requirements. item 6. selected financial data see page f-49 through f-51. 23 item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marathon oil corporation is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through our 62 percent owned subsidiary, marathon ashland petroleum llc ("map"); and integrated gas. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with items 1. and 2. business and properties, item 6. selected financial data and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" on page 50. e&amp;p segment income during 2004 was impacted by lower production (on an equivalent barrel basis) down approximately 13 percent from 2003 levels. we estimate that our 2005 production will average approximately 325,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("boepd"), excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions or potential reentry into libya. our continued exploration success coupled with ongoing development of our base businesses and new core areas, provides defined production growth that is expected to increase our average daily production by an estimated compounded average growth rate of five to nine percent between 2005 and 2008. projected production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, supply and demand, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production decline 24 rates for mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability and geological and operating considerations. these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been driven by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in economic activity and political developments in the world's major oil and gas producing areas, including opec member countries. any substantial decline in such prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. a decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development. e&amp;p operations are subject to various hazards, including acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas. offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the gulf of mexico, the north sea, the u.k. atlantic margin, the celtic sea, offshore nova scotia and offshore west africa are also subject to severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. development of new production properties in countries outside the united states may require protracted negotiations with host governments and are frequently subject to political considerations, such as tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects. refining, marketing and transportation map refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states. refining, marketing and transportation ("rm&amp;t") segment income primarily represents map's income from operations which depends largely on the refining and wholesale marketing margin, refinery throughputs, retail marketing margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the profitability of its pipeline transportation operations. the refining and wholesale marketing margin is the difference between the wholesale prices of refined products sold and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks refined, the cost of purchased products and manufacturing costs. map purchases crude oil to satisfy the throughput requirements of its refineries. as a result, its refining and wholesale marketing margin could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. the crack spread, which is a measure of the difference between spot market gasoline and distillate prices and spot market crude costs, is an industry indicator of refining margins. in addition to changes in the crack spread, map's refining and wholesale marketing margin is impacted by the types of crude oil processed, the wholesale selling prices realized for all the products sold and the level of manufacturing costs. map processes significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances its competitive position in the industry as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. as crude oil production increases in the coming years, heavy sour crude oil production growth is expected to outpace sweet crude oil production growth, which may translate into higher sour crude oil discounts going forward. over the last three years, approximately 60 percent of the crude oil throughput at map's refineries has been sour crude oil. sales of asphalt increase during the highway construction season in map's market area which is primarily in the second and third calendar quarters. the selling price of asphalt is dependent on the cost of crude oil, the price of alternative paving materials and the level of construction activity in both the private and public sectors. changes in manufacturing costs from period to period are primarily dependent on the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas. the refining and wholesale marketing margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the expectations regarding the adequacy of the supply of refined products and raw materials. for information on price risk management, see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" on page 50. additionally, the retail marketing gasoline and distillate margin, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the wholesale cost of the refined products, including secondary transportation, plays an important part in downstream profitability. the retail gasoline and distillate margin has been historically volatile, but tends to be countercyclical to the refining and wholesale marketing margin. factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross margin from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in the marketing areas. the profitability of map's pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through the pipelines. the volume of crude oil that map transports is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by map's crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of alternative transportation modes, and the refinery and 25 transportation system maintenance levels. the throughput of the refined products that map transports is directly affected by the production level of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by map's refined product pipelines. in most of map's markets, demand for gasoline peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september, and declines during the fall and winter months. the seasonal pattern for distillates is the reverse of this, helping to level overall movements on an annual basis. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and maintenance levels influence refined product movements. environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, have imposed (and are expected to continue to impose) increasingly stringent and costly requirements on refining and marketing operations that may have an adverse effect on margins and financial condition. refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. integrated gas our integrated gas ("ig") operations include marketing and transporting natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ("lng") and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. also included are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects, such as the lng project in equatorial guinea. the profitability of these operations depends largely on commodity prices, volume deliveries, margins on resale gas, and demand. methanol spot pricing is volatile largely because global methanol demand is only 33 million tons and any major unplanned shutdown or addition in production capacity can have a significant impact on the supply-demand balance. ig operations could be impacted by unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, product spills, inclement weather or availability of lng vessels. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. 2004 operating highlights we realized continued exploration success with six discoveries including the deep luba and gardenia wells in equatorial guinea, the venus and canela wells in angola, the hamsun well in norway and the neptune 7 well in the gulf of mexico. we strengthened core areas by: receiving approval of the plan of development and operation ("pdo") for the alvheim project in norway and reaching agreement to develop vilje through the alvheim infrastructure; completing the equatorial guinea condensate expansion project and advancing the liquefied petroleum gas ("lpg") expansion project; and receiving planning permission from the irish authorities for the corrib development. we added net proved reserves of 221 million barrels of oil equivalent ("boe"), excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while producing 122 million boe of production during 2004. over the past three years, we have added net proved reserves of 782 million boe, excluding dispositions of 280 million, while producing 411 million boe. three-year amounts include 7 million boe of net proved reserve additions, 19 million boe of dispositions and 7 million boe of production related to equity investees. we strengthened map assets by: completing the catlettsburg, kentucky refinery repositioning project, which has improved product yields, lowered overall refinery costs and allowed map to meet the tier ii gasoline regulations; increasing crude oil capacity at our garyville, louisiana refinery from 232,000 barrels per day ("bpd") to 245,000 bpd, which allowed us to achieve record crude oil and other feedstock refinery throughputs of 1,110,000 bpd; progressing an expansion project to increase the capacity of the detroit, michigan refinery; and increasing same store merchandise sales by 11 percent at speedway superamerica llc ("ssa"). we advanced our integrated gas strategy by: reaching final investment decision and beginning construction on a 3.4 million metric tonnes per year lng plant in equatorial guinea; 26 signing an agreement with bp energy company under which bp will supply us with 58 billion cubic feet ("bcf") of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of 5 years, beginning in the second half of 2005; securing six cargos of lng utilizing our elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal delivery rights; and completing the construction and operation of a gas-to-liquids ("gtl") demonstration plant at the port of catoosa, oklahoma. we signed an agreement to acquire ashland's 38 percent interest in map and continue to pursue completion of the transaction. we continued our business transformation programs, including implementation of two outsourcing agreements, to achieve further business process improvements and cost reductions. we increased the quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share. management's discussion and analysis of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties and the expected future taxable income available to realize the value of deferred tax assets also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively and negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, economic and political conditions change. during 2004, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 81 million boe as a result of 190 million boe in positive revisions which were partially offset by 109 million boe in negative revisions. our estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by internal teams of in-house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates prepared by these internal teams are approved by members of the corporate reserve group upon input into marathon's reserve system. any change to proved reserves in excess of 2.5 million boe, on a field-total basis for a single month, must be approved by the director of corporate reserves. in 2003, we implemented a process to have third party consultants audit the top 80 percent of our reserves over a 3 year period. those third party audits have been completed on roughly 50 percent of our year-end 2004 reserves and have not resulted in any reserve changes. in addition to third party audits, the corporate reserve group routinely audits properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long reserves life, sudden changes in performance, changes in economic or operating conditions, or recent acquisitions of material fields. the reserves of the alba field offshore equatorial guinea comprise approximately 40 percent of our total proved oil and gas reserves. the next five largest oil and gas producing asset groups the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom, the alvheim/vilje development offshore norway, the kenai field in alaska, the petronius 27 development in the gulf of mexico and the foinaven area complex offshore the united kingdom comprise a total of approximately 20 percent of our total proved oil and gas reserves. impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which is generally on a field-by-field basis for e&amp;p assets, at the refinery and associated distribution system level or at the pipeline system level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. if the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas producing asset groups require assumptions about matters such as future oil and gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of oil and gas, expected field performance and the political environment in the host country. an impairment of any of our large oil and gas producing property asset groups could have a material impact on the presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. marathon evaluates its unproved property investment for impairment based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an undiscounted future net cash flow approach. information such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage are also considered. the expected future cash flows from our downstream assets require assumptions about matters such as future product prices, future crude oil and other feedstock costs, estimated remaining lives of the assets and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets' existing service potential. during the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment of $32 million related to unproved properties and $12 million related to producing properties primarily due to unsuccessful developmental drilling activity in russia. during the years ended december 31, 2003 and 2002, we did not have significant impairment charges. suspended exploratory well costs we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves, geological and geophysical costs, and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed. costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following the completion of drilling and these criteria are not met. it is not unusual for costs associated with complex deepwater or international discoveries to be suspended on our balance sheet for more than a year while we are performing additional appraisal work, determining an optimal plan of development or awaiting project sanction by our board of directors, our co-venturers and the government entity having jurisdiction over the area under development. however, we continually monitor the progress being made towards the ultimate development of projects to ensure that continued capitalization is appropriate. at december 31, 2004, total costs capitalized attributable to suspended exploratory well costs were $339 million. of the $339 million, $309 million relates to wells in areas where additional exploratory wells are underway or firmly planned. $23 million relates to wells in areas where additional wells are not firmly planned; however, less than a year has elapsed since the rig release for these wells. the remaining $7 million relates to single well projects that were drilling over year end and completion costs. exploration expense was $202 million, $180 million and $192 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002. costs incurred for exploration as reported on page f-42 was $291 million, $231 million and $258 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002. exploration expense differs from exploration costs incurred due to timing differences between when costs are incurred and when those costs are ultimately recognized as expense. for example, costs may be incurred and suspended as exploratory well costs in one year and recorded in exploration expense in a subsequent year if it is ultimately determined that proved reserves cannot be recognized. additionally, exploration costs incurred for wells that find proved reserves are transferred to proved property and remain capitalized, and therefore will not be recorded as exploration expense. instead these costs will be expensed in depreciation, depletion and amortization on a units-of-production basis once production begins. exploration expense also includes non-cash charges for unproved property impairments. for 2004, 2003 and 2002 exploration expense included $52 million, $31 million and $25 million 28 of unproved property impairment charges. dry well expense included in exploration expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $54 million, $55 million and $91 million. the remaining costs included in exploration expense of $96 million, $94 million and $76 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002 represent geological and geophysical costs, administrative expenses and other expenses. in february 2005, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") proposed fasb staff position fas 19-a, "accounting for suspended well costs" ("fsp fas 19-a"), which would amend the guidance for suspended well costs in statement of financial accounting standard no. 19, "financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies" ("sfas no. 19"). sfas no. 19 requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. if classification of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of the drilling in an area requiring a major capital expenditure, paragraph 31(a) of sfas no. 19 provides that the cost should continue to be carried as an asset provided that (1) there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and (2) drilling of the additional exploratory well is underway or firmly planned for the near future. if either of those two criteria is not met, sfas no. 19 indicates the entity should expense the exploratory well costs. for all other exploratory wells not addressed in paragraph 31(a), paragraph 31(b) provides that the capitalized costs should be charged to expense if the reserves cannot be classified as proved after a year following the completion of exploratory drilling. questions have arisen in practice about the application of this guidance due to changes in oil and gas exploration processes and lifecycles. the issue is whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future. the proposed fsp fas 19-a would allow exploratory well costs to continue to be capitalized when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (b) the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. our current policy as described above is in accordance with the proposed fsp fas 19-a. depreciation, depletion and amortization of property, plant and equipment depreciation and depletion of producing oil and gas properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved developed recoverable reserves. the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been immaterial. a five percent increase in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $5.55 per barrel to $5.29 per barrel, which would increase pre-tax income by $32 million annually. a five percent decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $5.55 per barrel to $5.84 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre-tax income of $35 million annually. property, plant and equipment in our rm&amp;t segment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 42 years. useful lives are based on historical experience and the assumption that we will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to maintain the assets in good operating condition. factors which could affect the estimated useful lives of our rm&amp;t property, plant and equipment include changes in planned use, environmental regulations, competition and technological advances. there have been no significant changes in the useful lives of our rm&amp;t property, plant and equipment during the 2002-2004 period. expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. as of december 31, 2004, we reported net deferred tax assets of $1.360 billion, which represented gross assets of $1.853 billion net of valuation allowances of $493 million. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, we consider proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. 29 additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. net realizable value of receivables from united states steel as described further in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel" on page 42, we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. as of december 31, 2004, we have reported receivables from united states steel of $602 million, representing the amount of principal and accrued interest on marathon debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment. we must assess the realizability of these receivables, based on our expectations of united states steel's ability to satisfy its obligations. to make this assessment, we must rely on public information about united states steel. as of december 31, 2004, we have judged the entire receivable to be realizable. we may continue to be exposed to the risk of nonpayment by united states steel on a significant portion of this receivable until december 31, 2011. of the $602 million, $472 million, or 78 percent, relates to industrial revenue bonds that are due in 2011 or later. the financial matters agreement between marathon and united states steel provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, which is december 31, 2011, united states steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. as of december 31, 2004, our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (which includes debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment and suspended cash distributions to ashland) was 8 percent. the assessment of our liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by expectations concerning united states steel's ability to satisfy its obligations. if the debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment were excluded from the computation, our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of december 31, 2004 would have been approximately 1 percent. on the other hand, if the receivable from united states steel had been written off as unrealizable, the cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of december 31, 2004 would have been approximately 8 percent. (if united states steel were unable to satisfy its obligations, other adjustments in addition to the write-off of the receivable may be necessary.) contingent liabilities we accrue contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. actual costs can differ from estimates for multiple reasons. for instance, the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. under the accounting rules, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. we generally record these losses as "costs of revenues" or "selling, general and administrative expenses" on the consolidated statement of income, except for tax contingencies, which are recorded as "other taxes" or "provision for income taxes." for additional information on contingent liabilities, see "management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies" on page 44. an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. 30 pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves assumptions related to: discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected long-term rates of return on plan assets rate of future increases in compensation levels health care cost projections we develop our demographics and utilize the work of outside actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. in determining the discount rate, we review market yields on high-quality corporate debt and perform an in-depth analysis of projected pension plan cash flows relating to the duration of pension plan liabilities. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness. compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page f-30, includes detailed information for the three years ended december 31, 2004, on the components of pension and other postretirement expense and the underlying assumptions as well as the funded status for the company's pension plans for the years ended 2004 and 2003. of the assumptions used to measure the december 31, 2004 obligations and estimated 2005 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit costs reported for the plans. a .25 percent decrease in the discount rate of 5.75 percent for domestic and 5.30 percent for international would increase pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately $13 million and $2 million, respectively. estimated fair value of derivative contracts we record all derivative instruments at fair value. derivative instruments are used to manage risk throughout our different businesses. these risks relate to commodities, interest rates and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. we use derivative instruments that are exchange traded and non-exchange traded. non-exchange traded instruments are referred to as over-the-counter ("otc") instruments. for commodities, the fair value of exchange traded instruments is based on existing market quotes. fair value for otc instruments such as options and swap agreements is developed through the use of option-pricing models or third party market quotes. forward contracts are valued based on quotes from the counterparties of the forward contracts. we also have two long-term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the united kingdom ("u.k."). these contracts expire in september 2009. these contracts were entered into in the early 1990s in support of our investments in the east brae field and the sage pipeline. contract prices are linked to a basket of energy and other indices. the contract price is reset annually in october based on the previous twelve-month changes in the basket of indices. consequently, the prices under these contracts do not track forward gas prices. these u.k. gas contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments. the fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward gas strip price to the expected sales volumes for the next eighteen months under these contracts. adjustments to the fair value of these contracts result in noncash charges or credits to income from operations. the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward gas strip price may fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect income from operations. the noncash change in fair value recognized in earnings was a loss of $99 million in 2004, a loss of $66 million in 2003 and a gain of $18 million in 2002. these effects are primarily due to the u.k. 18-month forward gas price curve strengthening 36 and 26 percent during 2004 and 2003 and weakening 12 percent during 2002. 31 for additional information on market risk sensitivity, see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" on page 50. matching buy/sell transactions matching buy/sell transactions are arrangements in which we agree to buy a specific quantity and quality of crude oil or refined petroleum products to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or refined petroleum products at a different location, usually with the same counterparty. all matching buy/sell transactions are settled in cash and are recorded in both revenues and costs of revenues as separate sales and purchase transactions, or on a "gross" basis. in a typical buy/sell transaction, we enter into a contract to sell a particular grade of crude oil or refined product at a specified location and date to a particular counterparty, and simultaneously agree to buy a particular grade of crude oil or refined product at a different location on the same or another specified date, typically from the same counterparty. the value of the purchased volumes rarely equals the sales value of the sold volumes. the value difference between purchases and sales are primarily due to 1) grade/quality differentials, 2) location differentials or 3) timing differences, in those instances when the purchase and sale do not occur in the same month. for the e&amp;p segment, we enter into matching buy/sell transactions to reposition crude oil from one market center to another in order to maximize the value received for our crude oil production. for the rm&amp;t segment, we enter into crude oil matching buy/sell transactions to secure the most profitable refinery supply and refined product matching buy/sell transactions to meet projected customer demands and to secure the required volumes in the most cost-effective manner. the characteristics of our matching buy/sell transactions include gross invoicing between marathon and its counterparties and cash settlement of the transactions. nonperformance by one party to deliver generally does not relieve the other party's obligation to perform. both transactions require physical delivery of the product. the risks and rewards of ownership are evidenced by title transfer, assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling, credit risk, counterparty nonperformance risk and the fact that we have the primary obligation to perform. we believe matching buy/sell transactions are monetary in nature and thus outside the scope of apb opinion no. 29, "accounting for nonmonetary transactions" ("apb no. 29"). additionally, we have evaluated eitf no. 99-19, "reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent" ("eitf no. 99-19") and, based on that evaluation, management believes that the recording these transactions on a gross basis is appropriate. the emerging issues task force ("eitf") is currently considering issue no. 04-13, "accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty," ("eitf no. 04-13"), which relates to transactions in which an entity sells inventory to another entity in the same line of business from which it also purchases inventory. the following questions have been raised regarding the accounting for these types of transactions and are expected to be addressed by the eitf: (a) under what circumstances should two or more transactions with the same counterparty (counterparties) be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction within the scope of apb no. 29? (b) if nonmonetary transactions within the scope of apb no. 29 involve inventory, are there any circumstances under which the transactions should be recognized at fair value? the eitf has not yet addressed the first question. the eitf discussed the second question at its november 2004 meeting without reaching any consensus. if the eitf were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as monetary transactions on a gross basis, no change in our accounting policy for matching buy/sell transactions would be necessary. if the eitf were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions qualifying for fair value recognition and require a net presentation of such transactions, the amounts of revenues and cost of revenues associated with matching buy/sell transactions would be netted in our consolidated statement of income, but there would be no effect on income from operations, net income or cash flows from operations. if the eitf were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions not qualifying for fair value recognition, these amounts of revenues and cost of revenues would be netted in our consolidated statement of income and there could be an impact on income from operations and net income related to the timing of the ultimate sale of product purchased in the "buy" side of the matching buy/sell transaction. however, management does not believe any impact would be material. there would be no impact on cash flows from operations as a result of this accounting treatment. 32 management's discussion and analysis of income and operations revenues for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 e&amp;p $ 4,897 $ 4,811 $ 4,477 rm&amp;t 43,630 34,514 26,399 ig 1,739 2,248 1,217 segment revenues 50,266 41,573 32,093 elimination of intersegment revenues (668 ) (610 ) (798 ) total revenues $ 49,598 $

2004 from 2003 and by $334 million in 2003 from 2002. the 2004 increase was primarily due to higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices. this increase was partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes and decreased crude oil marketing activities. the 2003 increase was primarily due to higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices and increased crude oil marketing activities. this increase was partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes. derivative losses totaled $268 million in 2004, compared to losses of $176 million in 2003 and gains of $52 million in 2002. these results included losses of $99 million in 2004 compared to losses of $66 million in 2003 and gains of $18 million in 2002 related to long-term natural gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" on page 50 for discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. matching buy/sell transactions decreased by $55 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $67 million in 2003 from 2002. the 2004 and 2003 decreases were primarily due to decreased crude oil buy/sell transactions, partially offset by higher domestic liquid hydrocarbon prices. rm&amp;t segment revenues increased by $9.116 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $8.115 billion in 2003 from 2002. the increases primarily resulted from higher refined product selling prices and volumes and increased crude oil sales volumes and prices. matching buy/sell transactions increased by $2.061 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $2.745 billion in 2003 from 2002. the 2004 increase was primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon and refined product prices and increased crude oil and refined products buy/sell transaction volumes. the 2003 increase was primarily due to increased crude oil buy/sell transactions and higher liquid hydrocarbon and refined product prices, partially offset by lower refined product buy/sell transaction volumes. ig segment revenues decreased by $509 million in 2004 from 2003 and increased by $1.031 billion in 2003 from 2002. the decrease in 2004 is due to a decrease in natural gas marketing activities, partially offset by higher natural gas prices. the increase in 2003 is a result of higher natural gas prices and increased natural gas marketing activity. derivative gains totaled $17 million in 2004, compared to gains of $19 million in 2003 and losses of $8 million in 2002. for additional information on segment results, see the discussion on income from operations on page 35. income from equity method investments increased by $141 million in 2004 from 2003 and decreased by $108 million in 2003 from 2002. the increase in 2004 and decrease in 2003 is due to a $124 million loss on the dissolution of mkm partners l.p. ("mkm") recorded in 2003. results for 2004 also include increased earnings of other equity method investments, primarily atlantic methanol production company ("ampco"). the loss on the dissolution of mkm in 2003 was partially offset by increased earnings of other equity method investments due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons prices. for further discussion of the dissolution of mkm, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. net gains on disposal of assets decreased by $130 million in 2004 from 2003 and increased by $99 million in 2003 from 2002. results from 2004 include the sale of various ssa stores. during 2003, we sold our interest in clam petroleum b.v. ("clam"), interests in several pipeline companies, yates field and gathering system, ssa stores primarily in florida, south carolina, north carolina and georgia, and certain fields in the big horn basin of wyoming. results from 2002 include the sale of various ssa stores and the sale of san juan basin assets. 33 gain or loss on ownership change in map results from contributions to map of certain environmental capital expenditures and leased property acquisitions funded by marathon and ashland. in accordance with map's limited liability company agreement, in certain instances, environmental capital expenditures and acquisitions of leased properties are funded by the original contributor of the assets, but no change in ownership interest may result from these contributions. an excess of ashland funded improvements over marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of marathon funded improvements over ashland funded improvements results in a net loss. cost of revenues increased by $5.822 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $6.040 billion in 2003 from 2002. the increases are primarily in the rm&amp;t segment and result from higher acquisition costs for crude oil, refined products, refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $105 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $97 million in 2003 from 2002. the increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher costs associated with business transformation and outsourcing. our 2004 results were also impacted by start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea and the increased cost of complying with governmental regulations. the increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased employee benefit expenses (caused by increased pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and a decrease in realized returns on plan assets) and other employee related costs. additionally, during 2003, we recorded a charge of $24 million related to organizational and business process changes. inventory market valuation reserve ("imv") is established to reduce the cost basis of inventories to current market value. generally, we will establish an imv reserve when crude oil prices fall below $22 per barrel. the 2002 results of operations include credits to income from operations of $71 million, reversing the imv reserve at december 31, 2001. net interest and other financial costs decreased by $25 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $82 million in 2003 from 2002. the decrease in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income. the decrease in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased long-term construction projects, the favorable effect of interest rate swaps, the favorable effect of a reduction in interest on tax deficiencies and increased interest income on investments. additionally, included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency gains of $9 million, $13 million and $8 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002. loss from early extinguishment of debt in 2002 was attributable to the retirement of $337 million aggregate principal amount of debt, resulting in a loss of $53 million. minority interest in income of map, which represents ashland's 38 percent ownership interest, increased by $230 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $129 million in 2003 from 2002. map income was higher in 2004 compared to 2003 and in 2003 compared to 2002 as discussed below in the rm&amp;t segment. minority interest in loss of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited, which represents gepetrol's 25 percent ownership interest, was $7 million in 2004, primarily resulting from gepetrol's share of start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea. provision for income taxes increased by $143 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $215 million in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to $388 million and $720 million increases in income before income taxes. the effective tax rate for 2004 was 36.6 percent compared to 36.6 percent and 42.1 percent for 2003 and 2002. the higher rate in 2002 was due to the united kingdom enactment of a supplementary 10 percent tax on profits from the north sea oil and gas production, retroactively effective to april 17, 2002. in 2002, we recognized a one-time noncash deferred tax adjustment of $61 million as a result of the rate increase. the following is an analysis of the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2004 2003 2002 statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % effects of foreign operations (a) 1.3 (0.4 ) 5.6 state and local income taxes after federal income tax effects 1.6 2.2 3.9 other federal tax effects (1.3 ) (0.2 ) (2.4 ) effective tax rate 36.6 % 36.6 % 42.1 % (a) the deferred tax effect related to the enactment of a supplemental tax in the u.k. increased the effective tax rate 7.0 percent in 2002. 34 discontinued operations in 2003 primarily relates to our e&amp;p operations in western canada, which were sold in 2003 for a gain of $278 million, including a tax benefit of $8 million. also, included in 2003 results is an $8 million adjustment to a tax liability due to united states steel corporation. results for 2002 report the western canadian operations as discontinued. cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $4 million, net of a tax provision of $4 million, in 2003 represents the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no. 143 "accounting for asset retirement obligations" ("sfas no. 143"), in which we recognized in income the cumulative effect of recording the fair value of asset retirement obligations. the $13 million gain, net of a tax provision of $7 million, in 2002 represents the adoption of subsequently issued interpretations by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") of statement of financial accounting standards no. 133 "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities" ("sfas no. 133") in which we must recognize in income the effect of changes in the fair value of two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the united kingdom. net income decreased by $60 million in 2004 from 2003 and increased by $805 million in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to the factors discussed above. income from operations for each of the last three years is summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 e&amp;p domestic $ 1,073 $ 1,155 $ 726 international 623 425 333 e&amp;p segment income

an increase of $429 million in 2003 from 2002. the decrease in 2004 was due to lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes primarily resulting from natural declines in field production rates, weather-related downtime in the gulf of mexico and the sale of the yates field, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices. the increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices, lower dry well expense and a $25 million favorable contract settlement, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes and derivative losses. derivative losses totaled $118 million in 2004, compared to losses of $91 million in 2003 and gains of $32 million in 2002. in late september 2004, certain production platforms in the gulf of mexico were evacuated due to hurricane activity resulting in shut-in of approximately 40 thousand barrels per day ("mbpd") of liquid hydrocarbon and 95 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd") of natural gas production. restoration of production began following the hurricanes and all facilities were back on line by october 1, 2004 with the exception of the petronius platform which is expected to be back on line by the end of the second quarter 2005. at the time of shut-in, the petronius field was producing approximately 23.4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ("mboepd") net to marathon. as a result of the damage to the petronius platform, we recorded expense of $11 million representing repair costs incurred, partially offset by the net effects of the property damage insurance recoveries and the related retrospective insurance premiums. we also recorded income of $34 million for business interruption insurance recoveries. our domestic average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $32.76 per barrel ("bbl") in 2004, compared to $27.02 per bbl in 2003 and $22.35 per bbl in 2002. average gas prices were $4.89 per thousand cubic feet ("mcf") excluding derivative activity in 2004, compared with $4.53 per mcf in 2003 and $2.87 per mcf in 2002. domestic net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 27 percent to 81 mbpd in 2004, as a result of natural declines mainly in the gulf of mexico, hurricane damage to the petronius platform and the sale of yates field in november 2003. net natural gas production averaged 631 mmcfd, down 14 percent from 2003, as a result of hurricane damage to the petronius platform and natural declines in the permian basin and the gulf of mexico. domestic net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 11 percent to 111 mbpd in 2003, as a result of natural declines mainly in the gulf of mexico and dispositions. net natural gas production averaged 732 mmcfd, down 2 percent from 2002. international e&amp;p income increased by $198 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $92 million in 2003 from 2002. the increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and volumes partially offset by higher derivative losses. the increase in 2003 was due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices and higher liquid hydrocarbon volumes partially offset by lower natural gas volumes and derivative losses. derivative losses totaled $51 million in 2004, compared to losses of $19 million in 2003 and gains of $2 million in 2002. our international average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $33.68 per bbl in 2004, compared with $26.24 per bbl in 2003 and $23.85 per bbl in 2002. average gas prices were $3.33 per mcf excluding derivative activity in 2004, compared with $2.80 per mcf in 2003 and $2.35 per mcf in 2002. international net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 11 percent to 89 mbpd in 2004 primarily due to increased production in equatorial guinea and a full year of production from khanty mansiysk oil corporation ("kmoc") which was acquired in 2003. net natural gas production averaged 368 mmcfd, up 1 percent from 2003 due to increased production from the condensate expansion project in equatorial guinea, offset by the disposition in 2003 of our interest in clam. international net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 2 percent to 80 mbpd in 2003 primarily due to the acquisition of kmoc, partially offset by lower production in the u.k. net natural gas production averaged 364 mmcfd, down 5 percent from 2002, primarily from lower production in ireland and the disposition of our interest in clam. this decrease was partially offset by increased production in equatorial guinea. rm&amp;t segment income increased by $587 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $447 million in 2003 from 2002. the 2004 increase primarily results from a higher refining and wholesale marketing margin, which averaged 8.8 cents per gallon versus 6.0 cents in 2003. margins improved initially due to the market's concerns about refiners' ability to supply the new tier ii low sulfur gasolines which were required effective january 1, 2004 and, more recently, due to concerns about the adequacy of distillate supplies heading into winter. in addition, the widening of price differentials between sweet and sour crude positively affected the 2004 results. for the full year 2004 map averaged 939,000 barrels of crude oil throughput per day or 99 percent of average system capacity. the 2003 increase was primarily due to an improved refining and wholesale marketing margin, as well as a higher gasoline and 37 distillate retail gross margin partially offset by higher administrative expenses. the refining and wholesale marketing margin in 2003 averaged 6.0 cents per gallon, versus 2002 level of 3.9 cents. the gasoline and distillate gross margin for its retail business was 12.3 cents per gallon in 2003, as compared to 10.1 cents per gallon in 2002. the higher administrative expenses were due primarily to higher employee related costs. results for 2003 also included $34 million of gains from the sale of certain interests in refined product pipelines. derivative losses, which are included in the refining and wholesale marketing margin, were $272 million in 2004 compared to $158 million in 2003 and $124 million in 2002. these derivative losses were generally incurred to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories and to protect crack spread values. gains on the sale of ssa stores included in segment income were $17 million, $8 million and $37 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002. ig segment income increased by $51 million in 2004 from 2003, following a decrease of $26 million in 2003 from 2002. the increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in ampco and higher income from lng operations, partially offset by costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects and lower margins from gas marketing activities, including recognized changes in the fair value of derivatives used to support those activities. the ampco methanol plant in equatorial guinea operated at a 95 percent on-stream factor in 2004 and prices were strong, averaging nearly $227 per ton for the year. additionally, the 2003 results included an impairment charge of $22 million on an equity method investment and a loss of $17 million on the termination of two tanker operating leases. the decrease in 2003 is due to the impairment charge of $22 million and the loss of $17 million on leases as discussed above and higher expenses related to the development of an integrated gas business, partially offset by higher ampco earnings. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity financial condition current assets increased $2.823 billion from year-end 2003, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and receivables. the increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to the issuance on march 31, 2004, of 34,500,000 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $1.004 billion and the suspension of cash distributions to ashland. the increase in receivables was mainly due to higher year-end commodity prices. current liabilities increased $1.046 billion from year-end 2003, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable as a result of higher priced year-end crude oil purchases at map. investments and long-term receivables increased $223 million from year-end 2003, primarily due to contributions to an equity investee to fund the lpg expansion project in equatorial guinea and restricted cash of $66 million at egholdings. net property, plant and equipment increased $980 million from year-end 2003. net property, plant and equipment for each of the last two years is summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2004 2003 e&amp;p domestic $ 2,644 $ 2,636 international 3,530 3,351 total e&amp;p 6,174 5,987 rm&amp;t 4,842 4,492 ig 621 153 corporate 173 198 total $ 11,810 $ 10,830 the increase in international e&amp;p is due to the construction of the alba field condensate expansion project in equatorial guinea. the increase in rm&amp;t is primarily due to refinery upgrade projects to enable the production of low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel and the detroit, michigan refinery expansion project, partially offset by sales of ssa stores. the increase in ig is primarily due to costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea. long-term debt at december 31, 2004 was $4.057 billion, a decrease of $28 million from year-end 2003. see "liquidity and capital resources" on page 40, for further discussion. 38 asset retirement obligations increased $87 million from year-end 2003 primarily due to revisions of previous estimates caused by the impact of a weakening u.s. dollar on foreign asset retirement obligations, as well as drilling activity during 2004. cash flows net cash provided from operating activities (for continuing operations) totaled $3.730 billion in 2004, compared with $2.665 billion in 2003 and $2.331 billion in 2002. the increases mainly resulted from the effects of higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons prices and a higher refining and wholesale marketing margin. net cash provided from operating activities (for discontinued operations) totaled $83 million in 2003, compared with $69 million in 2002 related to our e&amp;p operations in western canada sold in 2003. capital expenditures for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 e&amp;p (a) domestic $ 402 $ 344 $ 417 international 542 629 403 total e&amp;p 944 973 820 rm&amp;t 784 772 621 ig 490 131 48 corporate 19 16 31 total $ 2,237 $ 1,892 $ 1,520 (a) amounts exclude the acquisitions of kmoc in 2003 and the equatorial guinea interests in 2002. capital expenditures in 2004 totaled $2.237 billion compared with $1.892 billion and $1.520 billion in 2003 and 2002, excluding the acquisitions of kmoc in 2003 and equatorial guinea interests in 2002. the $345 million increase in 2004 mainly resulted from increased spending in the ig segment associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea. the $372 million increase in 2003 mainly resulted from increased spending in the rm&amp;t segment at the catlettsburg refinery and on the cardinal products pipeline and in the e&amp;p segment in west africa and norway. the increase in ig in 2003 was due to the purchase of a 30 percent interest in two lng tankers which we previously leased and project development costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea. the decrease in corporate capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to the implementation of sap financial and operations software in prior years. acquisitions included cash payments of $252 million in 2003 for the acquisition of kmoc and $1.160 billion in 2002 for the acquisition of the interests in equatorial guinea. for further discussion of acquisitions, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. cash from disposal of assets was $76 million in 2004, compared with $1.256 billion including the disposal of discontinued operations, in 2003 and $146 million in 2002. in 2004, proceeds were primarily from the sale of certain ssa stores and various domestic producing properties. in 2003, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of our e&amp;p properties in western canada, the yates field and gathering system, our interest in clam, various ssa stores, our interest in several pipeline companies and certain fields in the big horn basin of wyoming. in 2002, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of various ssa stores and the sale of our san juan basin assets. net cash provided from financing activities totaled $527 million in 2004, compared with net cash used of $888 million in 2003 and net cash provided of $88 million in 2002. the increase in 2004 was due to $1.004 billion in net proceeds from the march 31, 2004, issuance of 34,500,000 shares of common stock as well as the suspension of distributions to the minority shareholder of map. this was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to stockholders. the decrease in 2003 was due to activity in 2002 primarily associated with financing the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests of $1.160 billion. this was partially offset by the $295 million repayment of preferred securities in 2002 that became redeemable or were converted to a right to receive cash upon the separation. in early january 2002, we paid $185 million to retire the 6.75% convertible quarterly income preferred securities and $110 million to retire the 6.50% cumulative convertible preferred stock. 39 derivative instruments see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" on page 50, for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. dividends to stockholders on january 23, 2005, our board of directors declared a dividend of 28 cents per share on our common stock, payable march 10, 2005, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 16, 2005. liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. our ability to access the debt capital market is supported by our investment grade credit ratings. because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007, and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor's corporation, moody's investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+, baa1, and bbb+, respectively. our investment-grade credit ratings were affirmed by these agencies following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of ashland's 38 percent ownership interest in map. we have a committed $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that terminates in may 2009. at december 31, 2004, there were no borrowings against this facility. at december 31, 2004, we had no commercial paper outstanding under the u.s. commercial paper program that is backed by the five-year revolving credit facility. additionally, we have other uncommitted short-term lines of credit totaling $200 million, of which no amounts were drawn at december 31, 2004. map has a committed $500 million five-year revolving credit facility with third-party financial institutions that terminates in may 2009. map also has a $190 million revolving credit agreement with ashland that expires in march 2005. at december 31, 2004, there were no borrowings against these facilities. pursuant to the terms of our agreement to acquire the 38 percent ownership interest in map currently held by ashland (see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements), map's use of its credit agreement with ashland was restricted after september 30, 2004 and we anticipate the credit agreement will be terminated if the transaction is completed. the marathon and map revolving credit facilities each require a representation at an initial borrowing that there has been no change in the respective borrower's consolidated financial position or operations, considered as a whole, that would materially and adversely affect such borrower's ability to perform its obligations under its revolving credit facility. on march 31, 2004, we completed the sale of 34,500,000 shares of common stock at the offering price of $30 per share from the $2.7 billion universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in 2002. we recorded net proceeds of $1.004 billion related to this issuance. as of december 31, 2004 there was $1.7 billion aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities and/or other securities, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for other equity or debt securities available to be issued under this shelf registration statement. cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.369 billion at december 31, 2004, as compared to $1.396 billion at december 31, 2003. we expect to utilize a substantial portion of this cash to repay debt assumed in connection with the proposed acquisition of ashland's interest in map and related businesses, to retire other outstanding long-term debt or for other general corporate purposes. cash distributions from map have been suspended pending consummation of the agreement to acquire the 38 percent ownership interest in map currently held by ashland. if the proposed transaction closes, ashland would receive additional proceeds equal to 38 percent of map's distributable cash at the time of closing. if the transaction does not close, ashland would receive its share of these funds as part of map's normal distributions. ashland's share on december 31, 2004 was $574 million. 40 our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total-debt-minus-cash to total-debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 8 percent at december 31, 2004, compared to 33 percent at year-end 2003 as shown below. this includes approximately $594 million of debt that is serviced by united states steel corporation ("united states steel") and the above suspended distributions to ashland. we continually monitor our spending levels, market conditions and related interest rates to maintain what we perceive to be reasonable debt levels.

(b) we anticipate cash payments for interest of $251 million for 2005, $453 million for 2006-2007, $383 million for 2008-2009 and $1.596 billion for the remaining years for a total of $2.683 billion. (c) the majority of 2005's contractual obligations to purchase crude oil, refinery feedstock and refined products relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of the year. (d) we have acquired the right to deliver to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal 58 bcf of natural gas per year. the agreement's primary term ends in 2021. pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the lng re-gasification terminal. 41 (e) services and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (f) we are a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with alliance pipeline. this agreement is used by alliance pipeline to secure its financing. this arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our guarantee. (g) commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs. (h) we have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. we have estimated projected funding requirements through 2014. (i) includes $694 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. for additional information, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel" on page 43. contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded from the above table. these include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors. our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources; and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. we have provided various forms of guarantees to unconsolidated affiliates, united states steel and certain lease contracts. these arrangements are described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. we are a party to agreements that would require us to purchase, under certain circumstances, the interests in map and in pilot travel centers llc ("ptc") not currently owned. these put/call agreements are described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. we are party to an agreement that would require us to sell, under certain circumstances, a 13 percent interest in egholdings to gepetrol at historical cost plus an additional specified rate of return for a period of one year from the date of project sanction. this agreement is described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. nonrecourse indebtedness of investees certain of our equity investees have incurred indebtedness that we do not support through guarantees or otherwise. if we were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata ownership basis, our share would have been approximately $299 million as of december 31, 2004. of this amount, $170 million relates to ptc. if any of these equity investees default, we have no obligation to support the debt. our partner in ptc has guaranteed $157 million of the total ptc debt. 42 obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary, united states steel, to holders of its usx u. s. steel group class of common stock ("steel stock") in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis (the "separation"). we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. united states steel's obligations to marathon are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel's accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. if united states steel fails to satisfy these obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. as of december 31, 2004, we have identified the following obligations totaling $671 million that have been assumed by united states steel: $472 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $8 million at december 31, 2004. $71 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel's fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2004. $51 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel's clairton cokemaking facility, with a term extending to 2012. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2004. $55 million of operating lease obligations, of which $42 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee of united states steel's $14 million contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent owned joint venture pro-tec coating company. a guarantee of all obligations of united states steel as general partner of clairton 1314b partnership, l.p. to the limited partners. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. for further discussion of the clairton 1314b guarantee, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $671 million, obligations of $602 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet (current portion $15 million; long-term portion $587 million). the remaining $69 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. the table below provides aggregated information on the portion of our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by united states steel as of december 31, 2004: summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel (dollars in millions) total 2005 2006- 2007 2008- 2009 later

anticipate cash payments for interest of $27 million for 2005, $53 million for 2006-2007, $53 million for 2008-2009 and $53 million for the later years to be assumed by united states steel. each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during taxable periods ended on or before december 31, 2001, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for those periods. marathon and united states steel have entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended on or before december 31, 2001. 43 the agreement includes indemnification provisions to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party. in 2003, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement, we paid $16 million to united states steel in connection with the settlement with the internal revenue service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of usx corporation for the years 1992 through 1994. united states steel reported in its form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2004, that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. however, united states steel management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. during periods of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the u.s. economy, united states steel believes that it can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending, sale of non-strategic assets and other cash conservation measures. transactions with related parties we own a combined 63 percent working interest in the alba field. we own a net 52 percent interest in an onshore lpg processing plant through an equity method investee, alba plant llc. additionally, we own a 45 percent interest in an onshore methanol production plant through ampco, an equity method investee. we sell our marketed natural gas from the alba field to alba plant llc and ampco. ampco uses the natural gas to manufacture methanol and sells the methanol through another equity method investee, ampco marketing llc. map's related party sales to its 50 percent equity method investee, ptc, consists primarily of refined petroleum products which accounted for approximately 2 percent of its total sales revenue for 2004 and 2003. ptc is the largest travel center network in the united states and operates approximately 250 travel centers nationwide. map also sells refined petroleum products consisting mainly of petrochemicals, base lube oils, and asphalt to ashland which owns a 38 percent interest in map. map's sales to ashland accounted for approximately 1 percent of its total sales revenue for 2004 and 2003. we believe that these transactions were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. in 2004, marathon and gepetrol announced that all of the necessary agreements had been finalized for a lng plant, including the formation of the jointly-owned holding company egholdings. marathon holds a 75 percent economic interest and gepetrol holds a 25 percent economic interest in egholdings. as of december 31, 2004, total expenditures of $551 million, including $524 million of capital expenditures, related to the lng project have been incurred. cash held in escrow of $66 million to fund future contributions from gepetrol is classified as restricted cash and is included in investments and long-term receivables. payables to related parties include $23 million payable to gepetrol. management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately recovered in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. our environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were (a) : (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 capital $ 433 $ 331 $ 128 compliance operating &amp; maintenance 215 243 205 remediation (b) 32 44 45 total $ 680 $ 618 $ 378 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines and include 100 percent of map. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. 44 our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 19 percent of total capital expenditures in 2004, 17 percent in 2003, and eight percent in 2002. we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. we have been notified that we are a potentially responsible party ("prp") at six waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("cercla") as of december 31, 2004. in addition, there is one site where we have received information requests or other indications that we may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is presently unavailable to confirm the existence of liability. at many of these sites, we are one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well as our share thereof, is frequently dependent on the outcome of investigations and remedial studies. there are also 131 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. of these sites, 14 were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland for which ashland has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $438 million or 15 percent of capital expenditures in 2005. predictions beyond 2005 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $200 million in 2006; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. new tier ii gasoline and on-road diesel fuel rules require substantially reduced sulfur levels for gasoline and diesel starting in 2004 and 2006, respectively. the combined capital costs to achieve compliance with the gasoline and diesel regulations could amount to approximately $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006 and includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. this is a forward-looking statement. costs incurred through december 31, 2004, were approximately $520 million. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include completion of project detailed engineering, construction and start-up activities. map has had a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general's office since 2002 concerning map's self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its robinson, illinois refinery. map has had periodic discussions with illinois officials regarding this matter and more discussions may occur in 2005. during 2001, map entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act ("caa") and other violations with the u. s. environmental protection agency covering all of map's refineries. the settlement committed map to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to map's refineries over approximately an eight-year period. the total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately $370 million over the eight-year period, with about $240 million incurred through december 31, 2004. the impact of the settlement on ongoing operating expenses is expected to be immaterial. in addition, map has nearly completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations, at a cost of $9 million. we believe this settlement will provide map with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions. 45 other contingencies we are a defendant along with many other refining companies in over forty cases in eleven states alleging methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("mtbe") contamination in groundwater. the plaintiffs generally are water providers or governmental authorities and they allege that refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing mtbe are liable for manufacturing a defective product and that owners and operators of retail gasoline sites have allowed mtbe to be discharged into the groundwater. several of these lawsuits allege contamination that is outside of our marketing area. a few of the cases seek approval as class actions. many of the cases seek punitive damages or treble damages under a variety of statutes and theories. we stopped producing mtbe at our refineries in october 2002. the potential impact of these recent cases and future potential similar cases is uncertain. we will defend these cases vigorously. we are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. however, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to us. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources." sec inquiry relating to equatorial guinea by letter dated july 15, 2004, the united states securities and exchange commission ("sec") notified marathon that it was conducting an inquiry into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea, or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea. this inquiry follows an investigation and public hearing conducted by the united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, which reviewed the transactions of various foreign governments, including that of equatorial guinea, with riggs bank. the investigation and hearing also reviewed the operations of u.s. oil companies, including marathon, in equatorial guinea. there was no finding in the subcommittee's report that marathon violated the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or any other applicable laws or regulations. the investigation is ongoing and marathon is cooperating fully with the sec inquiry. outlook capital, investment and exploration budget we approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $2.98 billion for 2005. the primary focus of the 2005 budget is to find additional oil and gas reserves, develop existing fields, strengthen rm&amp;t assets and continue implementation of the integrated gas strategy. the budget includes worldwide production capital spending of $1.219 billion primarily in u.s, norway, russia, equatorial guinea, ireland, and the u.k. the worldwide exploration budget of $364 million includes plans to drill 15 significant exploration wells in the gulf of mexico, angola, norway and other areas. other activities will focus on projects primarily in the united states. the budget includes $804 million for rm&amp;t projects, primarily for refinery expansion and upgrading projects, as well as investments necessary to meet required low sulfur (tier ii) gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel specifications. the integrated gas budget of $481 million is primarily for the ongoing construction of the lng plant in equatorial guinea. the remaining $111 million balance is designated for corporate activities and capitalized interest. exploration and production our six discoveries in 2004 result from our balanced exploration strategy which places greater emphasis on near-term production and lower risk opportunities, while retaining an appropriate exposure to longer-term options. major exploration activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include those in: equatorial guinea, where we are evaluating development scenarios for the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, one of which includes production through the alba field infrastructure and the future lng facility under construction on bioko island. we own a 63 percent interest in the alba block and serve as operator. we plan to drill one additional exploration well in 2005 in equatorial guinea. norway, where hamsun well results are being analyzed and development scenarios are being examined including a possible tie-back to the alvheim development. we own a 65 percent interest in hamsun and serve as operator. in addition, we acquired four new norwegian exploration licenses (three operated) in the december 2004 apa license round. we now own interests in sixteen licenses in the norwegian sector of the north sea and plan to drill two to three exploration wells during 2005. 46 offshore angola, where development options for the northeast development area of block 31, which includes the plutao, saturno, marte and venus discoveries, are currently being evaluated. also on block 31, the palas well in the southern portion was recently announced as a discovery and the ceres well in the central portion has reached total depth and results will be announced when government approval is received. we own a 10 percent interest in block 31. on angola block 32, in which we own a 30 percent interest, additional drilling will be required to determine commerciality of the cola prospect and the results of the gengibre well will be announced following government approval. we plan to participate in six exploration wells offshore angola during 2005. gulf of mexico, where development options for the neptune unit are being assessed and front end engineering and design is anticipated to result in project sanction in 2005. we own a 30 percent interest in the neptune unit. we plan to participate in three to four wells in the gulf of mexico during 2005. during 2004, we continued to make progress in advancing key development projects that will help serve as the basis for our production growth profile in the coming years. major development and production activities currently underway or under evaluation include those in: norway, where our approved alvheim pdo will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading ("fpso") vessel with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. tendering for all major construction contracts was completed in early 2005, including contracts for fpso topsides construction and hull modifications. the approved alvheim pdo includes the kneler, boa and kameleon fields in which we own a 65 percent interest and serve as operator. a pdo for the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, was submitted by the operator, to the norwegian government in december 2004 and approval is expected in 2005. the combined alvheim/vilje developments are expected to ramp up production to more than 50,000 boepd during 2007. equatorial guinea, where we continued our expansion programs with the completion and continued ramp-up of production from the condensate expansion project. as of year-end 2004, gross condensate production averaged approximately 45,800 bpd. at full capacity, the condensate expansion will increase total liquids production to approximately 57,000 gross bpd (32,000 bpd net to marathon). our lpg expansion project is on schedule for start-up during the second quarter of 2005. the project is mechanically complete and commissioning is in progress. when the lpg expansion is completed, gross liquids production will increase to approximately 79,000 bpd (44,500 bpd net) during the second half of 2005. ireland, where the an bord plean&aacute;la announced that it has upheld the mayo county council's decision to grant planning permission for the proposed natural gas terminal at bellanaboy bridge, county mayo, which is to be built to bring gas from the corrib field ashore. this decision represents a major step forward for the corrib gas project, in which we own an 18.5 percent interest. construction began in december and first gas production is targeted for 2007. russia, where we expect to drill approximately 70 wells in 2005. wyoming's powder river basin, where we plan to drill approximately 500 coal bed natural gas wells in 2005. libya, where we continue to work with our partners, including the libyan government, to finalize the terms of the group's reentry agreement following the lifting of u.s. sanctions in early 2004. the parties continue to make progress toward a final agreement and we are optimistic that it will be finalized in the near future. we own a 16.33 percent interest in the approximately 13 million acre waha concession. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of our worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, future exploration and drilling activity, the alvheim/vilje developments, the lpg expansion project and the corrib gas project. some factors that could potentially affect worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas and condensate production, the exploration and drilling activities and the alvheim development include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, occurrence of acquisitions/dispositions of oil and gas properties, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. in addition to the foregoing factors, the plan for development and operation of the vilje field may be affected by delays in obtaining norwegian regulatory approval. some factors that could affect the lpg expansion project and the corrib gas project include unforeseen problems arising from construction and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. the forward-looking information related to production is based on certain assumptions, including, among others, presently known physical data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology development, future drilling success, production experience, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and operating conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 47 refining, marketing and transportation throughout 2004, map remained focused on its strategy of leveraging refining and marketing investments in core markets, as well as expanding and enhancing its asset base while controlling costs. the record refinery throughput performance was achieved even though the company had undertaken a significant number of planned turnarounds during the first quarter of 2004 at the garyville, louisiana; catlettsburg, kentucky; and canton, ohio, refineries. assuming refining margins remain strong in 2005, we expect map's 2005 average crude oil throughput to exceed that achieved in 2004. the detroit refinery expansion project remains on schedule for completion in late 2005. this project will increase the refinery's crude processing capacity from 74,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd as well as enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. marathon is loaning map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. on march 18, 2004, we entered into an agreement with ashland inc. to acquire its 38 percent interest in map, along with a portion of its valvoline instant oil change business and its maleic anhydride business. the proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including favorable private letter rulings from the internal revenue service ("irs"), opinions of outside tax counsel, ashland shareholder approval, ashland public debt holder consents, and updated ashland solvency opinions. with respect to the tax treatment of the transaction, marathon and ashland are discussing with the irs possible modifications of the transaction that would allow a tax efficient transfer of the map interest. any such modifications would require marathon and ashland to amend the master agreement executed by the parties on march 18, 2004. however, there can be no assurance that an agreement on a modified transaction will be reached. if an agreement is reached on a modified transaction, it is likely the transaction would close in the second quarter of 2005. for additional information, see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to projections of crude oil throughput, the detroit refinery expansion project, the proposed acquisition of ashland's 38 percent interest in map and other related businesses and the anticipated effects of private letter rulings from the irs with respect to the tax treatment of the map transaction. some factors that could affect crude oil throughput include planned and unplanned refinery maintenance projects, the level of refining margins, and other operating considerations. the detroit refinery expansion project may be affected by the availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. some factors that could affect the completion of the acquisition of ashland's 38 percent interest in map and other related businesses include modifications to the transaction, an adverse ruling from the irs regarding certain tax basis issues, opinions of outside tax counsel, ashland shareholder approval, ashland public debt holder consents and updated ashland solvency opinions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas we continued to progress our integrated gas strategy throughout the year. this strategy is designed to complement our exploration and production operations focusing on accessing low cost stranded natural gas resources and adding value by applying technology and commercial skills to connect those resources to the major consuming markets. construction of the equatorial guinea lng project is on schedule for shipment of first cargoes of lng in late 2007. this project is expected to be one of the lowest cost lng operations in the atlantic basin with an all-in lng operating, capital and feedstock cost of approximately $1 per million british thermal units ("mmbtu") at the loading flange of the lng plant. efforts are underway to acquire additional gas supply and expand the utilization of this lng facility above and beyond the contract to supply 3.4 million metric tons per year to bg gas marketing ltd. for 17 years. we also are seeking additional natural gas supplies in the area to expand the capacity and life of this plant and that could lead to the development of a second lng train. under the five year bp supply agreement, we will begin taking delivery of lng at the elba island, georgia, lng regasification terminal during the second half of 2005. at the elba island terminal, we hold rights to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas per year through 2021, with an option to extend for five years. this supply agreement with bp enables us to fully utilize our capacity rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded gas resources beyond the term of the bp contract. we continue to actively seek lng cargoes before the start of deliveries from bp. 48 in 2005, we plan to continue exploring and investing in gas technology research, including gtl technology, which was successfully applied in the catoosa gtl demonstration plant in 2004. in addition to gtl, we are researching and developing expertise in methanol to power, gas to gasoline and compressed natural gas technologies. the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the estimated construction of a lng project. factors that could affect the proposed lng project and related facilities include unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. corporate matters in 2004, as part of ongoing business transformation programs, we implemented two outsourcing agreements to achieve further business process improvements and cost reductions. it is anticipated that these programs will result in total pretax charges of approximately $70 million. of these charges, $24 million was recorded in 2003 and $43 million was recorded in 2004, including net settlement and curtailment gains of $10 million in 2003 and losses of $20 million in 2004, on employee benefit plans. projected savings from the business transformation programs are expected to benefit all business segments. accounting standards not yet adopted during december 2004, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no. 123 (revised 2004) "share-based payment" ("sfas no. 123r") as a revision of statement of financial accounting standard no. 123 "accounting for stock based compensation". this statement requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. in addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. in 2003, marathon adopted the fair value method for grants made, modified or settled on or after january 1, 2003. accordingly, management does not expect the adoption of sfas no. 123r to have a material affect on results of operations, financial position or cash flows. this statement is effective for marathon on july 1, 2005. marathon has not yet determined whether to adopt this standard earlier than the effective date. 49 item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. we use commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. to a lesser extent, we are exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and on petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials. our strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. we will use a variety of derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses. as market conditions change, we evaluate our risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of commodity-based derivatives will be based on market prices. our e&amp;p segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on portions of our future production when deemed advantageous to do so. we also use financial derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure on foreign currency denominated capital investment expenditures, operating expenses and foreign tax payments. our rm&amp;t segment uses commodity derivative instruments: to mitigate the price risk between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products, to manage the price risk associated with anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use, to protect the value of excess refined product, crude oil and lpg inventories, to lock in margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers, to protect against decreases in future crack spreads, to mitigate price risk associated with freight on crude, feedstocks, and refined product deliveries, and to take advantage of trading opportunities identified in the commodity markets. our ig segment is exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas. we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes. we use financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposures. as we enter into these derivatives, assessments are made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting. we believe that use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material risk. however, the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity. 50 commodity price risk sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations ("ifo") of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, are provided in the following table: (a) (in millions) derivative commodity instruments (b)(c) 10% 25% 10% 25% crude oil (d) $ 1.3 (e) $ $ 28.3 (e) $ 87.9 (e) natural gas (e) 36.3 (e) 90.7 (e) 29.1 (e) 73.5 (e) refined products (e) 2.6 (f) 7.4 (f) 3.6 (e) 9.1 (e) (a) we remain at risk for future changes in the market value of derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. effects of these offsets are not reported in the sensitivity analyses. amounts assume hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in closing commodity prices, excluding basis swaps, for each open contract position at december 31, 2004 and 2003. we evaluate our portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. the creditworthiness of counterparties is reviewed continuously and master netting agreements are used when practical. changes to the portfolio after december 31, 2004, would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented in the table. (b) net open contracts for the combined e&amp;p and ig segments varied throughout 2004, from a low of 1 contract at december 15 to a high of 39,683 contracts at january 1, and averaged 19,344 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the rm&amp;t segment varied throughout 2004, from a low of 253 contracts at july 7 to a high of 23,138 contracts at october 13, and averaged 11,437 for the year. the derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects. (c) the calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated. gains and losses on options are based on changes in intrinsic value only. (d) the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity is based on the largest incremental decrease in ifo when applied to the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge that commodity. (e) price increase. (f) price decrease. e&amp;p segment derivative losses included in the e&amp;p segment were $169 million in 2004 compared to losses of $110 million in 2003 and gains of $34 million in 2002. additionally, losses from discontinued cash flow hedges of $3 million are included in 2004 segment results, compared to losses of $8 million in 2003 and gains of $23 million in 2002. the discontinued cash flow hedge amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur. excluded from the e&amp;p segment results were losses of $99 million in 2004, losses of $66 million in 2003 and gains of $18 million in 2002 on long-term gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. for additional information on u.k. gas contracts, see "estimated fair value of derivative contracts" on page 31. at december 31, 2004, we had no open equity production derivative contracts. we evaluate the commodity price risk of our equity production on an ongoing basis and may enter into commodity derivative instruments when it is deemed advantageous. 51 rm&amp;t segment we do not attempt to qualify commodity derivative instruments used in our rm&amp;t operations for hedge accounting. as a result, we recognize all changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our rm&amp;t operations in income, although most of these derivatives have an underlying physical commodity transaction. generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transactions. conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying physical commodity transactions. derivative gains or losses included in rm&amp;t segment income for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: strategy (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 mitigate price risk $ (106 ) $ (112 ) $ (95 ) protect carrying values of excess inventories (98 ) (57 ) (41 ) protect margin on fixed price sales 8 5 11 protect crack spread values (76 ) 6 1 trading activities 8 (4 ) total net derivative losses $ (264 ) $ (162 ) $ (124 ) during 2004, using derivative instruments map sold crack spreads forward through the fourth quarter 2005 at values higher than the company thought sustainable in the actual months these contracts expire. included in the $76 million derivative loss for 2004 noted in the above table for the "protect crack spread values" strategy was approximately an $8 million gain due to changes in the fair value of crack-spread derivatives that will expire throughout 2005. in addition, natural gas options are in place to manage the price risk associated with approximately 41 percent of the first quarter 2005 anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use. ig segment we have used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. the underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. similarly, we will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term (typically less than a year) fixed price contracts to market prices in our ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. derivative gains included in ig segment income were $17 million in 2004, compared to gains of $19 million in 2003 and losses of $8 million in 2002. trading activity in the ig segment resulted in losses of $2 million in 2004, compared to losses of $7 million in 2003 and gains of $4 million in 2002 and have been included in the aforementioned amounts. other commodity risk we are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. for example, new york mercantile exchange ("nymex") contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana's henry hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices. if commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. these regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. otc transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk. we are impacted by liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position. due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions. 52 interest rate risk we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations which affect the fair value of certain financial instruments. a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table: (in millions) financial instruments (a) fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) financial assets (liabilities): investments and long-term receivables $ 266 $ $ 186 $ interest rate swap agreements $ (10 ) $ 14 $ 4 $ 16 long-term debt (d)(e) $ (4,480 ) $ (164 ) $ (4,740 ) $ (176 ) (a) fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. (b) see note 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for carrying value of instruments. (c) for long-term debt, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of our long-term debt at december 31, 2004 and 2003. for interest rate swap agreements, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the effective swap rate at december 31, 2004 and 2003. (d) includes amounts due within one year. (e) fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. at december 31, 2004 and 2003, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. this sensitivity is illustrated by the $164 million increase in the fair value of long-term debt assuming a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates. however, our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio would unfavorably affect our results and cash flows only if we would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value. we have initiated a program to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio. we have entered into several interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. the following table summarizes, by individual debt instrument, the interest rate swap activity as of december 31, 2004: floating rate to be paid fixed rate to be received notional amount swap maturity fair value six month libor +4.226% 6.650 % $300 million 2006 $(2) million six month libor +1.935% 5.375 % $450 million 2007 $(1) million six month libor +3.285% 6.850 % $400 million 2008 $(2) million six month libor +2.142% 6.125 % $200 million 2012 $(5) million 53 foreign currency exchange rate risk we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward contracts, generally with terms of 365 days or less. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our exposure to movements in the foreign currency markets by locking in foreign currency rates. at december 31, 2004, the following commodity derivatives were outstanding. all contracts currently qualify for hedge accounting unless noted. financial instruments period notional amount all-in-rate (a) fair value foreign currency rate swaps euro january 2005 july 2005 $89 million 1.257 (c) $7 million norwegian kroner january 2005 december 2005 $49 million (b) 6.213 (d) $1 million british pound sterling january 2005 september 2005 $6 million 1.759 (c) $1 million (a) the rate at which the derivative instruments will be settled. (b) on december 31, 2004, $18 million was discontinued and no longer qualified for hedge accounting. on january 31, 2005, this amount was re-qualified for hedge accounting. (c) u.s. dollar to foreign currency. (d) foreign currency to u.s. dollar. the aggregate effect on foreign exchange contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change to year-end exchange rates would be approximately $15 million. credit risk we are exposed to significant credit risk from united states steel arising from the separation. that exposure is discussed in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel" on page 42. safe harbor these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management's opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and other feedstocks. if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to our hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 54risk factors risk factors, item 3. legal proceedings, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "plan," "predict" "target," "project," "could," "may," "should," "would" or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the "separation"), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ("steel stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ("united states steel") to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and since that date, marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ("map") previously held by ashland inc. ("ashland"). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland's valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions (the "acquisition"), map is now wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ("mpc") effective september 1, 2005. segment and geographic information our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) exploration and production ("e&amp;p") explores for, produces and markets crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) refining, marketing and transportation ("rm&amp;t") refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states; and 3) integrated gas ("ig") markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ("lng") and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 2 exploration and production (in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to "net" wells, production or sales indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.) we conduct exploration, development and production activities in ten countries, with a focus on international growth while continuing to maintain our position in the united states. principal exploration activities were in the united states, norway, angola and indonesia. principal development and production activities were in the united states, the united kingdom, norway, equatorial guinea and libya. our 2006 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations averaged 223 thousand barrels per day ("mbpd"), an increase of 36 percent from 2005 levels. our 2006 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 847 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd"), a decrease of 9 percent compared to 2005. in total, our 2006 worldwide net sales from continuing operations averaged 365 thousand barrels of oil equivalent ("mboe") per day, compared to 319 mboe per day in 2005. (for purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ("mcf") by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.) in 2007, our worldwide net production available for sale is expected to average 390 to 425 mboe per day, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions. the above projections of 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production available for sale volumes are forward-looking statements. some factors that could potentially affect levels of production available for sale include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability to or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. exploration in the united states during 2006, we drilled 33 gross (16 net) exploratory wells of which 21 gross (10 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 21 wells, 6 gross (4 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of completing at year end. internationally, we drilled 21 gross (4 net) exploratory wells of which 16 gross (3 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 16 wells, 9 gross (3 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2006. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for us. at the end of 2006, we had interests in 129 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 100 in the deepwater area. during 2006, we increased our interest from 20 percent to 30 percent in the stones prospect (walker ridge block 508). an appraisal well is planned for 2007 on this outside-operated 2005 discovery. in 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the ozona prospect (garden banks block 515) in the gulf of mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was successful. we are continuing to evaluate options to develop the ozona prospect. commercial terms have been secured for the tie-back and processing of ozona production and we have been actively searching for a rig to drill the development well. we hold a 68 percent operated interest in the ozona prospect. a well on the flathead prospect (walker ridge block 30) in the gulf of mexico was suspended in 2002. technical evaluations are complete and commercial evaluations continued in 2006. the drilling of this prospect is delayed due to the shortage of available deepwater rigs. we continue to pursue partnering opportunities with other oil and gas companies that have deepwater rigs under contract. we hold a 100 percent operated interest in the flathead prospect. norway we hold interests in over 700,000 gross acres offshore norway and plan to continue our exploration effort there. in 2006, we participated in a successful appraisal well on the gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast. marathon holds a 28 percent outside-operated interest in gudrun where we are primarily focused on evaluating development scenarios. angola offshore angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in block 32. through february 2007, we have announced 20 discoveries on these blocks. we have 3 also participated in four wells that have reached total depth, the results of which will be announced upon government and partner approvals. we expect to participate in 10 or 11 wells on these blocks in 2007. on block 31, four previously announced discoveries (plutao, saturno, marte and venus) and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of the block. also on block 31, we had five previously announced discoveries located in the southeastern portion of the block (palas, ceres, juno, astraea and hebe). in 2006 and early 2007, we announced discoveries at urano, titania, terra and an unnamed well. we are integrating the results of these wells with our previously announced discoveries. on block 32, we previously announced three discoveries (gindungo, canela and gengibre). in 2006, we announced the fourth discovery on block 32, the mostarda-1, and a successful deepwater delineation well, gengibre-2. we also announced that hydrocarbons were encountered in the salsa well, but additional drilling is required to assess its commerciality. in early 2007, we announced two additional discoveries, the manjericao and caril wells. these discoveries move block 32 closer toward establishment of a commercial development. equatorial guinea during 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the alba block offshore equatorial guinea. the deep luba discovery well, drilled from the alba field production platform, encountered natural gas and condensate in several pay zones. the gardenia discovery well is located 11 miles southwest of the alba field. we are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the deep luba and gardenia discoveries. we hold a 63 percent operated interest in the alba block. in 2004, we announced the results of the corona well drilled on block d offshore equatorial guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent working interest. the corona well confirmed an extension of the alba field on to block d. an application for an area of commercial discovery was submitted prior to the end of the production sharing contract's exploration period, which expired at the end of 2006. we are currently in discussions with the equatorial guinea government regarding our rights to develop the block d extension of the alba field. libya we hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2006 included the drilling of 12 wells, nine of which were successful. most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations. canada we are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the annapolis lease offshore nova scotia, where we continue to evaluate further drilling. in late 2006, we decided to withdraw from the adjacent cortland lease, where we hold a 75 percent interest, and the adjacent empire lease, where we hold a 50 percent interest. as a result of this withdrawal, a charge equal to 25 percent of the remaining work commitment, or $47 million, was recorded as exploration expense in 2006 and the cash payment will be due to the canadian provincial government in 2007. indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin oil and natural gas production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006. we expect to begin collecting geophysical data in 2007, followed by exploratory drilling in 2008 and 2009. production (including development activities) united states our u.s. operation accounted for 34 percent of our 2006 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations and 63 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. during 2006, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 35 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 46 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 43 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 8 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon sales in the gulf of mexico increased slightly from the prior year, mainly due to the effects of five tropical storms/hurricanes in 2005. net natural gas sales decreased by 41 mmcfd from the prior year primarily because natural gas sales from the camden hills field ended in early 2006 as a result of increased water production. at year-end 2006, we held interests in seven producing fields and eight platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which four platforms are operated by marathon. the majority of our sales in the gulf of mexico comes from the petronius development in viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. we own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in these blocks. the platform provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. for example, petronius processes the production from our perseus field which commenced production in april 2005 and is located five miles from the platform. 4 we hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest in the neptune deepwater development on atwater valley blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the gulf of mexico, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the initial development plan for neptune was sanctioned in 2005 and includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone mini-tension leg platform. construction of the platform and facility continued through 2006 with first production expected in early 2008. we are one of the largest natural gas producers in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2006, our alaskan net natural gas sales averaged 156 mmcfd, representing 29 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. in may 2006, upon receipt of regulatory approvals, we began to produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. the natural gas in storage will be used to manage supplies to meet contractual demand. in addition to our operations in other established alaskan fields, production from the ninilchik field began in 2003 and development continues on the field. ninilchik natural gas is transported through the 35-mile portion of the kenai kachemak pipeline which connects ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the kenai peninsula, in anchorage and in other parts of south central alaska. we operate ninilchik and own a 60 percent interest in it and the section of the kenai kachemak pipeline described above. our 2006 development program in the cook inlet included participation in the drilling of seven wells. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from our wyoming fields averaged 21 mbpd in 2006 and 2005. net natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 119 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 107 mmcfd in 2005. the increase in our wyoming net natural gas sales is primarily attributed to higher net sales from the powder river basin, which averaged 77 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 66 mmcfd in 2005 as a result of 2005 drilling activity. development of the powder river basin continued in 2006 with 119 wells drilled, which was down from the 195 wells drilled in 2005 due to project delays primarily caused by regulatory and produced water management issues. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2006 where we participated in the drilling of 27 wells. net natural gas sales from our oklahoma fields averaged 87 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 77 mmcfd in 2005 primarily as a result of development and exploratory drilling. our 2006 development program continued to focus in the anadarko basin where we participated in the drilling of 75 wells. net natural gas sales from our east texas and north louisiana fields averaged 71 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 75 mmcfd in 2005. this decrease is primarily attributable to sour gas handling capacity limits at the natural gas plants that purchase our east texas natural gas, partially offset by development drilling results. active development of the mimms creek field in east texas continued in 2006. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the permian basin region, which extends from southeast new mexico to west texas, averaged 14 mbpd in 2006 compared to 16 mbpd in 2005. this decrease in net sales was due to natural field declines partially offset by development project results in the indian basin and drinkard areas of southeast new mexico. in the first half of 2006, we completed leasehold acquisitions totaling approximately 200,000 acres in the bakken shale oil play. the majority of the acreage is located in north dakota with the remainder in eastern montana. we now own a substantial position in the bakken shale with approximately 300 locations to be drilled over the next five years. our initial focus has been to evaluate our leasehold position. in july 2006, we completed a natural gas leasehold acquisition in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. the acreage is located near adjacent production. our plans include drilling approximately 700 wells over the next ten years with first production expected in late 2007. we continue to assess our acreage position in the barnett shale gas play in north central texas. to date, we have leased approximately 85,000 net acres in two counties. one core well and five horizontal wells have been drilled and completion activity is underway on these first wells. seismic data was acquired in 2006 and is being evaluated. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field are gas condensate fields. our share of sales from the brae area averaged 15 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2006, compared with 18 mbpd in 2005. this reduction primarily resulted from west brae field decline and the timing of sales of liquid hydrocarbons. our share of brae natural gas sales averaged 151 mmcfd, which was lower than the 169 mmcfd in 2005 as a result of natural field declines in the north and east brae gas condensate fields. 5 the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, there are 28 third-party fields contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ("sage") system. the sage pipeline transports gas from the brae and the third-party beryl areas and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ("bcf") per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the third-party britannia field. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own an approximate 30 percent interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent of east foinaven and 20 percent of the t35 and t25 accumulations. our share of sales from the foinaven fields averaged 17 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10 mmcfd of natural gas in 2006, compared to 16 mbpd and 9 mmcfd in 2005, primarily as a result of increased liquid handling capacity following facility modifications, increased well potential and improved operating efficiency. norway norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed above. we were approved for our first operatorship on the norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate seven licenses. during 2006, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in norway from the heimdal, vale and skirne fields averaged 2 mbpd and 36 mmcfd. we own a 24 percent outside-operated interest in the heimdal field, a 47 percent outside-operated interest in the vale field and a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the skirne field. we are the operator of the alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf. this development is comprised of the kameleon and kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent interest, and the boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent interest. during 2004, we received approval from the norwegian authorities for our alvheim plan for development and operation ("pdo"), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ("fpso") with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. the pdo also outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the sage system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. marathon and its alvheim project partners acquired the odin multipurpose shuttle tanker early in 2005. the vessel is currently being modified to serve as an fpso and has been renamed "alvheim." in 2004, the alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated interest, subject to the approval of the norwegian government. in 2005, the norwegian government approved the vilje pdo. progress also continues on the vilje project, where the subsea preparation is 98 percent complete and development drilling is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2007. first production from the alvheim/vilje development is expected during the second quarter of 2007. four wells will be available at first production and drilling activities will continue into 2008. a peak net rate of approximately 75,000 boepd is expected in early 2008. in 2006, we submitted a pdo for the volund field to the norwegian government, with a recommendation that the field be developed as a subsea tie-back to the alvheim fpso. in december 2006, the ministry of petroleum and energy forwarded the pdo to the norwegian king in council for approval. approval was received in early 2007. the volund development will include three producing wells and a water injection well. the crude oil production will be exported via the shuttle tankers discussed above and the associated natural gas will be exported via the alvheim-to-sage pipeline. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2009. ireland we own a 100 percent interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale fields in the celtic sea offshore ireland. in february 2006, we acquired an 87 percent operated interest in the seven heads natural gas field. previously, we processed and transported natural gas and we provided field operating services to the seven heads group through our existing kinsale head facilities. net natural gas sales in ireland were 46 mmcfd in 2006, compared with 50 mmcfd in 2005. in june 2006, we were awarded the first commercial natural gas storage license in ireland, which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the southwest kinsale field. in 2006, we began to produce and hold in storage natural gas from the kinsale head field for future delivery under a contract that expires in march 2009. additionally, natural gas produced from our other fields or purchased from other parties can be stored at southwest kinsale for future sale to customers. we own a 19 percent interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off ireland's northwest coast, where five of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. during 2004, 6 an bord plean&aacute;la (the planning board) upheld the mayo county council's decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at bellanaboy bridge, county mayo, which will process natural gas from the corrib field. development activities started in late 2004 but were suspended to facilitate dialogue and clarification of issues raised by opponents of the project. in july 2006, the partners in this project accepted the findings of a government-commissioned independent safety review and the report of an independent mediator regarding the onshore pipeline associated with the proposed development. the onshore pipeline will be re-routed and routing studies are underway. construction of the natural gas plant re-commenced in the third quarter of 2006. first production from the field is expected in 2009. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ("lpg") processing plant held through an equity method investee. during 2006, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 48 mbpd and net natural gas sales averaged 68 mmcfd, compared to 40 mbpd and 92 mmcfd in 2005. a condensate expansion project ramped up to full production and a new, larger lpg plant was completed in 2005. net sales in 2006 averaged 36 mbpd of condensate and 12 mbpd of lpg. we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ("ampco"), the results of which are included in the integrated gas segment. in 2006, we supplied a gross 99 mmcfd of dry gas, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, to ampco, where it was used to manufacture methanol. remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production when the lng production facility on bioko island, discussed below under integrated gas, is completed. libya net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 54 mbpd in 2006, of which a total of 8 mbpd were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations in libya. the 2006 sales in libya represented 37 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations. we continue to work with our partners to define and implement growth plans for this business. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent interest. net sales in gabon averaged 10 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2006, compared with 12 mbpd in 2005. production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at tchatamba marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. russia during 2003 we acquired khanty mansiysk oil corporation which operated oil fields located in the khanty mansiysk region of western siberia. net liquid hydrocarbon sales were primarily from the east kamennoye and potenay fields. in june 2006, we sold these russian oil exploration and production businesses. other matters we hold an interest in an exploration and production license in sudan. we suspended all operations in sudan in 1985 due to civil unrest. we have had no employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. the u.s. government imposed sanctions against sudan in 1997 and we have not made any payments related to sudan since then. we have abided and will continue to abide by all u.s. sanctions related to sudan and will not consider resuming any activity regarding our interests there until such time as it is permitted under u.s. law. our intention is to exit this license in 2007. we discovered the ash shaer and cherrife gas fields in syria in the 1980s. we have recognized no revenues in any period from activities in syria and we impaired our entire investment in syria in 1998. in july 2006, the new production sharing contract awarded by the syrian government was signed into law. this contract gave us the right to assign all or part of our interest in these fields to a third party, subject to the consent of the syrian government, and also resolved the previous disputes between us, the syrian petroleum company and the syrian government over our interest in these fields. in october 2006, the syrian government approved the assignment of 90 percent of our interest in the ash shaer and cherrife natural gas fields to a non-u.s. company. we closed the transaction on november 1, 2006, and received cash proceeds of $46 million. while we continue to hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest, we continue to comply with all u.s. sanctions related to syria. we expect to sell the remaining 10 percent interest in 2007. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing the gudrun field offshore norway and blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the timing of production from the neptune development, the piceance basin, the alvheim/vilje development, the volund field and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and 7 economic considerations. except for the alvheim/vilje and volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments on the gudrun field and blocks 31 and 32 could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. reserves at december 31, 2006, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1.262 billion boe, of which approximately 40 percent were located in organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd") countries. the following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years. estimated quantities of net

709 1,262 1,295 1,139 developed reserves as a percent of total net proved reserves 68 % 71 % 62 % (a) represents marathon's russian businesses, which were sold in 2006. proved developed reserves represented 68 percent of total proved reserves as of december 31, 2006, as compared to 71 percent as of december 31, 2005. of the 405 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2006, less than 10 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 11 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2006. during 2006, we added a total of 146 million boe of net proved reserves, principally in libya and equatorial guinea. we disposed of 45 million boe, while producing 134 million boe. of the total net proved reserve additions, 82 million boe were proved developed and 64 million boe were proved undeveloped reserves. during 2006, we transferred 18 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves, were $1.010 billion, $955 million and $708 million. as of december 31, 2006, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2007 through 2009 are projected to be $466 million, $348 million and $231 million. 8 our libyan fields had the most significant positive changes, totaling 69 million boe. this included positive revisions due to access to additional data and our improved understanding of reservoir performance during the first year after our re-entry and additions for future development drilling. at the end of 2006, our proved reserves associated with libya totaled 214 million boe, or 17 percent of our total proved reserves. additionally, 21 million boe were added to our proved reserves for the alba field in equatorial guinea, primarily as a result of expanded natural gas marketing and supply agreements. the above estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved reserve estimation process, see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves on pages f-46 through f-47. we filed reports with the u.s. department of energy ("doe") for the years 2005 and 2004 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and natural gas reserves. we will file a similar report for 2006. the year-end estimates reported to the doe are the same as the estimates reported in the supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements. in alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with local utility companies, which obligate us to supply 124 bcf of natural gas over the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2018. in addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska lng plant and a proportionate share of the long-term lng sales obligation to two japanese utility companies. this obligation is estimated to total 43 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates in 2009. these commitments are structured with variable-pricing terms. our production from various natural gas fields in the cook inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. our proved reserves in the cook inlet are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. in the u.k., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply 125 bcf of natural gas through the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2009. our brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. pricing under these natural gas sales contracts is variable. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contracts. 9 oil and natural gas net sales the following tables set forth the daily average net sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas for each of the last three years. net liquid hydrocarbon sales (a) (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 united states

refining, marketing and transportation our rm&amp;t operations are primarily conducted by mpc and its subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries speedway superamerica llc ("ssa") and marathon pipe line llc. refining we own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 974 mbpd of crude oil. during 2006, our refineries processed 980 mbpd of crude oil and 234 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks for a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 101 percent. the table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our refineries as of december 31, 2006. crude oil refining capacity (thousand barrels per day) garyville, louisiana 245 catlettsburg, kentucky 222 robinson, illinois 192 detroit, michigan 100 canton, ohio 73 texas city, texas 72 st. paul park, minnesota 70 total 974 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low sulfur gasolines and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. we also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. we manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax. our refineries are integrated via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. we completed a major turnaround at our catlettsburg refinery in 2006. the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years. refined product yields (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 gasoline 661 644 608 distillates 323 318 299 propane 23 21 22 feedstocks and

protection agency prior to its june 1, 2006 deadline. these modifications were completed on time and under budget. 13 in 2006, our board of directors approved a projected $3.2 billion expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery by 180 mbpd to 425 mbpd, which will increase our total refining capacity to 1.154 million barrels per day ("mmbpd"). we recently received air permit approval from the louisiana department of environmental quality for this project and construction is expected to begin in mid-2007, with startup planned for the fourth quarter of 2009. we have also commenced front-end engineering and design ("feed") for a potential heavy oil upgrading project at our detroit refinery, which would allow us to process increased volumes of canadian oil sands production, and are undertaking a feasibility study for a similar upgrading project at our catlettsburg refinery. marketing we are a supplier of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our market area in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states. in 2006, our refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 21.5 billion gallons, or 1.401 mmbpd. the average sales price of our refined products in aggregate was $77.76 per barrel for 2006. the following table sets forth our refined product sales by product group and our average sales price for each of the last three years. refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 gasoline 804 836 807 distillates 375 385 373 propane 23 22 22 feedstocks and special

mbpd and 71 mbpd in 2006, 2005 and 2004. on april 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. this change resulted in lower refined product sales volumes for the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under the previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers and sales in the spot market accounted for 71 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. we sold 52 percent of our gasoline volumes and 89 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis. half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the united states and canada, with pitch products also being exported worldwide. we market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states. our customer base includes approximately 800 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. we blended 35 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2006. in 2005 and 2004, we blended 35 mbpd and 30 mbpd of ethanol. the expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and changes in government regulations. we sell reformulated gasoline in parts of our marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin, and we sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. as of december 31, 2006, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,200 marathon branded retail outlets located primarily in ohio, michigan, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in florida, georgia, minnesota, wisconsin, west virginia, tennessee, virginia, north carolina, pennsylvania, alabama and south carolina. sales to marathon brand jobbers and dealers accounted for 14 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. ssa sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated retail outlets. sales of refined products through these ssa retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. as of december 31, 2006, ssa had 1,636 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names "speedway" and "superamerica." ssa's revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.7 billion in 2006, compared with $2.5 billion in 2005. profit levels from the sale 14 of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. ssa also operates 60 valvoline instant oil change retail outlets located in michigan and northwest ohio. pilot travel centers llc ("ptc"), our joint venture with pilot corporation ("pilot"), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with 269 locations in 37 states and canada at december 31, 2006. in 2006, ptc expanded internationally with the opening of a site in ontario, canada. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand-name restaurants at many locations. pilot and marathon each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. our retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa's midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. supply and transportation we obtain most of the crude oil we refine from negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. in 2006, u.s. sourced crude oil averaged 470 mbpd, or 48 percent of the crude oil processed at our refineries, including a net 14 mbpd from our production operations. in 2006, canada was the source for 13 percent, or 130 mbpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 39 percent, or 380 mbpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including 198 mbpd from the middle east. this crude oil was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. the following table provides information on the sources of crude for each of the last three years. sources of crude oil refined (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 united states 470 447 416 canada 130 111 130 middle east and africa 266 301 276 other international 114 114 117 total 980 973 939 average cost of crude oil throughput ($ per barrel) $ 61.15 $ 51.85 $ 39.16 we operate a system of pipelines, terminals and barges to provide crude oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing areas. at december 31, 2006, we owned, leased, operated or held equity method investments in 68 miles of crude oil gathering lines, 3,718 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,855 miles of refined product trunk lines. excluding equity method investees, our owned or operated common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following

total 950 1,043 983 at december 31, 2006 we had interests in the following pipelines: 100 percent ownership of ohio river pipe line llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio, known as cardinal products pipeline; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana to north muskegon, michigan; 51 percent interest in loop llc ("loop"), the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at clovelly, louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 15 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting gulf coast refineries with the midwest market; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois; 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest; 17 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our st. paul park, minnesota refinery; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois to toledo, ohio. our 87 owned and operated light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeast. these facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and trucks. our marine transportation operations include towboats (15 owned) and barges (180 owned, 4 leased) that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. we lease and own over 2,000 rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and over 100 tractors and tank trailers. ethanol production in 2006, we signed a definitive agreement forming a 50/50 joint venture that will construct and operate one or more ethanol production plants. our partner in the joint venture will provide the day-to-day management of the plants, as well as grain procurement, distillers dried grain marketing and ethanol management services. this venture will enable us to maintain the reliability of a portion of our future ethanol supplies. together with our partner, we selected the venture's initial plant site, greenville, ohio, and construction has commenced on a 110 million gallon per year ethanol facility. the facility is expected to be operational as soon as the first quarter of 2008. the above discussion of the rm&amp;t segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the planned expansion of the garyville refinery, potential heavy oil refining upgrading projects and a joint venture that would construct and operate ethanol plants. some factors that could affect the garyville expansion project and the ethanol plant construction, management and development include necessary government and third party approvals, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the garyville project may be further affected by crude oil supply. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. factors that could affect the heavy oil refining upgrading projects include unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements, results of front-end engineering and design work, approval of our board of directors, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, continued favorable investment climate, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. other the energy policy act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard ("rfs") providing that all gasoline sold in the united states contain a minimum of 4.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006. the rfs increases gradually each year until 2012, when the rfs will be 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel. the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") has published a proposed rule to implement the rfs, and we anticipate that a final rule will be published in mid-2007. federal legislation may be proposed in 2007 which may require even greater quantities of renewable fuels. marathon intends to comply with all regulations that are adopted. integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations, methanol operations, and certain other gas processing facilities. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. 16 alaska lng we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, the lng has been sold under a long-term contract with two of japan's largest utility companies. this contract continues through march 2009, with 2006 lng deliveries totaling 61 gross bcf (19 net bcf). in january 2007, along with our partner, we filed a request with the u.s. department of energy to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through march 2011. equatorial guinea lng in 2004, we and our partner, compania nacional de petroleos de guinea ecuatorial (the national oil company of equatorial guinea or "gepetrol"), through equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ("egholdings"), began construction of a 3.7 million metric ton per annum ("mmtpa") lng production facility on bioko island. we expect to begin delivering 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, during the second quarter of 2007 under a 17-year sales and purchase agreement. the purchaser under this agreement will take delivery of the lng facility's production on an fob bioko island basis with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this project will allow us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the production facility will be purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. we are currently seeking additional natural gas supplies to allow full utilization of this lng facility, which is designed to have a higher capacity and a longer life than the current 17-year sales and purchase agreement. in july 2005, marathon and gepetrol entered into agreements under which mitsui &amp; co., ltd. ("mitsui") and a subsidiary of marubeni corporation ("marubeni") acquired 8.5 percent and 6.5 percent interests in egholdings. in november 2006, gepetrol transferred its 25 percent interest to sociedad nacional de gas de guinea ecuatorial ("sonagas"), which is also controlled by the government of equatorial guinea. following these transaction, we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, with sonagas holding a 25 percent interest and mitsui and marubeni holding the remaining interests. in 2006, with our project partners, we awarded a feed contract for initial work related to a potential second lng production facility on bioko island, equatorial guinea. the feed work is expected to be completed during 2007. the scope of the feed work for the potential 4.4 mmtpa lng project includes feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil off gas compression, product transfer to storage and lng product metering. a final investment decision is expected in early 2008. elba island lng in april 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes at the elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal pursuant to an lng sales and purchase agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as lng) per year, through march 31, 2021 with a possible extension to november 30, 2023. in september 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years. the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. methanol we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production in the alba field. methanol sales totaled 733,680 gross metric tons (330,156 net metric tons) in 2006. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the united states. gas technology we invest in natural gas technology research, including gas-to-liquids ("gtl") technology which offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels. in addition to gtl, we continue to evaluate application of gas technologies accessible through licenses, including methanol-to-power and compressed natural gas. we also continue to develop a 17 proprietary gas-to-fuels ("gtf") technology, which can be configured to convert natural gas resources into premium fuels. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of production associated with the lng production facility and the possible expansion thereof. factors that could affect the lng production facility include unforeseen problems arising from commissioning of the facilities, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other operating considerations such as shipping the lng. in addition to these factors, other factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the current lng production facility and the development of additional lng capacity through additional projects include partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, we currently rank ninth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2006. we compete in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products. we believe we compete with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 70 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; nine refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 260 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa's retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway . we also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in ptc. our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. 18 financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of marathon's principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by marathon: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel's fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for marathon's discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee marathon provided with respect to all of united states steel's obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel's obligations to marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel's accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. tax sharing agreement marathon and united states steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. during 2006, the internal revenue service completed its review of all federal income tax returns filed by usx corporation for taxable periods ending on or prior to the date of the separation. marathon and united states steel have settled all matters related to federal income taxes under this agreement. remaining matters related to state and local income taxes are not expected to have any significant effect on marathon. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2006 see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel" for a discussion of our obligations associated with the separation. 19 environmental matters the corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues identified by management, including environmental matters. our corporate responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving marathon or any of our properties. legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. the kyoto protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. other climate change legislation and regulations both in the united states and abroad are in various stages of development. although there may be financial impact (including compliance costs) associated with any legislation or regulation, the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty of these measures. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ("caa") with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ("cwa") with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ("opa-90") with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies" and "legal proceedings." air of particular significance to our refining operations were u.s. epa regulations that required reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. we achieved compliance with these regulations and began production of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for on-road use prior to the june 1, 2006 deadline. the cost of achieving compliance with these regulations was approximately $850 million. marathon will also be spending approximately $250 million from 2006 through 2010 to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use. further, marathon estimates that it will spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with mobile source air toxics ii regulations relating to benzene. this is a preliminary estimate as the mobile source air toxics ii regulations should be finalized in the first half of 2007. the epa has finalized new and revised national ambient air quality standards ("naaqs") for fine particulate emissions and ozone. in connection with these new standards, the epa will designate certain areas as "nonattainment," meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, in january 2004, the epa proposed a rule called the interstate air quality rule ("iaqr") that would require significant reductions of so2 and nox emissions in numerous states. the final rule was promulgated on may 12, 2005, and the rule was renamed the clean air interstate rule ("cair"). while the epa expects that states will meet their cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units ("egus"), states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. our refinery operations are located in affected states and some states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair 20 requirements; however we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the states have taken further action. water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ("usts") containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm&amp;t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. ongoing rcra-related costs are not expected to be material. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. see legal proceedings environmental proceedings other proceedings for a discussion of these sites. employees we had 28,195 active employees as of december 31, 2006. of that number, 19,132 were employees of ssa, most of whom were employed at our retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2009. the same union represents certain hourly employees at our texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2009. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2009 at our st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2010 at our detroit refinery. available information general

marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. the following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices, as well as refined product gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for oil and natural gas and refined product gross margins fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and refined products. historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of oil, natural gas and refined products are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil, natural gas and refined products; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climatic changes; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of oil and natural gas, as well as on refined product gross margins, are uncertain. lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as lower refined product gross margins, may reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in oil and natural gas prices or refined product gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures and impair the carrying value of our assets. estimates of oil and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our oil and natural gas reserves. the proved oil and natural gas reserves information related to marathon included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group and/or third-party consultants we have retained. the estimates were calculated using oil and natural gas prices in effect as of december 31, 2006, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and 22 assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of oil and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future oil and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and natural gas is produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the oil and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; and the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs. increases in crude oil prices and environmental regulations may reduce our refined product gross margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall rm&amp;t profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refined product gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. in addition, environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our refining, marketing and transportation operations, which may reduce our refined product gross margins. if we do not compete successfully with our competitors, our future operating performance and profitability could materially decline. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. in addition, in implementing our integrated gas strategy, we compete with major integrated energy companies in 23 bidding for and developing liquefied natural gas projects, which are very capital intensive. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional properties and bidding for and developing additional projects, such as lng production facilities. many of our larger competitors in the lng market can complete more projects than we have the capacity to complete, which could lead those competitors to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. in addition, many of our larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas, such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. approximately 56 percent of our oil and natural gas production in 2006 was derived from production outside the united states and approximately 72 percent of our proved reserves as of december 31, 2006, were located outside the united states. there are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of the u.s. government through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the 24 past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. actions by both the united states and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and, therefore, we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather and labor disputes. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. these hazards could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling and production and could materially reduce our profitability. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities. due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. if ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland. as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland in 2005, marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to ashland's interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions. however, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service. if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland. in that event, our indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland. marathon is required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland, which could be material. we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions. under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two "baskets," as described below: basket one this applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland. the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one. upon specified events related to ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would 25 otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two. in addition, basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two. because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland's pre-transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two. the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a "with and without" basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group. thus, if the marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland. because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group's tax liability for a particular year. this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation, ashland is required to repay such compensation to marathon. in the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc that was previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of the interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland. under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than "reasonably equivalent value" or, in some jurisdictions, less than "fair consideration" or "valuable consideration;" and the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. in connection with our transactions with ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland's shareholders. in order to help establish that ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland's interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired. we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland's representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to ashland's existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) ashland's receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) ashland's solvency, it should be noted that the 26 valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon, united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $564 million as of december 31, 2006, including accrued interest of $11 million. if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel. in that event, our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel. under applicable law and regulations, we also may be liable for any defaults by united states steel in the performance of its obligations to fund its erisa pension plans and pay other obligations related to periods prior to the effective date of the separation. united states steel's senior unsecured debt is rated non-investment grade by two major credit rating agencies. the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors' rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. if the transfer of ownership of various assets and operations by marathon's former parent entity to marathon was held to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, united states steel's creditors may be able to obtain recovery from us or other relief detrimental to the holders of our common stock. in july 2001, usx corporation ("old usx") effected a reorganization of the ownership of its businesses in which it created marathon as its publicly owned parent holding company and transferred ownership of various assets and operations to marathon, and it merged into a newly formed subsidiary which survived as united states steel. if a court in a bankruptcy case regarding united states steel or a lawsuit brought by its creditors or their representative were to find that, under the applicable fraudulent conveyance or transfer law: the transfer by old usx to marathon or related transactions were undertaken by old usx with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its existing or future creditors; or old usx received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration, or no value or consideration, in connection with those transactions, and either it or united states steel was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of those transactions, was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature, then that court could determine those transactions entitled one or more classes of creditors of united states steel to equitable relief from us. such a determination could permit the unpaid creditors to obtain recovery from us or could result in other actions detrimental to the holders of our common stock. the measure of insolvency for purposes of these considerations would vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "plan," "predict" "target," "project," "could," "may," "should," "would" or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the "separation"), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ("steel stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ("united states steel") to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and since that date, marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ("map") previously held by ashland inc. ("ashland"). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland's valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions (the "acquisition"), map is now wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ("mpc") effective september 1, 2005. segment and geographic information our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) exploration and production ("e&amp;p") explores for, produces and markets crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) refining, marketing and transportation ("rm&amp;t") refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states; and 3) integrated gas ("ig") markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ("lng") and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 2 exploration and production (in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to "net" wells, production or sales indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.) we conduct exploration, development and production activities in ten countries, with a focus on international growth while continuing to maintain our position in the united states. principal exploration activities were in the united states, norway, angola and indonesia. principal development and production activities were in the united states, the united kingdom, norway, equatorial guinea and libya. our 2006 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations averaged 223 thousand barrels per day ("mbpd"), an increase of 36 percent from 2005 levels. our 2006 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 847 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd"), a decrease of 9 percent compared to 2005. in total, our 2006 worldwide net sales from continuing operations averaged 365 thousand barrels of oil equivalent ("mboe") per day, compared to 319 mboe per day in 2005. (for purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ("mcf") by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.) in 2007, our worldwide net production available for sale is expected to average 390 to 425 mboe per day, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions. the above projections of 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production available for sale volumes are forward-looking statements. some factors that could potentially affect levels of production available for sale include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability to or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. exploration in the united states during 2006, we drilled 33 gross (16 net) exploratory wells of which 21 gross (10 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 21 wells, 6 gross (4 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of completing at year end. internationally, we drilled 21 gross (4 net) exploratory wells of which 16 gross (3 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 16 wells, 9 gross (3 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2006. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for us. at the end of 2006, we had interests in 129 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 100 in the deepwater area. during 2006, we increased our interest from 20 percent to 30 percent in the stones prospect (walker ridge block 508). an appraisal well is planned for 2007 on this outside-operated 2005 discovery. in 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the ozona prospect (garden banks block 515) in the gulf of mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was successful. we are continuing to evaluate options to develop the ozona prospect. commercial terms have been secured for the tie-back and processing of ozona production and we have been actively searching for a rig to drill the development well. we hold a 68 percent operated interest in the ozona prospect. a well on the flathead prospect (walker ridge block 30) in the gulf of mexico was suspended in 2002. technical evaluations are complete and commercial evaluations continued in 2006. the drilling of this prospect is delayed due to the shortage of available deepwater rigs. we continue to pursue partnering opportunities with other oil and gas companies that have deepwater rigs under contract. we hold a 100 percent operated interest in the flathead prospect. norway we hold interests in over 700,000 gross acres offshore norway and plan to continue our exploration effort there. in 2006, we participated in a successful appraisal well on the gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast. marathon holds a 28 percent outside-operated interest in gudrun where we are primarily focused on evaluating development scenarios. angola offshore angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in block 32. through february 2007, we have announced 20 discoveries on these blocks. we have 3 also participated in four wells that have reached total depth, the results of which will be announced upon government and partner approvals. we expect to participate in 10 or 11 wells on these blocks in 2007. on block 31, four previously announced discoveries (plutao, saturno, marte and venus) and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of the block. also on block 31, we had five previously announced discoveries located in the southeastern portion of the block (palas, ceres, juno, astraea and hebe). in 2006 and early 2007, we announced discoveries at urano, titania, terra and an unnamed well. we are integrating the results of these wells with our previously announced discoveries. on block 32, we previously announced three discoveries (gindungo, canela and gengibre). in 2006, we announced the fourth discovery on block 32, the mostarda-1, and a successful deepwater delineation well, gengibre-2. we also announced that hydrocarbons were encountered in the salsa well, but additional drilling is required to assess its commerciality. in early 2007, we announced two additional discoveries, the manjericao and caril wells. these discoveries move block 32 closer toward establishment of a commercial development. equatorial guinea during 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the alba block offshore equatorial guinea. the deep luba discovery well, drilled from the alba field production platform, encountered natural gas and condensate in several pay zones. the gardenia discovery well is located 11 miles southwest of the alba field. we are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the deep luba and gardenia discoveries. we hold a 63 percent operated interest in the alba block. in 2004, we announced the results of the corona well drilled on block d offshore equatorial guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent working interest. the corona well confirmed an extension of the alba field on to block d. an application for an area of commercial discovery was submitted prior to the end of the production sharing contract's exploration period, which expired at the end of 2006. we are currently in discussions with the equatorial guinea government regarding our rights to develop the block d extension of the alba field. libya we hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2006 included the drilling of 12 wells, nine of which were successful. most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations. canada we are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the annapolis lease offshore nova scotia, where we continue to evaluate further drilling. in late 2006, we decided to withdraw from the adjacent cortland lease, where we hold a 75 percent interest, and the adjacent empire lease, where we hold a 50 percent interest. as a result of this withdrawal, a charge equal to 25 percent of the remaining work commitment, or $47 million, was recorded as exploration expense in 2006 and the cash payment will be due to the canadian provincial government in 2007. indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin oil and natural gas production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006. we expect to begin collecting geophysical data in 2007, followed by exploratory drilling in 2008 and 2009. production (including development activities) united states our u.s. operation accounted for 34 percent of our 2006 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations and 63 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. during 2006, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 35 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 46 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 43 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 8 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon sales in the gulf of mexico increased slightly from the prior year, mainly due to the effects of five tropical storms/hurricanes in 2005. net natural gas sales decreased by 41 mmcfd from the prior year primarily because natural gas sales from the camden hills field ended in early 2006 as a result of increased water production. at year-end 2006, we held interests in seven producing fields and eight platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which four platforms are operated by marathon. the majority of our sales in the gulf of mexico comes from the petronius development in viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. we own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in these blocks. the platform provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. for example, petronius processes the production from our perseus field which commenced production in april 2005 and is located five miles from the platform. 4 we hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest in the neptune deepwater development on atwater valley blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the gulf of mexico, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the initial development plan for neptune was sanctioned in 2005 and includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone mini-tension leg platform. construction of the platform and facility continued through 2006 with first production expected in early 2008. we are one of the largest natural gas producers in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2006, our alaskan net natural gas sales averaged 156 mmcfd, representing 29 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. in may 2006, upon receipt of regulatory approvals, we began to produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. the natural gas in storage will be used to manage supplies to meet contractual demand. in addition to our operations in other established alaskan fields, production from the ninilchik field began in 2003 and development continues on the field. ninilchik natural gas is transported through the 35-mile portion of the kenai kachemak pipeline which connects ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the kenai peninsula, in anchorage and in other parts of south central alaska. we operate ninilchik and own a 60 percent interest in it and the section of the kenai kachemak pipeline described above. our 2006 development program in the cook inlet included participation in the drilling of seven wells. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from our wyoming fields averaged 21 mbpd in 2006 and 2005. net natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 119 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 107 mmcfd in 2005. the increase in our wyoming net natural gas sales is primarily attributed to higher net sales from the powder river basin, which averaged 77 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 66 mmcfd in 2005 as a result of 2005 drilling activity. development of the powder river basin continued in 2006 with 119 wells drilled, which was down from the 195 wells drilled in 2005 due to project delays primarily caused by regulatory and produced water management issues. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2006 where we participated in the drilling of 27 wells. net natural gas sales from our oklahoma fields averaged 87 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 77 mmcfd in 2005 primarily as a result of development and exploratory drilling. our 2006 development program continued to focus in the anadarko basin where we participated in the drilling of 75 wells. net natural gas sales from our east texas and north louisiana fields averaged 71 mmcfd in 2006 compared to 75 mmcfd in 2005. this decrease is primarily attributable to sour gas handling capacity limits at the natural gas plants that purchase our east texas natural gas, partially offset by development drilling results. active development of the mimms creek field in east texas continued in 2006. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the permian basin region, which extends from southeast new mexico to west texas, averaged 14 mbpd in 2006 compared to 16 mbpd in 2005. this decrease in net sales was due to natural field declines partially offset by development project results in the indian basin and drinkard areas of southeast new mexico. in the first half of 2006, we completed leasehold acquisitions totaling approximately 200,000 acres in the bakken shale oil play. the majority of the acreage is located in north dakota with the remainder in eastern montana. we now own a substantial position in the bakken shale with approximately 300 locations to be drilled over the next five years. our initial focus has been to evaluate our leasehold position. in july 2006, we completed a natural gas leasehold acquisition in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. the acreage is located near adjacent production. our plans include drilling approximately 700 wells over the next ten years with first production expected in late 2007. we continue to assess our acreage position in the barnett shale gas play in north central texas. to date, we have leased approximately 85,000 net acres in two counties. one core well and five horizontal wells have been drilled and completion activity is underway on these first wells. seismic data was acquired in 2006 and is being evaluated. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field are gas condensate fields. our share of sales from the brae area averaged 15 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2006, compared with 18 mbpd in 2005. this reduction primarily resulted from west brae field decline and the timing of sales of liquid hydrocarbons. our share of brae natural gas sales averaged 151 mmcfd, which was lower than the 169 mmcfd in 2005 as a result of natural field declines in the north and east brae gas condensate fields. 5 the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, there are 28 third-party fields contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ("sage") system. the sage pipeline transports gas from the brae and the third-party beryl areas and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ("bcf") per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the third-party britannia field. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own an approximate 30 percent interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent of east foinaven and 20 percent of the t35 and t25 accumulations. our share of sales from the foinaven fields averaged 17 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10 mmcfd of natural gas in 2006, compared to 16 mbpd and 9 mmcfd in 2005, primarily as a result of increased liquid handling capacity following facility modifications, increased well potential and improved operating efficiency. norway norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed above. we were approved for our first operatorship on the norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate seven licenses. during 2006, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in norway from the heimdal, vale and skirne fields averaged 2 mbpd and 36 mmcfd. we own a 24 percent outside-operated interest in the heimdal field, a 47 percent outside-operated interest in the vale field and a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the skirne field. we are the operator of the alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf. this development is comprised of the kameleon and kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent interest, and the boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent interest. during 2004, we received approval from the norwegian authorities for our alvheim plan for development and operation ("pdo"), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ("fpso") with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. the pdo also outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the sage system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. marathon and its alvheim project partners acquired the odin multipurpose shuttle tanker early in 2005. the vessel is currently being modified to serve as an fpso and has been renamed "alvheim." in 2004, the alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated interest, subject to the approval of the norwegian government. in 2005, the norwegian government approved the vilje pdo. progress also continues on the vilje project, where the subsea preparation is 98 percent complete and development drilling is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2007. first production from the alvheim/vilje development is expected during the second quarter of 2007. four wells will be available at first production and drilling activities will continue into 2008. a peak net rate of approximately 75,000 boepd is expected in early 2008. in 2006, we submitted a pdo for the volund field to the norwegian government, with a recommendation that the field be developed as a subsea tie-back to the alvheim fpso. in december 2006, the ministry of petroleum and energy forwarded the pdo to the norwegian king in council for approval. approval was received in early 2007. the volund development will include three producing wells and a water injection well. the crude oil production will be exported via the shuttle tankers discussed above and the associated natural gas will be exported via the alvheim-to-sage pipeline. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2009. ireland we own a 100 percent interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale fields in the celtic sea offshore ireland. in february 2006, we acquired an 87 percent operated interest in the seven heads natural gas field. previously, we processed and transported natural gas and we provided field operating services to the seven heads group through our existing kinsale head facilities. net natural gas sales in ireland were 46 mmcfd in 2006, compared with 50 mmcfd in 2005. in june 2006, we were awarded the first commercial natural gas storage license in ireland, which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the southwest kinsale field. in 2006, we began to produce and hold in storage natural gas from the kinsale head field for future delivery under a contract that expires in march 2009. additionally, natural gas produced from our other fields or purchased from other parties can be stored at southwest kinsale for future sale to customers. we own a 19 percent interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off ireland's northwest coast, where five of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. during 2004, 6 an bord plean&aacute;la (the planning board) upheld the mayo county council's decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at bellanaboy bridge, county mayo, which will process natural gas from the corrib field. development activities started in late 2004 but were suspended to facilitate dialogue and clarification of issues raised by opponents of the project. in july 2006, the partners in this project accepted the findings of a government-commissioned independent safety review and the report of an independent mediator regarding the onshore pipeline associated with the proposed development. the onshore pipeline will be re-routed and routing studies are underway. construction of the natural gas plant re-commenced in the third quarter of 2006. first production from the field is expected in 2009. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ("lpg") processing plant held through an equity method investee. during 2006, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 48 mbpd and net natural gas sales averaged 68 mmcfd, compared to 40 mbpd and 92 mmcfd in 2005. a condensate expansion project ramped up to full production and a new, larger lpg plant was completed in 2005. net sales in 2006 averaged 36 mbpd of condensate and 12 mbpd of lpg. we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ("ampco"), the results of which are included in the integrated gas segment. in 2006, we supplied a gross 99 mmcfd of dry gas, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, to ampco, where it was used to manufacture methanol. remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production when the lng production facility on bioko island, discussed below under integrated gas, is completed. libya net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 54 mbpd in 2006, of which a total of 8 mbpd were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations in libya. the 2006 sales in libya represented 37 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales from continuing operations. we continue to work with our partners to define and implement growth plans for this business. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent interest. net sales in gabon averaged 10 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2006, compared with 12 mbpd in 2005. production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at tchatamba marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. russia during 2003 we acquired khanty mansiysk oil corporation which operated oil fields located in the khanty mansiysk region of western siberia. net liquid hydrocarbon sales were primarily from the east kamennoye and potenay fields. in june 2006, we sold these russian oil exploration and production businesses. other matters we hold an interest in an exploration and production license in sudan. we suspended all operations in sudan in 1985 due to civil unrest. we have had no employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. the u.s. government imposed sanctions against sudan in 1997 and we have not made any payments related to sudan since then. we have abided and will continue to abide by all u.s. sanctions related to sudan and will not consider resuming any activity regarding our interests there until such time as it is permitted under u.s. law. our intention is to exit this license in 2007. we discovered the ash shaer and cherrife gas fields in syria in the 1980s. we have recognized no revenues in any period from activities in syria and we impaired our entire investment in syria in 1998. in july 2006, the new production sharing contract awarded by the syrian government was signed into law. this contract gave us the right to assign all or part of our interest in these fields to a third party, subject to the consent of the syrian government, and also resolved the previous disputes between us, the syrian petroleum company and the syrian government over our interest in these fields. in october 2006, the syrian government approved the assignment of 90 percent of our interest in the ash shaer and cherrife natural gas fields to a non-u.s. company. we closed the transaction on november 1, 2006, and received cash proceeds of $46 million. while we continue to hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest, we continue to comply with all u.s. sanctions related to syria. we expect to sell the remaining 10 percent interest in 2007. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing the gudrun field offshore norway and blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the timing of production from the neptune development, the piceance basin, the alvheim/vilje development, the volund field and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and 7 economic considerations. except for the alvheim/vilje and volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments on the gudrun field and blocks 31 and 32 could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. reserves at december 31, 2006, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1.262 billion boe, of which approximately 40 percent were located in organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd") countries. the following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years. estimated quantities of net

709 1,262 1,295 1,139 developed reserves as a percent of total net proved reserves 68 % 71 % 62 % (a) represents marathon's russian businesses, which were sold in 2006. proved developed reserves represented 68 percent of total proved reserves as of december 31, 2006, as compared to 71 percent as of december 31, 2005. of the 405 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2006, less than 10 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 11 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2006. during 2006, we added a total of 146 million boe of net proved reserves, principally in libya and equatorial guinea. we disposed of 45 million boe, while producing 134 million boe. of the total net proved reserve additions, 82 million boe were proved developed and 64 million boe were proved undeveloped reserves. during 2006, we transferred 18 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves, were $1.010 billion, $955 million and $708 million. as of december 31, 2006, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2007 through 2009 are projected to be $466 million, $348 million and $231 million. 8 our libyan fields had the most significant positive changes, totaling 69 million boe. this included positive revisions due to access to additional data and our improved understanding of reservoir performance during the first year after our re-entry and additions for future development drilling. at the end of 2006, our proved reserves associated with libya totaled 214 million boe, or 17 percent of our total proved reserves. additionally, 21 million boe were added to our proved reserves for the alba field in equatorial guinea, primarily as a result of expanded natural gas marketing and supply agreements. the above estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved reserve estimation process, see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves on pages f-46 through f-47. we filed reports with the u.s. department of energy ("doe") for the years 2005 and 2004 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and natural gas reserves. we will file a similar report for 2006. the year-end estimates reported to the doe are the same as the estimates reported in the supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. delivery commitments we have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements. in alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with local utility companies, which obligate us to supply 124 bcf of natural gas over the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2018. in addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska lng plant and a proportionate share of the long-term lng sales obligation to two japanese utility companies. this obligation is estimated to total 43 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates in 2009. these commitments are structured with variable-pricing terms. our production from various natural gas fields in the cook inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. our proved reserves in the cook inlet are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. in the u.k., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply 125 bcf of natural gas through the remaining lives of these contracts, which terminate in 2009. our brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates are sufficient to meet these contractual obligations. pricing under these natural gas sales contracts is variable. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contracts. 9 oil and natural gas net sales the following tables set forth the daily average net sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas for each of the last three years. net liquid hydrocarbon sales (a) (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 united states

refining, marketing and transportation our rm&amp;t operations are primarily conducted by mpc and its subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries speedway superamerica llc ("ssa") and marathon pipe line llc. refining we own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 974 mbpd of crude oil. during 2006, our refineries processed 980 mbpd of crude oil and 234 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks for a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 101 percent. the table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our refineries as of december 31, 2006. crude oil refining capacity (thousand barrels per day) garyville, louisiana 245 catlettsburg, kentucky 222 robinson, illinois 192 detroit, michigan 100 canton, ohio 73 texas city, texas 72 st. paul park, minnesota 70 total 974 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low sulfur gasolines and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. we also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. we manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax. our refineries are integrated via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. we completed a major turnaround at our catlettsburg refinery in 2006. the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years. refined product yields (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 gasoline 661 644 608 distillates 323 318 299 propane 23 21 22 feedstocks and special products 107 96 94 heavy fuel oil 26 28 25 asphalt 89 85 77 total 1,229 1,192 1,125 we completed all of our ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel modifications required by the u.s. environmental protection agency prior to its june 1, 2006 deadline. these modifications were completed on time and under budget. 13 in 2006, our board of directors approved a projected $3.2 billion expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery by 180 mbpd to 425 mbpd, which will increase our total refining capacity to 1.154 million barrels per day ("mmbpd"). we recently received air permit approval from the louisiana department of environmental quality for this project and construction is expected to begin in mid-2007, with startup planned for the fourth quarter of 2009. we have also commenced front-end engineering and design ("feed") for a potential heavy oil upgrading project at our detroit refinery, which would allow us to process increased volumes of canadian oil sands production, and are undertaking a feasibility study for a similar upgrading project at our catlettsburg refinery. marketing we are a supplier of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our market area in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states. in 2006, our refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 21.5 billion gallons, or 1.401 mmbpd. the average sales price of our refined products in aggregate was $77.76 per barrel for 2006. the following table sets forth our refined product sales by product group and our average sales price for each of the last three years. refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 gasoline 804 836 807 distillates 375 385 373 propane 23 22 22 feedstocks and special

mbpd and 71 mbpd in 2006, 2005 and 2004. on april 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. this change resulted in lower refined product sales volumes for the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under the previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers and sales in the spot market accounted for 71 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. we sold 52 percent of our gasoline volumes and 89 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis. half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the united states and canada, with pitch products also being exported worldwide. we market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states. our customer base includes approximately 800 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. we blended 35 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2006. in 2005 and 2004, we blended 35 mbpd and 30 mbpd of ethanol. the expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and changes in government regulations. we sell reformulated gasoline in parts of our marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin, and we sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. as of december 31, 2006, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,200 marathon branded retail outlets located primarily in ohio, michigan, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in florida, georgia, minnesota, wisconsin, west virginia, tennessee, virginia, north carolina, pennsylvania, alabama and south carolina. sales to marathon brand jobbers and dealers accounted for 14 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. ssa sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated retail outlets. sales of refined products through these ssa retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2006. as of december 31, 2006, ssa had 1,636 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names "speedway" and "superamerica." ssa's revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.7 billion in 2006, compared with $2.5 billion in 2005. profit levels from the sale 14 of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. ssa also operates 60 valvoline instant oil change retail outlets located in michigan and northwest ohio. pilot travel centers llc ("ptc"), our joint venture with pilot corporation ("pilot"), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with 269 locations in 37 states and canada at december 31, 2006. in 2006, ptc expanded internationally with the opening of a site in ontario, canada. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand-name restaurants at many locations. pilot and marathon each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. our retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa's midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. supply and transportation we obtain most of the crude oil we refine from negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. in 2006, u.s. sourced crude oil averaged 470 mbpd, or 48 percent of the crude oil processed at our refineries, including a net 14 mbpd from our production operations. in 2006, canada was the source for 13 percent, or 130 mbpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 39 percent, or 380 mbpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including 198 mbpd from the middle east. this crude oil was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. the following table provides information on the sources of crude for each of the last three years. sources of crude oil refined (thousands of barrels per day) 2006 2005 2004 united states 470 447 416 canada 130 111 130 middle east and africa 266 301 276 other international 114 114 117 total 980 973 939 average cost of crude oil throughput ($ per barrel) $ 61.15 $ 51.85 $ 39.16 we operate a system of pipelines, terminals and barges to provide crude oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing areas. at december 31, 2006, we owned, leased, operated or held equity method investments in 68 miles of crude oil gathering lines, 3,718 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,855 miles of refined product trunk lines. excluding equity method investees, our owned or operated common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following

total 950 1,043 983 at december 31, 2006 we had interests in the following pipelines: 100 percent ownership of ohio river pipe line llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio, known as cardinal products pipeline; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana to north muskegon, michigan; 51 percent interest in loop llc ("loop"), the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at clovelly, louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 15 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting gulf coast refineries with the midwest market; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois; 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest; 17 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our st. paul park, minnesota refinery; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois to toledo, ohio. our 87 owned and operated light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeast. these facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and trucks. our marine transportation operations include towboats (15 owned) and barges (180 owned, 4 leased) that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. we lease and own over 2,000 rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and over 100 tractors and tank trailers. ethanol production in 2006, we signed a definitive agreement forming a 50/50 joint venture that will construct and operate one or more ethanol production plants. our partner in the joint venture will provide the day-to-day management of the plants, as well as grain procurement, distillers dried grain marketing and ethanol management services. this venture will enable us to maintain the reliability of a portion of our future ethanol supplies. together with our partner, we selected the venture's initial plant site, greenville, ohio, and construction has commenced on a 110 million gallon per year ethanol facility. the facility is expected to be operational as soon as the first quarter of 2008. the above discussion of the rm&amp;t segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the planned expansion of the garyville refinery, potential heavy oil refining upgrading projects and a joint venture that would construct and operate ethanol plants. some factors that could affect the garyville expansion project and the ethanol plant construction, management and development include necessary government and third party approvals, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the garyville project may be further affected by crude oil supply. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. factors that could affect the heavy oil refining upgrading projects include unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements, results of front-end engineering and design work, approval of our board of directors, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, continued favorable investment climate, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. other the energy policy act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard ("rfs") providing that all gasoline sold in the united states contain a minimum of 4.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006. the rfs increases gradually each year until 2012, when the rfs will be 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel. the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") has published a proposed rule to implement the rfs, and we anticipate that a final rule will be published in mid-2007. federal legislation may be proposed in 2007 which may require even greater quantities of renewable fuels. marathon intends to comply with all regulations that are adopted. integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations, methanol operations, and certain other gas processing facilities. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. 16 alaska lng we own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, the lng has been sold under a long-term contract with two of japan's largest utility companies. this contract continues through march 2009, with 2006 lng deliveries totaling 61 gross bcf (19 net bcf). in january 2007, along with our partner, we filed a request with the u.s. department of energy to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through march 2011. equatorial guinea lng in 2004, we and our partner, compania nacional de petroleos de guinea ecuatorial (the national oil company of equatorial guinea or "gepetrol"), through equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ("egholdings"), began construction of a 3.7 million metric ton per annum ("mmtpa") lng production facility on bioko island. we expect to begin delivering 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, during the second quarter of 2007 under a 17-year sales and purchase agreement. the purchaser under this agreement will take delivery of the lng facility's production on an fob bioko island basis with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this project will allow us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the production facility will be purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. we are currently seeking additional natural gas supplies to allow full utilization of this lng facility, which is designed to have a higher capacity and a longer life than the current 17-year sales and purchase agreement. in july 2005, marathon and gepetrol entered into agreements under which mitsui &amp; co., ltd. ("mitsui") and a subsidiary of marubeni corporation ("marubeni") acquired 8.5 percent and 6.5 percent interests in egholdings. in november 2006, gepetrol transferred its 25 percent interest to sociedad nacional de gas de guinea ecuatorial ("sonagas"), which is also controlled by the government of equatorial guinea. following these transaction, we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, with sonagas holding a 25 percent interest and mitsui and marubeni holding the remaining interests. in 2006, with our project partners, we awarded a feed contract for initial work related to a potential second lng production facility on bioko island, equatorial guinea. the feed work is expected to be completed during 2007. the scope of the feed work for the potential 4.4 mmtpa lng project includes feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil off gas compression, product transfer to storage and lng product metering. a final investment decision is expected in early 2008. elba island lng in april 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes at the elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal pursuant to an lng sales and purchase agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as lng) per year, through march 31, 2021 with a possible extension to november 30, 2023. in september 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years. the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. methanol we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production in the alba field. methanol sales totaled 733,680 gross metric tons (330,156 net metric tons) in 2006. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the united states. gas technology we invest in natural gas technology research, including gas-to-liquids ("gtl") technology which offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels. in addition to gtl, we continue to evaluate application of gas technologies accessible through licenses, including methanol-to-power and compressed natural gas. we also continue to develop a 17 proprietary gas-to-fuels ("gtf") technology, which can be configured to convert natural gas resources into premium fuels. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of production associated with the lng production facility and the possible expansion thereof. factors that could affect the lng production facility include unforeseen problems arising from commissioning of the facilities, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other operating considerations such as shipping the lng. in addition to these factors, other factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the current lng production facility and the development of additional lng capacity through additional projects include partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, we currently rank ninth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2006. we compete in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products. we believe we compete with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 70 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; nine refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 260 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa's retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway . we also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in ptc. our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. 18 financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of marathon's principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by marathon: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel's fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for marathon's discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee marathon provided with respect to all of united states steel's obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel's obligations to marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel's accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. tax sharing agreement marathon and united states steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. during 2006, the internal revenue service completed its review of all federal income tax returns filed by usx corporation for taxable periods ending on or prior to the date of the separation. marathon and united states steel have settled all matters related to federal income taxes under this agreement. remaining matters related to state and local income taxes are not expected to have any significant effect on marathon. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2006 see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel" for a discussion of our obligations associated with the separation. 19 environmental matters the corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues identified by management, including environmental matters. our corporate responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving marathon or any of our properties. legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. the kyoto protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. other climate change legislation and regulations both in the united states and abroad are in various stages of development. although there may be financial impact (including compliance costs) associated with any legislation or regulation, the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty of these measures. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ("caa") with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ("cwa") with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ("opa-90") with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies" and "legal proceedings." air of particular significance to our refining operations were u.s. epa regulations that required reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. we achieved compliance with these regulations and began production of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for on-road use prior to the june 1, 2006 deadline. the cost of achieving compliance with these regulations was approximately $850 million. marathon will also be spending approximately $250 million from 2006 through 2010 to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use. further, marathon estimates that it will spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with mobile source air toxics ii regulations relating to benzene. this is a preliminary estimate as the mobile source air toxics ii regulations should be finalized in the first half of 2007. the epa has finalized new and revised national ambient air quality standards ("naaqs") for fine particulate emissions and ozone. in connection with these new standards, the epa will designate certain areas as "nonattainment," meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, in january 2004, the epa proposed a rule called the interstate air quality rule ("iaqr") that would require significant reductions of so2 and nox emissions in numerous states. the final rule was promulgated on may 12, 2005, and the rule was renamed the clean air interstate rule ("cair"). while the epa expects that states will meet their cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units ("egus"), states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. our refinery operations are located in affected states and some states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair 20 requirements; however we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the states have taken further action. water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ("usts") containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm&amp;t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. ongoing rcra-related costs are not expected to be material. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. see legal proceedings environmental proceedings other proceedings for a discussion of these sites. employees we had 28,195 active employees as of december 31, 2006. of that number, 19,132 were employees of ssa, most of whom were employed at our retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2009. the same union represents certain hourly employees at our texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2009. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2009 at our st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2010 at our detroit refinery. available information general

marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. the following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices, as well as refined product gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for oil and natural gas and refined product gross margins fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and refined products. historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of oil, natural gas and refined products are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil, natural gas and refined products; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climatic changes; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of oil and natural gas, as well as on refined product gross margins, are uncertain. lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as lower refined product gross margins, may reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in oil and natural gas prices or refined product gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures and impair the carrying value of our assets. estimates of oil and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our oil and natural gas reserves. the proved oil and natural gas reserves information related to marathon included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group and/or third-party consultants we have retained. the estimates were calculated using oil and natural gas prices in effect as of december 31, 2006, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and 22 assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of oil and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future oil and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and natural gas is produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the oil and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; and the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs. increases in crude oil prices and environmental regulations may reduce our refined product gross margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall rm&amp;t profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refined product gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. in addition, environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our refining, marketing and transportation operations, which may reduce our refined product gross margins. if we do not compete successfully with our competitors, our future operating performance and profitability could materially decline. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. in addition, in implementing our integrated gas strategy, we compete with major integrated energy companies in 23 bidding for and developing liquefied natural gas projects, which are very capital intensive. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional properties and bidding for and developing additional projects, such as lng production facilities. many of our larger competitors in the lng market can complete more projects than we have the capacity to complete, which could lead those competitors to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. in addition, many of our larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas, such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. approximately 56 percent of our oil and natural gas production in 2006 was derived from production outside the united states and approximately 72 percent of our proved reserves as of december 31, 2006, were located outside the united states. there are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of the u.s. government through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the 24 past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. actions by both the united states and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and, therefore, we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather and labor disputes. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. these hazards could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling and production and could materially reduce our profitability. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities. due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. if ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland. as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland in 2005, marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to ashland's interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions. however, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service. if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland. in that event, our indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland. marathon is required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland, which could be material. we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions. under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two "baskets," as described below: basket one this applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland. the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one. upon specified events related to ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would 25 otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two. in addition, basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two. because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland's pre-transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two. the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a "with and without" basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group. thus, if the marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland. because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group's tax liability for a particular year. this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation, ashland is required to repay such compensation to marathon. in the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc that was previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of the interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland. under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than "reasonably equivalent value" or, in some jurisdictions, less than "fair consideration" or "valuable consideration;" and the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. in connection with our transactions with ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland's shareholders. in order to help establish that ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland's interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired. we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland's representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to ashland's existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) ashland's receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) ashland's solvency, it should be noted that the 26 valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon, united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $564 million as of december 31, 2006, including accrued interest of $11 million. if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel. in that event, our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel. under applicable law and regulations, we also may be liable for any defaults by united states steel in the performance of its obligations to fund its erisa pension plans and pay other obligations related to periods prior to the effective date of the separation. united states steel's senior unsecured debt is rated non-investment grade by two major credit rating agencies. the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors' rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. if the transfer of ownership of various assets and operations by marathon's former parent entity to marathon was held to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, united states steel's creditors may be able to obtain recovery from us or other relief detrimental to the holders of our common stock. in july 2001, usx corporation ("old usx") effected a reorganization of the ownership of its businesses in which it created marathon as its publicly owned parent holding company and transferred ownership of various assets and operations to marathon, and it merged into a newly formed subsidiary which survived as united states steel. if a court in a bankruptcy case regarding united states steel or a lawsuit brought by its creditors or their representative were to find that, under the applicable fraudulent conveyance or transfer law: the transfer by old usx to marathon or related transactions were undertaken by old usx with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its existing or future creditors; or old usx received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration, or no value or consideration, in connection with those transactions, and either it or united states steel was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of those transactions, was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature, then that court could determine those transactions entitled one or more classes of creditors of united states steel to equitable relief from us. such a determination could permit the unpaid creditors to obtain recovery from us or could result in other actions detrimental to the holders of our common stock. the measure of insolvency for purposes of these considerations would vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 27 item 1b. unresolved staff comments as of the date of this filing, we have no unresolved comments from the staff of the securities and exchange commission. item 2. properties the location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of marathon have been described previously. except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency. at the date of acquisition of important properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. the properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim. the basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in "financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves" on pages f-46 through f-47. property, plant and equipment additions for property, plant and equipment additions, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity capital expenditures." item 3. legal proceedings marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. certain of these matters are included below. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. however, we believe that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably. natural gas royalty litigation as of december 31, 2005, marathon had been served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and indian lessees violated the false claims act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. the department of justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including marathon. one of the cases, u.s. ex rel jack j. grynberg v. alaska pipeline co., et al, which was primarily a gas measurement case, was dismissed as to marathon on october 20, 2006 on jurisdictional grounds. the second case, u.s. ex rel harrold e. wright v. agip petroleum co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. the wright case is in the discovery phase. in october 2006, marathon was served with an additional qui tam case, filed in the western district of oklahoma, which alleges that marathon violated the false claims act by failing to pay the government past due interest resulting from royalty adjustments for crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon production. the case is styled united states of america ex rel. randy l. little and lanis g. morris v. eni petroleum co., et al. this case asserts that marathon and other defendants are liable for past due interest, penalties, punitive damages and attorneys fees. other than the specific allegation of underpayment for the month of may 2003 in the amount of $1,360, the parties in interest (randy l. little and lanis g. morris) have plead general damages with no other specific amounts against marathon. marathon intends to continue to vigorously defend these cases. powder river basin litigation the u.s. bureau of land management ("blm") completed multi-year reviews of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin, including those in wyoming. the blm signed a record of decision ("rod") on april 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane development. plaintiff environmental and other groups filed suit in may 2003 in federal court against the blm to stop coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin until the blm conducted additional environmental impact studies. marathon intervened as a party in the ongoing litigation before the wyoming federal district court. 28 as these lawsuits to delay energy development in the powder river basin progress through the courts, the wyoming blm continues to process permits to drill under the rod. in may 2004, plaintiff environmental groups environmental defense et al filed suit against the u.s. blm in montana federal district court, alleging the agency did not adequately consider air quality impacts of coal bed methane and oil and gas operations in the powder river basin in montana and wyoming when preparing its environmental impact statements. plaintiffs request that the blm be ordered to cease issuing leases and permits for energy development, until additional analysis of predicted air impacts is conducted. marathon and its subsidiary pennaco energy, inc. intervened in this litigation. mtbe litigation marathon is a defendant along with many other refining companies in over 40 cases in 11 states alleging methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("mtbe") contamination in groundwater. all of these cases have been consolidated in a multi-district litigation in the southern district of new york for preliminary proceedings. the judge in this multi-district litigation ruled on april 20, 2005 that some form of market share liability would apply. market share liability enables a plaintiff to sue manufacturers who represent a substantial share of a market for a particular product and shift the burden of identification of who actually made the product to the defendants, effectively forcing a defendant to show that it did not produce the mtbe which allegedly caused the damage. the judge further allowed cases to go forward in new york and 11 other states, based upon varying theories of collective liability, and predicted that a new theory of market share liability would be recognized in connecticut, indiana and kansas. the plaintiffs generally are water providers or governmental authorities and they allege that refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing mtbe are liable for manufacturing a defective product and that the owners and operators of retail gasoline sites have allowed mtbe to be discharged into the groundwater. several of these lawsuits allege contamination that is outside of marathon's marketing area. a few of the cases seek approval as class actions. many of the cases seek punitive damages or treble damages under a variety of statutes and theories. marathon stopped producing mtbe at its refineries in october 2002. the potential impact of these recent cases and future potential similar cases is uncertain. the company will defend these cases vigorously. product contamination litigation a lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia and alleges that marathon's catlettsburg refinery sold defective gasoline to wholesalers and retailers, causing permanent damage to storage tanks, dispensers and related equipment, resulting in lost profits, business disruption and personal and real property damages. plaintiffs seek class action status. in 2002, mpc conducted extensive cleaning operations at affected facilities and denies that any permanent damages resulted from the incident. mpc previously settled with many of the potential class members in this case and intends to vigorously defend this action. environmental proceedings u.s. epa litigation in 2002, marathon and american petroleum institute ("api") brought a petition before the u.s. district court for the district of columbia, challenging the u.s. epa's 2002 promulgation of new oil spill prevention, countermeasures and control regulations on several grounds; while the dispute has been settled, the one remaining count is over the u.s. epa's regulatory definition of waters covered by the clean water act. marathon and api contend that the u.s. epa's regulations run contrary to recent decisions of the u.s. supreme court which, in finding federal agencies had gone greatly beyond the intentions of congress as to what waters were covered by the clean water act, narrowed the universe of what waters the federal government, rather than state governments, had jurisdiction to regulate. in september 2006, marathon and other oil and gas companies joined the state of wyoming in filing a petition for review against the u.s. epa in the u.s. district court for the district of wyoming. these actions seek a court order mandating the epa to disapprove montana's 2006 amended water quality standards, on grounds that the standards lack sound scientific justification, they are arbitrary and capricious, and were adopted contrary to law. these september 2006 actions have been consolidated with our pending april 2006 action against the u.s. epa in the same court. the water quality amendments at issue, if approved, could require more stringent discharge limits and have the potential to require certain wyoming coal bed methane operations to perform more costly water treatment or inject produced water. approval of these standards could delay or prevent obtaining permits needed to discharge produced water to streams flowing from wyoming into montana. the court has stayed this case, and another filed in april 2006, until august 2007 while the u.s. epa mediates the matter between montana, wyoming and the northern cheyenne tribe. 29 montana litigation in june 2006, marathon filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in montana state district court against the montana board of environmental review ("mber") and the montana department of environmental quality, seeking to set aside and declare invalid certain regulations of the mber that single out the coal bed natural gas industry and a few streams in eastern montana for excessively severe and unjustified restrictions for surface water discharges of produced water from coal bed methane operations. none of the streams affected by the regulations suffers impairment from coal bed natural gas discharges. wyoming proceedings the wyoming environmental quality council ("eqc"), which oversees the state department of environmental quality ("deq"), has before it an administrative petition filed by the powder river basis resource council in 2006 seeking new water quality sulfate and barium standards for coal bed methane produced water and a requirement that all such water be beneficially reused. the petition seeks to expand the authority of deq to regulate the quantity of water discharges. it would narrow the definition of required "beneficial use" discharges and would impose stricter effluent standards for discharged water. the eqc is also considering adoption of a rule which would impose more stringent water quality limits as to produced water discharges that come from any new coal bed methane or conventional oil and gas operations. deq made this proposal citing a statutory directive that all waters that are suitable for agriculture may not be degraded. marathon contends that its waters as currently regulated are beneficial to crops and livestock, rather than being a potential threat. the eqc would have to decide how stringent a water quality standard for new discharges it would adopt. other proceedings the following is a summary of proceedings involving marathon that were pending or contemplated as of december 31, 2006 under federal and state environmental laws. except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management's belief set forth in the first paragraph under "item 3. legal proceedings" above takes such matters into account. claims under cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. potentially responsible parties ("prps") for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. liability is strict and can be joint and several. because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with cercla. the projections of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects provided in the following paragraphs are forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. as of december 31, 2006, marathon had been identified as a prp at a total of nine cercla waste sites. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with six of these sites will be under $1 million per site (with three of these six sites being under $100,000 each). as to the remaining three sites of the nine, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with two of these sites will be under $4 million per site with the last site having costs that cannot be estimated at this time. in addition, there are three sites for which marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla, but for which sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. there are also 119 sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 27 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, that 45 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site and that 19 30 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site. eleven sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site and there are 17 sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs. there is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the michigan department of environmental quality ("mdeq") at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near muskegon, michigan. during the next 30 years, marathon anticipates spending approximately $7 million at this site. in 2007, interim remediation measures will occur and appropriate site characterization and risk-based assessments necessary for closure will be refined and may change the estimated future expenditures for this site. the closure strategy being developed for this site and ongoing work at the site are subject to approval by the mdeq. expenditures in 2006 and 2005 were $488,000 and $540,000, with expenditures in 2007 expected to be approximately $2 million. mpc has had a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general's office since 2002 concerning self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the robinson, illinois refinery. in 2005, mpc received a notice of violation from the u.s. epa alleging 33 violations of clean air act fuels requirements. the alleged violations largely resulted from mpc's attest engagements submitted to the agency under the reformulated gasoline and anti dumping programs. in 2006, mpc reached an administrative settlement with the u.s. epa where mpc paid a civil penalty of $139,000 and resolved this notice of violation. mpc received an enforcement action from the minnesota pollution control agency ("mpca") in the fourth quarter of 2006 where the mpca seeks a civil penalty of $121,800 for a release of catalyst from the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the st. paul park refinery in 2004 and other alleged violations. discussions will be held with the mpca in 2007 and the company expects to resolve the matter within the year. sec investigation relating to equatorial guinea by letter dated july 15, 2004, the united states securities and exchange commission ("sec") notified marathon that it was conducting an inquiry into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea, or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea. this inquiry followed an investigation and public hearing conducted by the united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, which reviewed the transactions of various foreign governments, including that of equatorial guinea, with riggs bank. the investigation and hearing also reviewed the operations of u.s. oil companies, including marathon, in equatorial guinea. there was no finding in the subcommittee's report that marathon violated the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or any other applicable laws or regulations. marathon voluntarily produced documents requested by the sec in that inquiry. on august 1, 2005, marathon received a subpoena issued by the sec pursuant to a formal order of investigation requiring the production of the documents that had already been produced or that were in the process of being identified and produced in response to the sec's prior requests, and requesting the production of additional materials. marathon has been and intends to continue cooperating with the sec in this investigation. item 4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders not applicable. part ii item 5. market for registrant's common equity and related stockholder matters and issuer purchase of equity securities the principal market on which marathon's common stock is traded is the new york stock exchange. marathon's common stock is also traded on the chicago stock exchange. information concerning the high and low sales prices for the common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in "selected quarterly financial data (unaudited)" on page f-42. as of january 31, 2007, there were 64,646 registered holders of marathon common stock. the board of directors intends to declare and pay dividends on marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of marathon oil corporation, although it has no obligation under delaware law or the restated certificate of incorporation to do so. in determining its dividend policy with respect to marathon 31 common stock, the board will rely on the consolidated financial statements of marathon. dividends on marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of marathon. the following table provides information about purchases by marathon and its affiliated purchaser during the quarter ended december 31,

(d) in january 2006, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. in january 2007, our board of directors authorized the extension of this program by an additional $500 million. as of february 21, 2007, the company had repurchased 24.2 million common shares at a cost of $2 billion. item 6. selected financial data (in millions, except per share data) 2006 (a) 2005 (a) 2004 2003 2002 statement of income data: revenues (b) $ 64,896 $ 62,986 $ 49,465 $ 40,907 $ 31,295 income from continuing operations 4,957 3,006 1,294 1,010 507 net income 5,234 3,032 1,261 1,321 516 basic per share data: income from continuing operations $ 13.85 $ 8.44 $ 3.85 $ 3.26 $ 1.63 net income $ 14.62 $ 8.52 $ 3.75 $ 4.26 $ 1.66 diluted per share data: income from continuing operations $ 13.73 $ 8.37 $ 3.83 $ 3.25 $ 1.63 net income $ 14.50 $ 8.44 $ 3.73 $ 4.26 $ 1.66 statement of cash flows data: capital expenditures from continuing operations $ 3,433 $ 2,796 $ 2,141 $ 1,873 $ 1,520 dividends paid 547 436 348 298 285 dividends paid per share $ 1.53 $ 1.22 $ 1.03 $ 0.96 $ 0.92 balance sheet data as of december 31: total assets $ 30,831 $ 28,498 $ 23,423 $ 19,482 $ 17,812 total long-term debt, including capitalized leases 3,061 3,698 4,057 4,085 4,410 (a) on june 30, 2005, marathon acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in mpc previously held by ashland, making it wholly-owned by marathon. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. (b) effective april 1, 2006, marathon changed its accounting for matching buy/sell transactions. this change had no effect on income from continuing operations or net income, but the revenues and cost of revenues recognized after april 1, 2006 are less than the amounts that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 32 item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states; and worldwide marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, and development of other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item 1. business, item 1a. risk factors, item 6. selected financial data and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." e&amp;p segment income during 2006 was up approximately 6 percent from 2005 levels, impacted by increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, primarily due to the resumption of production in libya, and the higher liquid 33 hydrocarbon prices discussed above, partially offset by higher income taxes, primarily in libya, operating costs and exploration expenses and decreases in natural gas sales volumes. refining, marketing and transportation rm&amp;t segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, refinery throughputs, retail marketing gross margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations. the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. we purchase crude oil to satisfy our refineries' throughput requirements. as a result, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other charge and blendstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. the crack spread, which is generally a measure of the difference between spot market gasoline and distillate prices and spot market crude oil costs, is a commonly used industry indicator of refining margins. in addition to changes in the crack spread, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks we process, the selling prices we realize for all the refined products we sell, the cost of purchased product and our level of manufacturing costs. we process significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances our competitive position in the industry as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. over the last three years, approximately 60 percent of the crude oil throughput at our refineries has been sour crude oil. as one of the largest u.s. producers of asphalt, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is also impacted by the selling price of asphalt. sales of asphalt increase during the highway construction season in our market area, which is typically in the second and third quarters of each year. the selling price of asphalt is dependent on the cost of crude oil, the price of alternative paving materials and the level of construction activity in both the private and public sectors. we supplement our refining production by purchasing gasolines and distillates in the spot market to resell at wholesale. in addition, we purchase ethanol for blending with gasoline. our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by the cost of these purchased products, which varies with available supply and demand. finally, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by changes in manufacturing costs from period to period, which are primarily driven by the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas used for plant fuel. our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in our various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and expectations regarding the adequacy of refined product, ethanol and raw material supplies. together with our june 30, 2005 acquisition of the 38 percent minority interest in mpc, our improved refining and wholesale marketing gross margin in 2006 was the key driver of the 72 percent increase in rm&amp;t segment income over 2005. the average refining and wholesale marketing gross margin increased to 22.88 cents per gallon in 2006 from 15.82 cents per gallon in 2005. for information on commodity price risk management, see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." our seven refineries have an aggregate refining capacity of 974 mbpd of crude oil. during 2006, our refineries processed 980 mbpd of crude oil and 234 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks for a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 101 percent. our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of the refined products, including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes, also plays an important part in rm&amp;t segment profitability. factors affecting our retail gasoline and distillate gross margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross margins from the retail sale of gasoline and distillates. factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in our marketing areas. the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through the pipelines. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served 34 by our refined product pipelines. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. the seasonal pattern for distillates is the reverse of this, helping to level overall variability on an annual basis. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. integrated gas our long-term integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand. lng, particularly in regard to our operations in equatorial guinea, is a key component of this integrated gas strategy. our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. also included in the financial results of the ig segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects. methanol spot pricing is volatile largely because global methanol demand is 35 million tons and any major unplanned shutdown of or addition to production capacity can have a significant impact on the supply-demand balance. 2006 operating highlights we announced seven discoveries in angola and norway and continued our major development projects, enhancing our e&amp;p operations by: resuming operations and achieving first crude oil liftings in libya; acquiring leasehold positions in the bakken shale in north dakota and eastern montana and the piceance basin of colorado and adding acreage in the barnett shale in north central texas; progressing the alvheim/vilje development offshore norway and receiving norwegian government approval of the volund field plan for development and operation that includes its tie-back to alvheim; progressing the neptune deepwater gulf of mexico development; signing a production sharing contract for the 1.2 million acre pasangkayu exploration block in indonesia; and completing the sale of our russian oil exploration and production businesses at a gain. we added net proved oil and natural gas reserves of 146 million boe, excluding 45 million boe of dispositions, while producing 134 million boe during 2006. over the past three years, we have added net proved reserves of 648 million boe, excluding dispositions of approximately 46 million boe, while producing approximately 380 million boe. we achieved record refinery crude oil and total throughput and strengthened our rm&amp;t business by: authorizing the projected $3.2 billion expansion of our garyville refinery; completing the tier ii ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel projects on time and under budget; forming an ethanol joint venture and beginning construction of the venture's first ethanol plant in greenville, ohio; awarding a feed contract at the detroit refinery and launching a feasibility study at the catlettsburg refinery for potential heavy oil upgrading projects; and acquiring strategic marine and terminal assets. we increased marathon brand gasoline and diesel sales volumes 6 percent in 2006. we increased speedway superamerica's (ssa) same store gasoline and diesel sales volume 2 percent and merchandise sales 8 percent over 2005. we advanced our integrated gas strategy by: progressing our equatorial guinea lng production facility to near completion, with commissioning begun in late 2006; and awarding a feed contract to evaluate a possible second lng production facility in equatorial guinea. we issued a request for proposals for a potential canadian oil sands venture. 35 critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, economic and political conditions change. during 2006, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 83 million boe (6 percent of the beginning-of-the-year reserves estimate). positive revisions of 98 million boe were partially offset by 15 million boe in negative revisions. our estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates prepared by these teams are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10(a)(2),(3) and (4) of regulation s-x and statement of financial accounting standards ("sfas") no. 25, "suspension of certain accounting requirements for oil and gas producing companies (an amendment of fasb statement no. 19)," and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of sfas no. 69, "disclosures about oil and gas producing activities (an amendment of fasb statements 19, 25, 33 and 39)." all reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by members of our corporate reserves group. any change to proved reserves estimates in excess of 2.5 million boe on a total-field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer. the corporate reserves group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions. third-party consultants are engaged to prepare independent reserve estimates for fields that make up 80 percent of our reserves over a rolling four-year period. at december 31, 2006 we had met this goal. for 2006, marathon established a tolerance level of 10 percent for third-party reserve estimates such that the third-party consultants discontinue their estimation activities once their results are within 10 percent of marathon's internal estimates. should the third-party consultants' initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. if, after this re-examination, the third-party consultants cannot arrive at estimates within our tolerance, we would adjust our reserve estimates as necessary. this independent third-party reserve estimation process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2006, 2005 or 2004. the reserves of the alba field in equatorial guinea comprise approximately 40 percent of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2006. the next five largest oil and gas producing asset groups the waha concessions in libya, the alvheim development offshore norway, the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom, the kenai field in alaska and the oregon basin field in the rocky mountain area of the united states comprise a total of approximately 30 percent of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves. 36 depreciation and depletion of producing oil and natural gas properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved developed reserves. the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant. a five percent increase in the amount of oil and natural gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $6.92 per barrel to $6.59 per barrel, which would increase pretax income by approximately $45 million annually, based on 2006 production. a five percent decrease in the amount of oil and natural gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $6.92 per barrel to $7.28 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $50 million annually, based on 2006 production. fair value estimates we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record non-exchange traded derivative instruments. other items which require fair value estimates include asset retirement obligations, guarantee obligations and stock-based compensation. under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. during 2005, we made two significant acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $3.156 billion that was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions. we did not make any significant acquisitions in 2006. as of december 31, 2006, our recorded goodwill was $1.398 billion. such goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. the fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition and to test goodwill for impairment are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future revenues and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for e&amp;p assets, refinery and associated distribution system level or pipeline system level for refining and transportation assets, or site level for retail stores. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. estimating the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas producing asset groups requires assumptions about matters such as future oil and natural gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas, expected field performance and the political environment in the host country. an impairment of any of our large oil and gas producing properties could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. we evaluate our unproved property investment for impairment based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an undiscounted future net cash flow approach. information such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage are also considered. the expected future cash flows from our rm&amp;t assets require assumptions about matters such as future refined product prices, future crude oil and other feedstock costs, estimated remaining lives of the assets and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets' existing service potential. during 2006, we recorded impairments of $25 million, including $20 million related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline. natural gas production from the camden hills field ended during 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well. we did not have significant impairment charges during 2005. during 2004, we recorded an impairment of $32 million related to unproved properties and $12 million related to producing properties primarily as a result of unsuccessful developmental drilling activity in russia. 37 we record all derivative instruments at fair value. we have two long-term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. these contracts expire in september 2009. these contracts were entered into in the early 1990s in support of our investments in the east brae field and the sage pipeline. contract prices are linked to a basket of energy and other indices. the contract price is reset annually in october based on the previous twelve-month changes in the basket of indices. consequently, the prices under these contracts do not track forward natural gas prices. the fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price to the expected sales volumes under these contracts for the next 18 months. adjustments to the fair value of these contracts result in non-cash charges or credits to income from operations. the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price may fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect income from operations. in 2006, the non-cash gains related to changes in fair value recognized in income from operations were $454 million. non-cash losses of $386 million and $99 million were recognized in 2005 and 2004. these effects are primarily due to the u.k. 18-month forward natural gas price curve weakening 44 percent in 2006, while it strengthened 90 percent and 36 percent during 2005 and 2004. expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. as of december 31, 2006, we reported net deferred tax assets of $1.865 billion, which represented gross assets of $2.554 billion net of valuation allowances of $689 million. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, we consider proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and natural gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies in the event the forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plans and our unfunded u.s. retiree health plans due to the different projected liability durations of 9 years and 13 years. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate modeling tool. this tool applies a yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical aa yield curve. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual discount rates from 1.5 to 30 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. each issue is required to have at least $150 million par value outstanding. the top quartile bonds are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield curve. 38 the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our assumptions are compared to those of peer companies and to historical returns for reasonableness and appropriateness. compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. note 24 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the balance sheets as of december 31, 2006 and 2005. of the assumptions used to measure the december 31, 2006 obligations and estimated 2007 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. a 0.25 percent decrease in the discount rates of 5.80 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 5.90 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $93 million and $28 million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement plan expense by $13 million and $2 million. in 2006, we made certain plan design changes which included an update of the mortality table used in the plans' definition of actuarial equivalence and lump sum calculations and a 20 percent retiree cost of living adjustment for annuitants. this change increased our benefit obligations by $117 million. in 2005, we decreased our retirement age assumption by two years and also increased our lump sum election rate from 90 percent to 96 percent based on changing trends in our experience. this change increased our benefit obligations by $109 million. contingent liabilities we accrue contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. for instance, the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. we generally record these losses as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies, which are recorded as other taxes or provision for income taxes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see "management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies." an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions matching buy/sell transactions arise from arrangements in which we agree to buy a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or refined product to be delivered to a specified location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of the same commodity at a specified location to the same counterparty. prior to april 1, 2006, all matching buy/sell transactions were recorded as separate sale and purchase transactions, or on a "gross" basis. effective for contracts entered into or modified on or after april 1, 2006, the income effects of matching buy/sell 39 transactions are reported in cost of revenues, or on a "net" basis. transactions under contracts entered into before april 1, 2006 will continue to be reported on a "gross" basis. each purchase and sale transaction has the characteristics of a separate legal transaction, including separate invoicing and cash settlement. accordingly, we believed that we were required to account for these transactions separately. an accounting interpretation clarified the circumstances under which a matching buy/sell transaction should be viewed as a single transaction involving the exchange of inventory. for a further description of the accounting requirements and how they apply to matching buy/sell transactions, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. this accounting change had no effect on net income but the amounts of revenues and cost of revenues recognized after april 1, 2006 are less than the amounts that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices. additionally, this accounting change impacts the comparability of certain operating statistics, most notably "refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon." while this change does not have an effect on the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (the numerator for calculating this statistic), sales volumes (the denominator for calculating this statistic) recognized after april 1, 2006 are less than the amount that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices because volumes related to matching buy/sell transactions under contracts entered into or modified on or after april 1, 2006 have been excluded. accordingly, the resulting refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon statistic will be higher than that same statistic calculated from amounts determined under previous accounting practices. the effect of this change on the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon for 2006 was not significant. consolidated results of operations revenues for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 e&amp;p $ 9,010 $ 8,009 $ 6,412 rm&amp;t 55,941 56,003 43,630 ig 179 236 190 segment revenues

both revenues and costs and expenses: consumer excise taxes on petroleum products and merchandise $ 4,979 $ 4,715 $ 4,463 matching crude oil and refined product buy/sell transactions settled in cash: e&amp;p $ 16 $ 123 $ 167 rm&amp;t 5,441 12,513 9,075 total buy/sell transactions included in revenues $ 5,457 $ 12,636 $ 9,242 e&amp;p segment revenues increased $1.001 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $1.597 billion in 2005 from 2004. the 2006 increase was primarily in international revenues due to higher realized liquid hydrocarbon prices and sales volumes as illustrated in the table below. the largest liquid hydrocarbon sales volume increase was in libya, where the first crude oil sales occurred in the first quarter of 2006 and where sales volumes averaged 54 mbpd in 2006, including a total of 8 mbpd that were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations there. revenues from domestic operations were flat from year to year. an 8 percent decrease in domestic net natural gas sales volumes, primarily as the result of the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico ceasing production in early 2006, almost completely offset the benefit of higher liquid hydrocarbon prices in 2006. the 2005 increase in e&amp;p segment revenues over 2004 was primarily the result of higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes partially offset by lower domestic natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes as illustrated in the table below. the decline in domestic 40 volumes in 2005 resulted primarily from weather-related downtime in the gulf of mexico and natural declines in field production rates. 2006 2005 2004 e&amp;p operating statistics net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbpd) (a) united states 76 76

(c) represents marathon's russian oil exploration and production businesses that were sold in june 2006. (d) represents net sales after royalties, except for ireland where amounts are before royalties. (e) includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 46, 38, and 19 mmcfd in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. effective july 1, 2005, the methodology for allocating sales volumes between natural gas produced from the brae complex and third-party natural gas production was modified, resulting in an increase in volumes representing natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale. (f) excludes gains and losses on traditional derivative instruments and the unrealized effects of long-term u.k. natural gas contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. e&amp;p segment revenues included derivative gains of $25 million and $7 million in 2006 and 2005, and derivative losses of $152 million in 2004. excluded from e&amp;p segment revenues were gains of $454 million in 2006 and losses of $386 million and $99 million in 2005 and 2004 related to long-term natural gas sales contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" on page 56. rm&amp;t segment revenues decreased by $62 million in 2006 from 2005 and increased by $12.373 billion in 2005 from 2004. the portion of rm&amp;t revenues reported for matching buy/sell transactions decreased $7.072 billion and increased $3.438 billion in the same periods. the decrease in revenues from matching buy/sell transactions in 2006 was a result of the change in accounting for these transactions effective april 1, 2006, discussed above. excluding matching buy/sell transactions, 2006 revenues increased primarily as a result of higher refined product prices and 41 sales volumes. the 2005 increase primarily reflected higher refined product and crude oil prices and increased refined product sales volumes, partially offset by decreased crude oil sales volumes. for additional information on segment results see page 43. income from equity method investments increased by $126 million in 2006 from 2005 and increased by $98 million in 2005 from 2004. income from our lpg operations in equatorial guinea increased in both periods due to higher sales volumes as a result of the plant expansions completed in 2005. the increase in 2005 also included higher ptc income as a result of higher distillate gross margins. cost of revenues increased $4.609 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $7.106 billion in 2005 from 2004. in both periods the increases were primarily in the rm&amp;t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil, refinery charge and blend stocks and purchased refined products. the increase in both periods was also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses, primarily the result of higher contract services and labor costs in 2006 and higher purchased energy costs in 2005. purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 and increased $3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004, mostly in the rm&amp;t segment. the decrease in 2006 was primarily related to the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above. the increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased crude oil prices. depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $215 million in 2006 from 2005 and $125 million in 2005 from 2004. rm&amp;t segment depreciation expense increased in both years as a result of the increase in asset value recorded for our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30, 2005. in addition, the detroit refinery expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 contributed to the rm&amp;t depreciation expense increase in 2006. e&amp;p segment depreciation expense for 2006 included a $20 million impairment of capitalized costs related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline. natural gas production from the camden hills field ended in 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73 million in 2006 from 2005 and $134 million in 2005 from 2004. the 2006 increase was primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year primarily as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity. partially offsetting these increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense. the increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense, due to the increase in our stock price during that year as well as an increase in equity-based awards, which was partially offset by a decrease in expense as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004. exploration expenses increased $148 million in 2006 from 2005 and $59 million in 2005 from 2004. exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $166 million, $111 million and $47 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004. exploration expense in 2006 also included $47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia. net interest and other financing costs (income) reflected a net $37 million of income for 2006, a favorable change of $183 million from the net $146 million expense in 2005. net interest and other financing costs decreased $16 million in 2005 from 2004. the favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances, foreign currency exchange gains, adjustments to interest on tax issues and greater capitalized interest. the decrease in expense for 2005 was primarily a result of increased interest income on higher average cash balances and greater capitalized interest, partially offset by increased interest on potential tax deficiencies and higher foreign exchange losses. included in net interest and other financing costs (income) are foreign currency gains of $16 million, losses of $17 million and gains of $9 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004. minority interest in income of mpc decreased $148 million in 2005 from 2004 due to our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30, 2005. provision for income taxes increased $2.308 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $979 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the $4.259 billion and $2.691 billion increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes. the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2006 was primarily a result of the income taxes related to our libyan operations, where the statutory income tax rate is in excess of 90 percent. the following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for continuing operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 2006 2005 2004 statutory u.s. income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 9.9 (0.8 ) 0.5 state and local income taxes net of federal income tax effects 1.9 2.5 1.6 other tax effects (2.0 ) (0.4 ) (0.9 ) effective income tax rate for continuing operations 44.8 % 36.3 % 36.2 % 42 discontinued operations for all periods reflects the operations of our former russian oil exploration and production businesses which were sold in june 2006. an after-tax gain on the disposal of $243 million is included in discontinued operations for 2006. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. also included in 2004 is a $4 million adjustment to the gain on the 2003 sale of our exploration and production operations in western canada. cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 was an unfavorable effect of $19 million, net of taxes of $12 million, representing the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation ("fin") no. 47, "accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. 143," as of december 31, 2005. segment results effective january 1, 2006, we revised our measure of segment income to include the effects of minority interests and income taxes related to the segments. in addition, the results of activities primarily associated with the marketing of our equity natural gas production, which had been presented as part of the integrated gas segment prior to 2006, are now included in the exploration and production segment. segment results for all periods presented reflect these changes. as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we sold our russian oil exploration and production businesses during 2006. the activities of these operations have been reported as discontinued operations and therefore are excluded from segment results for all periods presented. segment income for each of the last three years is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 e&amp;p domestic $ 873 $ 983 $ 674 international 1,130 904 416 e&amp;p segment income 2,003 1,887 1,090 rm&amp;t 2,795 1,628 568 ig 16 55 37 segment income 4,814 3,570 1,695 items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: corporate and other unallocated items (212 ) (377 ) (327 ) gain (loss) on long-term u.k. natural gas contracts (a) 232 (223 ) (57 ) discontinued operations 277 45 (33 ) gain on disposition of syria interest 31 deferred income taxes tax legislation changes 21 15 other adjustments (b) 93 loss on early extinguishment of debt (22 ) gain on sale of minority interests in egholdings 21 corporate insurance adjustment (c) (17 ) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (19 ) net income $ 5,234 $ 3,032 $ 1,261 (a) amounts relate to long-term natural gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and recorded at fair value. see "critical accounting estimates fair value estimates" on page 37 for further discussion. (b) other deferred tax adjustments in 2006 represent a benefit recorded for cumulative income tax basis differences associated with prior periods. (c) insurance expense in 2004 related to estimated future obligations to make certain insurance premium payments related to past loss experience. united states e&amp;p income decreased $110 million in 2006 from 2005. this was the result of a $182 million decline in pretax income, partially offset by a slight reduction in the effective income tax rate from 37 percent in 2005 to 36 percent in 2006. the decrease in pretax income was due to increases in variable production costs, exploration expenses, property impairments and depreciation, depletion and amortization. exploration expenses in 2006 were $51 million higher than in 2005, with half of the increase related to a gulf of mexico exploratory dry well. as discussed above, u.s. e&amp;p revenues were flat from 2005 to 2006. u.s. e&amp;p income increased $309 million in 2005 from 2004. this was the result of a $917 million pretax income increase primarily due to higher revenues as discussed above. the effective income tax rate was 37 percent in both 43 years. our cost of storm-related repairs as a result of 2005 hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico was not significant and our gulf of mexico production quickly returned to pre-storm levels. in late september 2004, certain production platforms in the gulf of mexico were evacuated due to hurricane activity. all facilities were back on line by october 1, 2004 with the exception of the petronius platform which came back on line in march 2005. as a result of the damage to the petronius platform, we recorded expense of $11 million in 2004 representing repair costs incurred, partially offset by the net effects of the property damage insurance recoveries and the related retrospective insurance premiums. we recorded income of $53 million in 2005 and $34 million in 2004 for business interruption insurance recoveries. international e&amp;p income increased $226 million in 2006 from 2005, reflecting an increase in pretax income of $1.639 billion and an increase in the effective tax rate from 34 percent in 2005 to 62 percent in 2006. the revenue increase discussed above, primarily related to higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and prices in libya, had the most significant impact on pretax income. depreciation, depletion and amortization and other variable costs increased with increased production to partially offset the revenue increase. exploration expenses also increased $97 million in 2006 compared to 2005. exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs was $68 million in 2006 and $44 million in 2005. also included in 2006 exploration expense was $47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia. the increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of the income taxes related to our libyan operations, where the statutory income tax rate is in excess of 90 percent, and the 2006 increase in the u.k. supplemental corporation tax rate from 10 percent to 20 percent. international e&amp;p income increased $488 million in 2005 from 2004, reflecting an increase in pretax income of $740 million and an effective income tax rate of 37 percent in both years. the revenue increase discussed above had the most significant impact on pretax income. increases in production costs and depletion, depreciation and amortization related primarily to increased production partially offset the benefit of higher revenue. exploration expenses were also higher in 2005. rm&amp;t segment income increased $1.167 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $1.060 billion in 2005 from 2004. segment income in 2006 and 2005 benefited from the 38 percent minority interest in mpc that we acquired on june 30, 2005. pre-tax income increased by $1.802 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $1.766 billion in 2005 from 2004. the pretax earnings reduction related to the minority interest was $376 million in 2005 and $539 million in 2004. the key driver of the increase in rm&amp;t pretax income in both years was our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin which averaged 22.88 cents per gallon in 2006 compared to 15.82 cents in 2005 and 8.77 cents in 2004. the increase in the margin for 2006 reflected wider crack spreads, improved refined product sales realizations, the favorable effects of our ethanol blending program and increased refinery throughputs. in 2005, the margin improved initially due to wider sweet/sour crude oil differentials and later due to the temporary impact that hurricanes katrina and rita had on refined product prices and concerns about the adequacy of distillate supplies heading into that winter. included in the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin were pretax gains of $400 million in 2006 and pretax losses of $238 million in 2005 and $272 million in 2004 related to derivatives utilized primarily to manage price risk. these derivative gains and losses are largely offset by gains and losses on the physical commodity transactions related to these derivative positions. the change from derivative losses to derivative gains reflects both improvements in the realized effects of our derivatives programs as well as unrealized effects as a result of marking open derivatives positions to market. see further discussion under "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." we averaged 980 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2006, or 101 percent of system capacity. we averaged 973 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2005 and 939 mbpd in 2004, representing 102 percent and 99 percent of system capacity for those years. our capacity increased in 2005 as a result of the detroit refinery expansion from 74 to 100 mbpd. the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the rm&amp;t segment for each of the last three years. 2006 2005 2004 rm&amp;t operating statistics refining and wholesale marketing gross margin ($per gallon) (a) $ 0.2288 $ 0.1582 $ 0.0877 refined products sales volumes (mbpd) (b)(c) 1,425 1,455

depreciation. (b) total average daily volumes of refined product sales to wholesale, branded and retail (ssa) customers. (c) on april 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell transactions as a result of a new accounting standard. this change resulted in lower refined product sales volumes for the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under the previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 44 ig segment income decreased $39 million in 2006 from 2005 compared to an increase of $18 million in 2005 from 2004. in 2006, a $17 million pretax loss was recognized as a result of the renegotiation of a technology agreement and income from our equity method investment in ampco was lower due to plant downtime during a planned turnaround and subsequent compressor repair, partially offset by higher realized methanol prices. the provision for income taxes also increased $15 million in 2006. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity financial condition net property, plant and equipment increased $1.642 billion in 2006 primarily as a result of the capital expenditures and the additional capitalized asset retirement costs discussed below. net property, plant and equipment as of the end of the last two years is summarized in the following table. (in millions) 2006 2005 e&amp;p domestic $ 3,636 $ 2,811 international 4,879 4,737 total e&amp;p 8,515 7,548 rm&amp;t 6,452 6,113 ig 1,378 1,145 corporate 308 205 total $ 16,653 $ 15,011 asset retirement obligations increased $333 million in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to upward revisions of previous estimates related to increasing cost estimates, primarily in the united kingdom, and to the accrual of obligations for new properties, primarily the alvheim/vilje development in norway and the lng production facility in equatorial guinea. cash flows net cash provided from operating activities totaled $5.488 billion in 2006, compared with $4.738 billion in 2005 and $3.766 billion in 2004. the $750 million increase in 2006 primarily reflects the impact of higher net income, partially offset by contributions of $635 million to our funded defined benefit pension plans and working capital changes. the 2005 increase mainly resulted from higher net income, partially offset by the effects of receivables which were transferred to ashland at the acquisition date. net cash used in investing activities totaled $2.955 billion in 2006, compared with $3.127 billion in 2005 and $2.324 billion in 2004. significant investing activities include capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and asset disposals. capital expenditures by segment for continuing operations for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table. (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 e&amp;p domestic $ 1,302 $ 638 $ 405 international 867 728 435 total e&amp;p 2,169 1,366 840 rm&amp;t 916 841 794 ig 307 571 488 corporate 41 18 19 total $ 3,433 $ 2,796 $ 2,141 the $637 million increase in capital expenditures in 2006 over 2005 primarily resulted from increased spending in the e&amp;p segment and primarily relates to significant acreage acquisitions in the bakken shale in north dakota and eastern montana and the piceance basin of colorado, as well as to continued work on the alvheim/vilje development offshore norway and the neptune development in the gulf of mexico. the $264 million decrease in integrated gas spending reflects the fact that the lng production facility in equatorial guinea is nearing completion. the $655 million increase in 2005 capital expenditures over 2004 mainly resulted from increased spending related to the alvheim development and the equatorial guinea lng production facility. 45 acquisitions in 2006 primarily included cash payments of $718 million associated with our re-entry into libya. acquisitions in 2005 included cash payments of $506 million for the acquisition of ashland's 38 percent ownership in mpc. for further discussion of acquisitions, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. disposal of assets and of discontinued operations totaled $966 million in 2006, compared with $131 million in 2005 and $76 million in 2004. proceeds of $832 million from the disposal of discontinued operations in 2006 related to the sale of our russian exploration and production businesses in june 2006. in 2006, other disposals of assets included proceeds from the sale of 90 percent of our interest in syrian natural gas fields, ssa stores and other domestic production and transportation assets. in 2005 and 2004, proceeds were primarily from the sale of various domestic producing properties and ssa stores. net cash used in financing activities totaled $2.581 billion in 2006, compared with $2.345 billion in 2005, and net cash provided of $527 million in 2004. significant uses of cash in financing activities during 2006 included common stock repurchases under a previously announced plan, which is discussed under liquidity and capital resources, dividend payments, the repayment of our 6.65% notes that matured during 2006 and the early extinguishment of portions of our outstanding debt. the most significant use of cash in 2005 was related to the repayment of $1.920 billion of debt assumed as a part of the acquisition of ashland's 38 percent of mpc. in 2004, cash provided from financing activities was primarily related to the issuance of 34,500,000 shares of common stock on march 31, 2004, resulting in net proceeds of $1.004 billion. the change from 2004 to 2005 also included an increase in dividends paid and distributions to the minority shareholder of mpc prior to the acquisition, net of an increase in contributions from the minority shareholders of egholdings. derivative instruments see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" on page 56, for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. dividends to stockholders dividends of $1.53 per common share or $548 million were paid during 2006. on january 29, 2007, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.40 cents per share on our common stock, payable march 12, 2007, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 21, 2007. liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed credit facilities and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. our ability to access the debt capital market is supported by our investment grade credit ratings. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor's corporation, moody's investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+, baa1, and bbb+. because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including our capital spending programs, stock repurchase program, repayment of debt maturities and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. during 2006, we entered into an amendment to our $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit agreement, expanding the size of the facility to $2.0 billion and extending the termination date from may 2009 to may 2011. concurrent with this amendment, the $500 million mpc revolving credit facility was terminated. at december 31, 2006, there were no borrowings against this facility. at december 31, 2006, we had no commercial paper outstanding under our u.s. commercial paper program that is backed by the five-year revolving credit facility. during 2006 we entered into a loan agreement which allows borrowings of up to $525 million from the norwegian export credit agency based upon the amount of qualifying purchases by marathon of goods and services from norwegian suppliers. the loan agreement provides for either a fixed or floating interest rate option at the time of the initial drawdown. should we elect to borrow under the agreement, the initial drawdown can only occur in june 2007. as a condition of the closing agreements for the acquisition, we are required to maintain mpc on a stand-alone basis financially through june 30, 2007. during this period of time, capital contributions into mpc are prohibited and mpc is prohibited from incurring additional debt, except for borrowings under an existing intercompany loan facility to fund an expansion project at mpc's detroit refinery and in the event of limited extraordinary circumstances. there are no restrictions against mpc making intercompany loans or declaring dividends to its parent. we believe that the 46 existing cash balances of mpc and cash provided from its operations will be adequate to meet its stand-alone liquidity requirements over the remainder of this two-year period. as of december 31, 2006, there was $1.7 billion aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities or other securities, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for other equity or debt securities available to be issued under the $2.7 billion universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in 2002. our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total-debt-minus-cash to total-debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was six percent at december 31, 2006, compared to 11 percent at year-end 2005 as shown below. this includes $519 million of debt that is serviced by united states steel. (dollars in millions) december 31 2006 2005 long-term debt due within one year $ 471 $ 315 long-term debt 3,061 3,698 total debt $ 3,532 $ 4,013 cash $ 2,585 $ 2,617 equity $ 14,607 $ 11,705 calculation: total debt $ 3,532 $ 4,013 minus cash 2,585 2,617 total debt minus cash 947 1,396 total debt 3,532 4,013 plus equity 14,607 11,705 minus cash 2,585 2,617 total debt plus equity minus cash $ 15,554 $ 13,101 cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio 6 % 11 % during 2006, we extinguished portions of our outstanding debt with a total face value of $162 million. the debt was repurchased at a weighted average price equal to 122 percent of face value. we will continue to evaluate debt repurchase opportunities as they arise. our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. stock repurchase program in january 2006, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. in january 2007, our board of directors authorized the extension of this share repurchase program by an additional $500 million. as of february 21, 2007, we had repurchased 24.2 million common shares at a cost of $2 billion. we anticipate completing the additional $500 million in share repurchases during the first half of 2007. purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. we will use cash on hand, cash generated from operations or cash from available borrowings to acquire shares. this program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. the forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or refining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. 47 contractual cash obligations the table below provides aggregated information on our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31, 2006. summary of contractual cash obligations (in millions) total 2007 2008- 2009 2010- 2011 later years long-term debt (excludes interest) (a)(b) $ 3,398 $ 450 $ 400 $ 143 $ 2,405 sale-leaseback financing (includes imputed interest) (a) 75 20 22 22 11 capital lease obligations (a) 141 16 33 33 59 operating lease obligations (a) 851 154 286 158 253 operating lease obligations under sublease (a) 32 5 11 11 5 purchase obligations: crude oil, refinery feedstock, refined product and ethanol contracts (c) 14,419 12,588 852 655 324 transportation and related contracts 1,445 515 323 201 406 contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment 1,703 935 719 37 12 lng terminal operating costs (d) 178 13 24 25 116 service and materials contracts (e) 602 210 231 81 80 unconditional purchase obligations (f) 62 7 14 14 27 commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) (g) 100 57 31 2 10 total purchase obligations 18,509 14,325 2,194 1,015 975 other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet: defined benefit postretirement plan obligations (h) 1,627 97 164 276 1,090 total contractual cash obligations (i) $ 24,633 $ 15,067 $ 3,110 $ 1,658 $ 4,798 (a) upon the separation, united states steel assumed certain debt and lease obligations. such amounts are included in the above table because marathon remains primarily liable. (b) we anticipate cash payments for interest of $227 million for 2007, $364 million for 2008-2009, $357 million for 2010-2011 and $1.387 billion for the remaining years for a total of $2.335 billion. (c) the majority of these contractual obligations as of december 31, 2006 relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of 2007. these contracts include variable price arrangements and some contracts are accounted for as nontraditional derivatives. (d) we have acquired the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal. the agreement's primary term ends in 2021. pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the terminal. (e) service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (f) we are a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with alliance pipeline. this agreement is used by alliance pipeline to secure its financing. this arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. see note 30 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our guarantee. (g) commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs. (h) we have obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. we have estimated projected funding requirements through 2016. (i) includes $581 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. for additional information, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel" on page 49. off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources; and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. we have provided various forms of guarantees to unconsolidated affiliates, united states steel and others. these arrangements are described in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements. 48 we are a party to an agreement that would require us to purchase, under certain circumstances, the interest in pilot travel centers llc ("ptc") not currently owned. this put/call agreement is described in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements. nonrecourse indebtedness of investees certain of our investees have incurred indebtedness that we do not support through guarantees or otherwise. if we were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata ownership basis, our share would have been $340 million as of december 31, 2006. of this amount, $217 million relates to ptc. if any of these investees default, we have no obligation to support the debt. our partner in ptc has guaranteed $75 million of the total ptc debt. obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary, united states steel, to holders of our usx u. s. steel group class of common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. united states steel's obligations to marathon are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel's accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. if united states steel fails to satisfy these obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. as of december 31, 2006, we have identified the following obligations totaling $564 million that have been assumed by united states steel: $415 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $11 million at december 31, 2006. $60 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel's fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2006. $44 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel's clairton coke-making facility, with a term extending to 2012. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2006. $34 million of operating lease obligations, $31 million of which was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee of all obligations of united states steel as general partner of clairton 1314b partnership, l.p. to the limited partners. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. for further discussion of the clairton 1314b guarantee, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $564 million, obligations of $530 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2006 (current portion $32 million; long-term portion $498 million). the remaining $34 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. 49 the table below provides aggregated information on the portion of our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by united states steel as of december 31, 2006: summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel (in millions) total 2007 2008- 2009

steel. marathon and united states steel have entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended on or before december 31, 2001. in 2006 and 2005, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement, we paid $35 million and $6 million to united states steel in connection with the settlement with the internal revenue service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of usx corporation for the years 1995 through 2001. the final payment of $13 million to united states steel related to u.s. federal income tax returns under the tax sharing agreement was made in january 2007. united states steel reported in its form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2006, that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. however, united states steel management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. transactions with related parties we own a 63 percent working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea. we own a 52 percent interest in an onshore lpg processing plant in eg through an equity method investee, alba plant llc. additionally, we own a 45 percent interest in an onshore methanol production plant through ampco, an equity method investee. we sell our marketed natural gas from the alba field to alba plant llc and ampco. ampco uses the natural gas to manufacture methanol and sells the methanol through another equity method investee, ampco marketing llc. sales to our 50 percent equity method investee, ptc, which consists primarily of refined petroleum products, accounted for two percent or less of our total sales revenue for 2006, 2005 and 2004. ptc is the largest travel center network in the united states and operates 269 travel centers in the united states and canada. prior to the acquisition on june 30, 2005, ashland was a related party as a result of its 38 percent minority interest in mpc. during that time, we sold refined petroleum products consisting mainly of petrochemicals, base lube oils and asphalt to ashland. our sales to ashland accounted for less than one percent of our total sales revenue for 2005 and 2004. we believe that these transactions were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. marathon holds a 60 percent interest, sonagas holds a 25 percent interest, mitsui holds an 8.5 percent interest and marubeni holds a 6.5 percent interest in egholdings. as of december 31, 2006, total expenditures of $1.363 billion, including $1.300 billion of capital expenditures, related to the equatorial guinea lng production facility have been incurred. cash of $234 million held in escrow to fund future contributions from sonagas to egholdings is classified as restricted cash and is included in investments and long-term receivables as of december 31, 2006. our current receivables from and payables to the interest holders in egholdings are $13 million and $232 million as of december 31, 2006, including a payable to sonagas of $229 million. management's discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. 50 however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. our environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were (a) : (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 capital $ 166 $ 390 $ 433 compliance operating &amp; maintenance 319 250 215 remediation (b) 20 25 32 total $ 505 $ 665 $ 680 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 5 percent of capital expenditures for continuing operations in 2006, 14 percent in 2005 and 20 percent in 2004. we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $159 million or 8 percent of capital expenditures in 2007. predictions beyond 2007 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $277 million in 2008; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. of particular significance to our refining operations were u.s. epa regulations that required reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. we achieved compliance with these regulations and began production of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for on-road use prior to the june 1, 2006 deadline. the cost of achieving compliance with these regulations was approximately $850 million. we will also be spending approximately $250 million from 2006 through 2010 to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use. further, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with mobile source air toxics ii regulations relating to benzene. this is a preliminary estimate as the mobile source air toxics ii regulations should be finalized in the first half of 2007. during 2001, mpc entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering all of its refineries. the settlement committed mpc to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to its refineries over approximately an eight-year period. in addition, mpc has been working on certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations and these have been substantially completed. the oil industry across the u.k. continental shelf is making reductions in the amount of oil in its produced water discharges pursuant to the department of trade and industry initiative under the oil pollution prevention and control regulations ("ospar") of 2005. in compliance with these regulations, we have almost completed our ospar project for the brae field to make the required reductions of oil in its produced water discharges. our share of capital costs for the project is $7 million. for information on legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see "item 3. legal proceedings." 51 outlook capital, investment and exploration budget we approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $4.242 billion for 2007, which includes budgeted capital expenditures of $3.886 billion. this represents a 16 percent increase over 2006 actual spending. the primary focus of the 2007 budget is to find additional oil and natural gas reserves, develop existing fields, strengthen rm&amp;t assets and continue implementation of the integrated gas strategy. the budget includes worldwide production spending of $1.429 billion primarily in the united states, norway, libya and ireland. the worldwide exploration budget of $802 million includes plans to drill 14 to 17 significant exploration or appraisal wells. other activities will focus primarily on areas within or adjacent to our onshore producing properties in the united states. the budget includes $1.464 billion for rm&amp;t, primarily for refining projects including the 180 mbpd garyville refinery expansion project and the feed for a potential detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading project which would allow us to process increased volumes of canadian oil sands production. the rm&amp;t budget also includes increased investments in transportation and logistics, a strategically important area of the business, including the expansion of our ethanol blending capabilities at terminals in the midwest and southeast. the integrated gas budget of $331 million is primarily for completion of the lng processing facility in equatorial guinea, as well as feed expenditures associated with a potential expansion of that facility. the remaining $216 million is designated for capitalized interest and corporate activities. exploration and production the seven announced discoveries in 2006 (six in deepwater angola and one in norway) resulted from our balanced exploration strategy which places an emphasis on near-term production opportunities, while retaining an appropriate exposure to longer-term options. major exploration activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include those: offshore angola, where we have participated in 13 discoveries on block 31, in which we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest. in 2006, we announced the urano, titania and terra discoveries, as well as an unnamed discovery. current plans call for a potential development area in the northeastern part of block 31, which encompasses the plutao, saturno, marte, venus and terra discoveries. the remaining discoveries are being evaluated for potential development. we have secured rig capacity for and plan to participate in exploration wells on block 31 during 2007; offshore angola on block 32 in which we hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest and where we participated in five discoveries through 2006, gindungo, canela, gengibre, mostarda and salsa, and announced two additional discoveries in 2007, manjericao and caril. these discoveries move block 32 closer toward establishment of a commercial development. we have secured rig capacity for and plan to participate in exploration wells on block 32 during 2007; in equatorial guinea, where we are evaluating development scenarios for the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, one of which includes production through the alba field infrastructure and the future lng production facility on bioko island. we own a 63 percent interest in the alba block and serve as operator; in norway, where we now own interests in 15 licenses in the norwegian sector of the north sea and plan to drill one or two exploration wells during 2007; and in the gulf of mexico, where we plan to participate in two to three exploration wells during 2007. we have secured rig capacity to drill two wells and our ability to drill the third well depends upon securing additional rig capacity. during 2006, we continued to make progress in advancing key development projects that will help serve as the basis for our production growth profile in the coming years. major development and production activities currently underway or under evaluation include those: in libya, where we re-entered the waha concessions at the end of 2005 and achieved first production in january 2006. we continue to work with our partners to maximize the potential of this major asset. we own a 16.33 percent outside-operated interest in the approximately 13 million acre waha concessions; in norway, where our alvheim/vilje development will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. construction on the project is nearly complete and commissioning has commenced. first production is expected during the second quarter 2007, at which time four wells will be available, and drilling activities will continue into 2008. a peak net production rate of 75 mboepd is expected in early 2008. the alvheim development includes the kneler, boa 52 and kameleon fields in which we own a 65 percent interest and serve as operator. we own a 47 percent outside-operated interest in the nearby vilje discovery. also, plans for development of the volund discovery as a tie-back to the alvheim development were approved by the norwegian government in early 2007. first production is expected from volund in the second quarter of 2009. we own a 65 percent interest in volund and serve as operator; in the gulf of mexico, where the neptune development is on target for first production by early 2008. we own a 30 percent outside-operated interest in neptune; in ireland, where the corrib natural gas development project has re-commenced and we expect first production in 2009. we own a 19 percent outside-operated interest in corrib; in the piceance basin where we plan to drill approximately 700 wells over the next ten years, with first production expected in late 2007; and in the bakken shale where we plan to drill approximately 300 locations over the next five years. we estimate that our 2007 production available for sale will average approximately 390 to 425 mboepd, excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. with the developments we have under construction, we estimate our production available for sale will grow to 465 to 520 mboepd by 2010, excluding acquisitions and dispositions. projected liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production available for sale is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. in 2006, we issued a request for proposals to engage interested parties in a process that could lead to a canadian oil sands venture. this process is intended to explore various commercial arrangements under which we would provide heavy canadian oil sands crude oil processing capacity in exchange for an equity interest in a canadian oil sands project through a joint venture, or other alternative business arrangements that potential partners may choose to propose. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the timing of production from the neptune development, the piceance basin, the combined alvheim/vilje development, the volund field and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. except for the alvheim/vilje and volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments in blocks 31 and 32 could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the above discussion also contains forward-looking statements concerning a potential canadian oil sands venture. factors that could affect the formation of a canadian oil sands venture include unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements, results of front-end engineering and design work, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, continued favorable investment climate, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. refining, marketing and transportation throughout 2006, we remained focused on our strategy of leveraging refining and marketing investments in core markets, as well as expanding and enhancing our asset base while controlling costs. our 2006 average daily crude oil throughput exceeded the record throughput achieved in 2005. in 2006, our board of directors approved a projected $3.2 billion expansion of our garyville refinery by 180 mbpd to 425 mbpd, which will increase our total refining capacity to 1.154 mmbpd. we recently received air permit approval from the louisiana department of environmental quality for this project and construction is expected to begin in mid-2007, with startup planned for the fourth quarter of 2009. when completed, this expansion will enable the refinery to provide an additional 7.5 million gallons of clean transportation fuels to the market each day. 53 we have also commenced front-end engineering and design for a potential heavy oil upgrading project at our detroit refinery which would allow us to process increased volumes of canadian oil sand production and are undertaking a feasibility study for a similar upgrading project at our catlettsburg refinery. in 2006, we signed a definitive agreement forming a joint venture that will construct and operate one or more ethanol production plants. our partner in the joint venture will provide the day-to-day management of the plants, as well as grain procurement, and distillers dried grain marketing and ethanol management services. this venture will enable us to maintain the reliability of a portion of our future ethanol supplies. together with our partner, we selected the venture's initial plan site, greenville, ohio, and construction has commenced on a 110 million gallon per year ethanol facility. the facility is expected to be operational as soon as the first quarter of 2008. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the planned expansion of the garyville refinery, potential heavy oil refining upgrading projects and a joint venture that would construct and operate ethanol plants. some factors that could affect the garyville expansion project and the ethanol plant construction, management and development include necessary government and third party approvals, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the garyville project may be further affected by crude oil supply. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. factors that could affect the heavy oil refining upgrading projects include unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements, results of front-end engineering and design work, approval of our board of directors, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, continued favorable investment climate, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. integrated gas construction of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea continues ahead of its original schedule with the first shipments of lng projected for the second quarter of 2007. construction is nearly complete and commissioning has commenced. we own a 60 percent interest in equatorial guinea lng holdings limited. we are currently seeking additional natural gas supplies to allow full utilization of this lng facility, which is designed to have a higher capacity and a longer life than the current contract to supply 3.4 million metric tons per year for 17 years. once the equatorial guinea lng production facility commences its principal operations and begins to generate revenue, we must assess whether or not egholdings continues to be a variable interest entity ("vie"). we consolidate egholdings because it is a vie and we are its primary beneficiary. despite the fact that we hold majority ownership, we would not consolidate egholdings if it ceased to be a vie because the minority shareholders have substantive participating rights. if egholdings ceased to be a vie, we would account for our interest using the equity method of accounting. in 2006, with our project partners, we awarded a feed contract for initial work related to a potential second lng production facility on bioko island, equatorial guinea. the feed work is expected to be completed during 2007. the scope of the feed work for the potential 4.4 million metric tones per annum lng facility includes feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil off gas compression, product transfer to storage and lng product metering. a final investment decision is expected in early 2008. atlantic methanol production company llc underwent a scheduled maintenance shutdown in 2006, during which bottlenecks in several parts of the plant were also removed. deliveries resumed in october 2006 and ampco expects to reach its full expansion capacity during 2007. the above discussion contains forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of production associated with the lng production facility and the possible expansion thereof. factors that could affect the lng production facility include unforeseen problems arising from commissioning of the facilities, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other operating considerations such as shipping the lng. in addition to these factors, other factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the current lng production facility and the development of additional lng capacity through additional projects include partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 54 accounting standards not yet adopted in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 159, "the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities." this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. it requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be recorded in net income. the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. for us, sfas no. 159 will be effective january 1, 2008, and retrospective application is not permitted. should we elect to apply the fair value option to any eligible items that exist at january 1, 2008, the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value would be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. we are currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, "fair value measurements." this statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but may require some entities to change their measurement practices. for us, sfas no. 157 will be effective january 1, 2008, with early application permitted. we are currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. in september 2006, the fasb issued fasb staff position ("fsp") no. aug air-1, "accounting for planned major maintenance activities." this fsp prohibits the use of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods. we expense such costs in the same annual period as incurred; however, estimated annual major maintenance costs are recognized as expense throughout the year on a pro rata basis. as such, adoption of fsp no. aug air-1 will have no impact on our annual consolidated financial statements. we are required to adopt the fsp effective january 1, 2007. we do not believe the provisions of fsp no. aug air-1 will have a significant impact on our interim consolidated financial statements. in july 2006, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. 48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109." fin no. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with sfas no. 109, "accounting for income taxes." fin no. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the new standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, transition and disclosure. for us, the provisions of fin no. 48 are effective january 1, 2007. we do not believe adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in march 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 156, "accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no. 140." this statement amends sfas no. 140, "accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities," with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. we are required to adopt sfas no. 156 effective january 1, 2007. we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in february 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 155, "accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no. 133 and 140." sfas no. 155 simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments, eliminates the interim fasb guidance which provides that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets are not subject to the provisions of sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," and eliminates the restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity may hold. for us, sfas no. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued on or after january 1, 2007. we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 55 item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options to manage exposure to market fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we use commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. to a lesser extent, we are exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials and on purchases of ethanol. our strategy generally has been to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. we use a variety of derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses. as market conditions change, we evaluate our risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume greater market risk. our e&amp;p segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on portions of our future production when deemed advantageous to do so. we also use derivatives to protect the value of natural gas purchased and injected into storage in support of production operations. we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas on purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes. our rm&amp;t segment uses commodity derivative instruments: to mitigate the price risk: between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products, on fixed price contracts for ethanol purchases, associated with anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use, and associated with freight on crude oil, feedstocks and refined product deliveries; to protect the value of excess refined product, crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas inventories; to protect margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers; to protect against decreases in future crack spreads; and to take advantage of trading opportunities identified in the commodity markets. we use financial derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure on certain foreign currency denominated capital expenditures, operating expenses and tax payments. we use financial derivative instruments to manage certain interest rate risk exposures. as we enter into these derivatives, assessments are made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting. we believe that our use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material risk. however, the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. 56 commodity price risk sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations ("ifo") of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005, are provided in the following table: (in millions) commodity derivative instruments (b)(c) : 10% 25% 10% 25% crude oil (d) $ $ $ 11 (e) $ 25 (e) natural gas (d) 47 (e) 119 (e) 78 (e) 195 (e) refined products (d) 11 (f) 28 (f) 6 (e) 15 (e) (a) we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity. effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. amounts reflect hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in closing commodity prices, excluding basis swaps, for each open contract position at december 31, 2006 and 2005. included in the natural gas impacts shown above are effects related to the long-term u.k. natural gas contracts, which were $54 million in 2006 and $90 million in 2005, for hypothetical price changes of 10 percent and were $138 million in 2006 and $225 million in 2005 for hypothetical price changes of 25 percent. we evaluate our portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. the creditworthiness of counterparties is reviewed continuously and master netting agreements are used when practical. changes to the portfolio after december 31, 2006, would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented in this table. (b) the number of net open contracts for the e&amp;p segment varied throughout 2006, from a low of 316 contracts on june 27, 2006 to a high of 1,634 contracts on january 2, 2006, and averaged 1,054 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the rm&amp;t segment varied throughout 2006, from a low of 166 contracts on december 7, 2006 to a high of 25,123 contracts on august 23, 2006, and averaged 13,154 for the year. the derivative commodity instruments used and positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects. (c) the calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated. gains and losses on options are based on changes in intrinsic value only. (d) the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would result in the largest incremental decrease in ifo when applied to the commodity derivative instruments used to hedge that commodity. (e) price increase. (f) price decrease. e&amp;p segment derivative gains of $25 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005 and losses of $152 million in 2004 are included in e&amp;p segment results. additionally, losses from discontinued cash flow hedges of $3 million are included in 2004 segment results. the discontinued cash flow hedge amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur. the results of activities primarily associated with the marketing of our equity natural gas production, which had been presented as part of the integrated gas segment prior to 2006, are included in the e&amp;p segment for all periods presented. excluded from e&amp;p segment results were gains of $454 million in 2006 and losses of $386 million in 2005 and $99 million in 2004 related to long-term natural gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. for additional information on these u.k. natural gas contracts, see "fair value estimates" on page 37. at december 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no open derivative contracts related to our oil and natural gas production and therefore remained substantially exposed to market prices of commodities. in 2004, we reduced our exposure to market prices of commodities on 26 percent of crude oil production and 7 percent of natural gas production. we continue to evaluate the commodity price risks related to our production and may enter into commodity derivative instruments when it is deemed advantageous. as a particular but not exclusive example, we may elect to use commodity derivative instruments to achieve minimum price levels on some portion of our production to support capital or acquisition funding requirements. 57 rm&amp;t segment we do not attempt to qualify commodity derivative instruments used in our rm&amp;t operations for hedge accounting. as a result, we recognize in net income all changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our rm&amp;t operations. pretax derivative gains and losses included in rm&amp;t segment income for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: strategy (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 mitigate price risk $ 204 $ (57 ) $ (106 ) protect carrying values of excess inventories 200 (118 ) (98 ) protect margins associated with fixed price sales (4 ) 18 8 protect crack spread values (81 ) (76 ) subtotal, non-trading activities 400 (238 ) (272 ) trading activities 1 (87 ) 8 total net derivative gains (losses) $ 401 $ (325 ) $ (264 ) derivatives used in non-trading activities have an underlying physical commodity transaction. since the majority of rm&amp;t segment derivative contracts are for the sale of commodities, derivative losses generally occur when market prices increase and typically are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transactions. conversely, derivative gains generally occur when market prices decrease and are typically offset by losses on the underlying physical commodity transactions . the income effect related to derivatives and the income effect related to the underlying physical transactions may not necessarily be recognized in net income in the same period because we do not attempt to qualify these commodity derivative instruments for hedge accounting. the year-to-year change in the net impact of derivatives primarily reflects changes in market conditions. other commodity related risks we are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. for example, new york mercantile exchange ("nymex") contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana's henry hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices. if commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. these regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. over-the-counter transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk. we are impacted by liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position. due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions. 58 interest rate risk we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations which affect the fair value of certain financial instruments. a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table: (in millions) december 31, 2006 december 31, 2005 fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) financial assets (liabilities) (a) : investments and long-term receivables $ 461 $ $ 268 $ interest rate swap agreements (d) $ (22 ) $ 9 $ (30 ) $ 14 long-term debt (d)(e) $ (3,729 ) $ (132 ) $ (4,354 ) $ (152 ) (a) fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, commercial paper, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. (b) see notes 18 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for carrying value of these instruments. (c) for long-term debt, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of our long-term debt at december 31, 2006 and 2005. for interest rate swap agreements, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the effective swap rate at december 31, 2006 and 2005. (d) fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. (e) includes amounts due within one year. at december 31, 2006 and 2005, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to the effects of interest rate fluctuations. this sensitivity is illustrated by the $132 million increase in the fair value of long-term debt at december 31, 2006, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates. however, our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affect our results of operations and cash flows when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. we manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio. we have entered into several interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. the following table summarizes our interest rate swaps as of december 31, 2006: (dollars in millions) floating rate to be paid fixed rate to be received notional amount swap maturity fair value six month libor +1.935% 5.375 % $ 450 2007 $ (4 ) six month libor +3.285% 6.850 % $ 400 2008 $ (8 ) six month libor +2.142% 6.125 % $ 200 2012 $ (10 ) 59 foreign currency exchange rate risk we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward and option contracts. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our exposure to movements in the foreign currency markets by locking in foreign currency rates. at december 31, 2006, the following currency derivatives were outstanding. all contracts currently qualify for hedge accounting. (dollars in millions) period notional amount forward rate (a) fair value (b) foreign currency rate forwards: euro july 2007 november 2008 $ 51 1.255 (c) $ 3 kroner (norway) january 2007 october 2009 $ 127 6.213 (d) $ (a) rates shown are weighted average all-in forward rates for the period. (b) fair value was based on market rates. (c) u.s. dollar to foreign currency. (d) foreign currency to u.s. dollar. the aggregate effect on foreign currency forward contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change to exchange rates at december 31, 2006, would be approximately $14 million. credit risk we are exposed to significant credit risk from united states steel arising from the separation. that exposure is discussed in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel. safe harbor these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management's opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and other feedstocks. if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to our hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 60quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipates , believes , estimates , expects , forecasts , plans , predicts or projects or variations of these words, suggesting that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements with respect to marathon may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves, proved or otherwise, of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on the business and financial condition; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. and 2. business and properties general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of old usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001 (the holding company reorganization ), usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction discussed in the next paragraph (the separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon steel business. on december 31, 2001, marathon disposed of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, marathon certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and, from that date, marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. marathon principal operating subsidiaries are marathon oil company and marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ). marathon oil company and its predecessors have been engaged in the oil and gas business since 1887. map is 62-percent owned by marathon and 38-percent owned by ashland inc. marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through map; and other energy related businesses. operating highlights during 2003, marathon: realized continued exploration success with nine discoveries offshore angola, norway, gulf of mexico, and equatorial guinea. maintained financial discipline and flexibility: completed non-core asset rationalization program generating proceeds over $1.2 billion; initiated business transformation with projected annual savings of $135 million starting in 2004; 2 table of contents lowered the cash adjusted debt-to-capital ratio to 33 percent at year-end; and increased the quarterly dividend from 23 to 25 cents per share. established and strengthened core areas: achieved 2003 reserve replacement of 124 percent excluding dispositions; established core growth area in russia with the acquisition of khanty mansiysk oil corporation ( kmoc ); initiated production from equatorial guinea phase 2a condensate expansion project and continued progress on phase 2b liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) expansion; and acquired interests in three additional norwegian production licenses. advanced integrated gas strategy: signed heads of agreement with equatorial guinea government and gepetrol covering fiscal terms of a proposed liquefied natural gas ( lng ) project in equatorial guinea; signed letter of understanding with bg group for long-term lng offtake agreement for proposed lng project in equatorial guinea; and signed statement of intent with qatar petroleum to study a gas-to-liquids ( gtl ), lpg, and condensate project in qatar. strengthened map: commenced an expansion project to increase the capacity of the detroit, michigan refinery by 26,000 barrels per day; neared completion of catlettsburg, kentucky refinery repositioning project; increased refinery efficiencies and feedstock throughputs at garyville, louisiana and texas city, texas; enhanced logistics network with the acquisition of an additional interest in the centennial pipeline and start-up

consolidated financial statements on page f-20. exploration and production marathon is currently conducting exploration and development activities in nine countries. principal exploration activities are in the united states, norway, equatorial guinea, angola, and canada. principal development activities are in the united states, the united kingdom, ireland, norway, equatorial guinea, gabon, and russia. marathon is also pursuing opportunities in north and west africa and the middle east. at year-end 2003, marathon was producing crude oil and/or natural gas in seven countries, including the united states. marathon worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production, including marathon proportionate share of equity investees production, decreased six percent from 2002 levels. marathon 2003 worldwide sales of natural gas production, including marathon proportionate share of equity investees production and gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, decreased approximately five percent from 2002. in total, marathon 2003 worldwide production averaged 389,000 barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ) per day, including discontinued operations and impacts of acquisitions and dispositions, compared to 412,000 boe per day in 2002. in 2004, marathon worldwide production is expected to average 365,000 boe per day, excluding acquisitions and dispositions. the above projection of 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and natural gas volumes is a forward-looking statement. some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of production include pricing, supply 3 table of contents and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, future acquisitions or dispositions of producing properties, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statement. united states including marathon proportionate share of equity investee production, approximately 57 percent of marathon 2003 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and 63 percent of its worldwide natural gas production was produced from u.s. operations. marathon ongoing u.s. strategy is to apply its technical expertise in fields with undeveloped potential, to dispose of interests in non-core properties with limited upside potential and high production costs, and to acquire interests in properties with upside potential. during 2003, marathon drilled 21 gross (11 net) exploratory wells of which 15 gross (9 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 15 wells, 3 gross (2 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. marathon principal u.s. exploration, development, and producing areas are located in the gulf of mexico and the states of texas, new mexico, alaska, wyoming, and oklahoma. u.s. southern business unit gulf of mexico during 2003, marathon share of gulf of mexico production averaged 53,500 barrels per day ( bpd ) of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 48 percent of marathon total u.s. liquid hydrocarbon production, and 135 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ) of natural gas, representing 18 percent of marathon total u.s. natural gas production. liquid hydrocarbon production decreased by 9,000 net bpd and natural gas production increased by 32 net mmcfd from the prior year. the decrease in liquid hydrocarbon production is mainly due to natural field decline. the increase in natural gas production is related to a full year of camden hills production in 2003 and new production from petronius drilling, partially offset by other natural field declines. at year-end 2003, marathon held interests in 10 producing fields and 17 platforms, of which 7 platforms are operated by marathon. in 2003, marathon announced the neptune-5 discovery, which is located in atwater valley block 574 in 6,215 feet of water. this well was drilled to a total depth of 19,142 feet and encountered more than 500 feet of net oil pay. although several hydrocarbon-bearing intervals are present, one interval has a gross hydrocarbon column thickness of more than 1,200 feet. two appraisal sidetrack wells were also drilled. the first sidetrack well, drilled down-dip from the original neptune-5 location, encountered a similar thickness of net oil pay and penetrated an oil water contact, which extended the gross oil column by approximately 100 feet. the second sidetrack, drilled to an up-dip location, encountered approximately 190 feet of net oil pay in several intervals. marathon and its partners in the neptune unit are integrating the results of this discovery into field development studies. marathon holds a 30 percent interest in the neptune unit. also announced in 2003, the perseus discovery is located on viosca knoll block 830 in 3,376 feet of water, approximately five miles from the existing petronius platform. the well was drilled to a total depth of 13,134 feet and encountered over 130 net feet of oil pay in the primary targets. the perseus discovery is expected to begin production in 2004 via an extended reach well currently being drilled from the petronius platform and extend the plateau of the petronius production profile. marathon holds a 50 percent interest in the perseus discovery and the petronius development. petronius is currently producing a gross average of 60,000 bpd and 100 mmcfd. the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for marathon with the potential to add new reserves and increase production. at the end of 2003, marathon had interests in 149 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 90 in the deepwater area. permian basin the permian basin region extends from southeast new mexico to west texas. marathon share of production in this region averaged 30,200 bpd and 132 mmcfd in 2003, compared to 32,400 bpd and 146 mmcfd in 2002. the reduction in liquid hydrocarbon and gas production was primarily due to the impact of the disposition of properties. 4 table of contents in june 2003, mkm partners l.p. ( mkm ), a joint venture of marathon and kinder morgan energy partners l.p. ( kinder morgan ), sold its interest in the sacroc unit to kinder morgan. also in june 2003, mkm was dissolved and its interest in the yates field was distributed to marathon and kinder morgan. in november 2003, marathon sold its interest in the yates field to kinder morgan. these properties contributed approximately 9,000 net bpd to 2003 production. east texas production in the east texas gas fields averaged 73 net mmcfd in 2003 compared to 84 net mmcfd in 2002. the volume decrease was primarily due to property dispositions totaling approximately 11 mmcfd and natural field decline. active development of the mimms creek field continued in 2003 with marathon drilling 22 wells. the 2003 drilling program has resulted in mimms creek net production increasing from 9 net mmcfd to a peak of 17 net mmcfd. u.s. northern business unit alaska marathon primary focus in alaska is the expansion of its natural gas business through exploration, development and marketing. marathon share of production from alaska averaged 166 mmcfd of natural gas in 2002 and 2003. in september 2003, marathon began producing gas from its ninilchik unit in the cook inlet. production is currently flowing at a gross rate of 41 mmcfd, 21 mmcfd of which is net to marathon, and is being transported through the recently completed kenai kachemak pipeline, which connects ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the kenai peninsula, anchorage and other parts of south-central alaska. marathon operates the ninilchik unit and holds a 60 percent interest in it and the kenai kachemak pipeline. wyoming liquid hydrocarbon production for 2003 averaged 21,400 net bpd compared with 22,800 net bpd in 2002. the decrease was primarily attributed to dispositions of approximately 1,000 net bpd of liquids in non-core areas of wyoming. average gas production increased to 127 net mmcfd in 2003, compared to 125 net mmcfd in 2002. in early 2001, marathon completed the acquisition of pennaco energy inc., creating a new core area of coal bed natural gas production in the powder river basin ( prb ) of wyoming. marathon expanded its prb assets by approximately one-third in may 2002 as a result of the acquisition of the assets owned by its major partner in this basin. marathon now controls more than 650,000 net acres in northeast wyoming and southeast montana and is the largest individual acreage holder in the prb. during 2003, marathon drilled approximately 320 wells. for 2003, production rates of coal bed natural gas were 82 net mmcfd, compared to 79 net mmcfd in 2002. oklahoma gas production for 2003 averaged 96 net mmcfd, compared with 108 net mmcfd in 2002. the decrease in gas production was primarily due to natural field decline. in 2003, marathon southern anadarko basin exploration efforts continued to focus on the western extension of the cement and marlow fields. exploration drilling efforts resulted in five discoveries. international including marathon proportionate share of equity investee production, approximately 43 percent of marathon 2003 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and 37 percent of its worldwide natural gas production was produced from international operations. during 2003, marathon drilled 54 gross (36 net) exploratory wells of which 47 gross (32 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. of these 47 wells, 21 gross (14 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. europe u.k. north sea marathon primary asset in the u.k. north sea is the brae area complex where it is the operator and owns a 42 percent interest in the south, central, north, and west brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities act as the host for the underlying south brae field, adjacent central brae field and west brae/sedgwick fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field are gas-condensate fields. these fields are produced using the gas cycling technique, whereby gas is injected into the reservoir for pressure maintenance, improved sweep efficiency and increased condensate liquid recovery. although partial cycling continues, the majority of north brae gas is being transferred to the east brae reservoir for pressure maintenance and sales. 5 table of contents marathon share of production from the brae area averaged 17,500 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2003, compared with 20,100 bpd in 2002. the decrease resulted from the natural decline in existing fields partially offset by successful development and remedial well work. marathon share of brae gas sales averaged 198 mmcfd in 2002 and 2003. gas sales continue to be maximized on available capacity within the pipeline system. the strategic location of the brae platforms and pipeline infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, there are 19 agreements with third-party fields contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae-area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the facilities. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the beryl group owns the other 50 percent. the sage pipeline provides transportation for brae and beryl area gas and has a total wet gas capacity of approximately 1,000 mmcfd. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland provides processing for gas from the sage pipeline and processing for 0.8 bcfd of third party gas from the britannia field. during 2003, marathon and its partners announced the startup of oil and gas production from the marathon-operated braemar field in the u.k. north sea. the field was developed with a single subsea well tied back to the east brae platform 7.5 miles to the south where liquids and gas are processed. marathon holds a 26 percent interest in braemar. production from the field commenced in september 2003 at an initial condensate rate of 3,700 gross bpd and was increased in january 2004 to approximately 5,300 bpd. in august 2002, a 16-inch pipeline link, linkline, between the marathon operated brae b platform and the outside-operated miller platform was sanctioned. marathon has a 19 percent interest in the linkline. the linkline will initially be used for transportation of braemar gas that has been contracted to the miller group for operational purposes. as part of the ongoing rationalization of the european business unit, marathon added one new block (16/1) to its inventory, and exited four blocks (22/7,22/22c,16/3d and 16/6a-s). this resulted in an overall reduction of its uk leasehold interests from 24 blocks at the start of 2003 to 21 blocks as of december 31, 2003. u.k. atlantic margin marathon has an approximately 30 percent interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex. this is made up of a 28 percent interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent of east foinaven and 20 percent of the single well t35 and t25 accumulations. three successful wells were drilled in 2003. marathon share of production from the foinaven fields averaged 22,400 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10 mmcfd in 2003, compared to 31,000 net bpd and 9 mmcfd in 2002. lower production of liquid hydrocarbons was due to a five-month compressor outage, completion failure in two water injection wells, and early water breakthrough in a number of main-field producers. the compressor was returned to service in november 2003 and a remedial program is planned to address the well problems in 2004. in december 2003, production from foinaven was averaging 25,100 net bpd and 11 net mmcfd. ireland marathon holds a 100 percent interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale fields in the irish celtic sea. natural gas sales were 62 net mmcfd in 2003, compared with 81 net mmcfd in 2002. the decrease in sales is primarily the result of the timing effect associated with annual storage injection versus storage withdrawals for the kinsale storage facility, and natural field decline. marathon further developed the kinsale head area in 2003 by drilling and developing an additional subsea gas well. the greensand subsea gas well is designed to enhance the productivity of the main kinsale head natural gas producing greensand reservoir and has been tied back to marathon existing kinsale head bravo platform. production began in july 2003. during 2002, an agreement was entered into with the seven heads group to provide gas processing and transportation services, as well as field operating services, for the seven heads gas being brought to the kinsale offshore production facilities beginning in 2003. production from seven heads commenced in december 2003. under this agreement, marathon provides capacity to process and transport between 60 mmcfd to 100 mmcfd of seven heads gas. marathon has an 18.5 percent interest in the corrib gas development project, located approximately 40 miles off ireland west coast. on april 30, 2003, an irish planning authority denied the application for the proposed onshore terminal to bring ashore gas from the corrib field. in late 2003, the project partners submitted a new application to the planning authority. marathon has reclassified approximately 14 million boe from proved undeveloped reserves until the terminal application is approved, which is expected to be in late 2004. 6 table of contents norway in the norwegian north sea, marathon share of production averaged 1,600 bpd and 16 mmcfd in 2003, compared to 800 bpd and 15 mmcfd in 2002. marathon owns a 24 percent interest in the heimdal field and gas-condensate processing center. marathon owns a 47 percent interest in the vale field which is located northeast of the heimdal field in 374 feet of water. this single subsea well tied back to the heimdal platform came on line in june 2002. a further exploration well was drilled on this license in 2003 and resulted in an oil discovery called the klegg field. the klegg well was drilled to a total depth of 7,799 feet and encountered a gross oil column of approximately 223 feet. an evaluation of development options is underway with a decision expected in 2004. marathon has a 20 percent interest in the byggve/skirne gas-condensate field, currently in development on license pl102. this two well development is being tied back to the heimdal platform gas processing center, with first production expected early 2004. condensate export will be via the heimdal-brae-forties system and gas export from the heimdal transportation center. on april 15, 2003, marathon announced the success of the first well of its 2003 norwegian continental shelf exploration program on the kneler prospect in the alvheim area. located approximately 140 miles from stavanger, norway in 390 feet of water, the kneler exploration well was drilled to total depth of 7,425 feet and encountered high quality crude oil in a gross oil column of 155 feet with 115 net feet of pay in the heimdal formation. on may 27, 2003, marathon announced a second discovery in the alvheim area on the boa well. the discovery well is located approximately 4.5 miles northwest of the kneler discovery. the boa well was drilled into the heimdal formation to a total depth of 7,531 feet. this well encountered an 82 foot gross gas column and a 92 foot gross oil column. marathon and its partners are evaluating several development scenarios for alvheim, in which marathon is operator and holds a 65 percent interest. marathon expects to submit a development plan to the norwegian authorities during the second quarter of 2004. in december 2003, marathon continued to grow its position offshore norway by acquiring interests in three additional production licenses. marathon is operator of two of the three licenses with 100 percent working interest (pl.307 and pl.311) and 40 percent in the third (pl.304). work obligations have been established to promote rapid exploration of these offshore areas. netherlands divestment of marathon interest in clam petroleum b.v. ( clam ) was completed in may 2003. west africa equatorial guinea during 2002, in two separate transactions, marathon acquired interests totaling 63 percent in the alba field. additionally, in these transactions, marathon acquired a net 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant and a 45 percent net interest in an onshore methanol production plant, both held through separate equity method investees. the large scale alba field phase 2 expansion, which began in 2002, made significant progress in 2003. the field development and condensate production expansion portions of the project (phase 2a) were greater than 90% complete at year end, with completion expected around april 1 st of 2004. work completed in 2003 included: the fabrication and installation of two new offshore platforms, installation of production flowlines, installation of gas re-injection lines between the offshore platforms and marathon facilities on bioko island, drilling and completion of five new development wells, tie-back and completion of three pre-drilled wells, construction of additional condensate storage tanks on bioko island, and installation of onshore pipelines and facilities to stabilize and transfer the increased production levels. as a result of the phase 2a expansion, gross condensate production had grown from 18,000 to 30,000 bpd (15,800 net) at the end of 2003. at the completion of phase 2a, gross condensate production will be further increased to approximately 54,000 bpd (30,000 net). 7 table of contents the second phase of additional development (phase 2b) includes fabrication and installation of a full process steam lpg cryogenic gas plant and associated storage, marine terminal, and fractionation equipment for propane and heavier gas components. this addition is expected to result in additional gross condensate production of 5,000 (2,600 net) bpd. additionally, 20,000 (11,600 net) bpd of lpg is expected to be recovered. phase 2b is expected to be completed near the end of 2004 raising total liquid production to a level of approximately 79,000 bpd. on july 23, 2003, marathon announced a natural gas discovery on block d offshore equatorial guinea, where marathon is operator with a 90 percent interest. the discovery well is on the bococo prospect, located in 238 feet of water, approximately six miles west of the alba gas/condensate field. the well was drilled to a depth of 6,110 feet and encountered 185 feet of net gas pay. the well has been suspended for reentry at a later date. the bococo gas discovery complements three earlier dry gas discoveries on block d for future development. marathon is currently evaluating the results of the recently drilled deep luba prospect, which will test for potential resources under the alba field. this well was drilled from an alba platform, which could enable early production if successful. gabon marathon is operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and marin fields with a 56 percent working interest. production in gabon averaged 14,700 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2003, compared with 16,700 net bpd in 2002. the decrease is attributable to the timing of liftings. development work during 2003 brought production levels at the tchatamba fields up to the facility capacity of approximately 42,000 gross bpd. angola offshore angola, marathon has a 10 percent working interest in block 31 and a 30 percent working interest in block 32. in 2002, marathon participated in the first ultra-deepwater discovery in block 31. the discovery, the plutao 1-a, was drilled to a total depth of 14,607 feet and tested 5,357 bpd through a 48/64 inch choke. in 2003, marathon announced additional discoveries in block 31, including the saturno-1 and marte-1 wells. the saturno-1 was drilled to a total depth of 15,444 feet and tested at a maximum rate of 5,000 bpd. the marte-1 discovery well was drilled to a total depth of 13,756 feet and tested at a maximum rate of 5,200 bpd. development options for block 31 are currently being evaluated. also on block 31, marathon has participated in the venus well, which has reached total depth. results of the venus well will be reported upon government approvals. in 2003, marathon announced the first discovery on block 32. the gindungo-1 well was drilled in a water depth of 4,739 feet and successively tested at rates of 7,400 and 5,700 barrels of light oil per day from two separate zones. also on block 32, marathon has participated in the canela well located approximately 8 miles south of the gindungo discovery on block 32. the canela well has reached total depth. results of the canela well will be reported upon government approvals. other international russia on may 13, 2003 marathon oil corporation announced that it had completed the acquisition of kmoc for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $285 million, including the assumption of $31 million in debt. kmoc currently produces approximately 16,000 net bpd in the khanty mansiysk region of western siberia in the russian federation. western canada on october 1, 2003, marathon completed the sale of the operations in western canada for $612 million. eastern canada in 2002, marathon announced a gas discovery at the annapolis g-24 deepwater wildcat well approximately 215 miles south of halifax, nova scotia in 5,504 feet of water. the g-24 encountered approximately 100 feet of net gas pay over several zones. marathon is operator and has a 30 percent interest in the annapolis lease. in addition, marathon is operator of the adjacent empire and cortland leases with 50 percent and 75 percent interests, respectively. during 2003, 3-d seismic was acquired over both blocks to better define the trend. qatar marathon and three other companies are parties to a memorandum of understanding to further explore the possibility of developing a portion of the north field offshore qatar. marathon and its partners are pursuing technical and commercial discussions with qatar petroleum that could lead to a gtl, lpg and condensate project as part of the northern field development. libya marathon is a member of the oasis group, which acquired exploration and production rights in six concessions in the mid-1950s. marathon has a 16.3 percent interest in these concessions. in 1986, the oasis group ceased active participation in the concessions following the imposition of trade sanctions by the u. s. government. 8 table of contents in 2002, the u. s. state department reaffirmed the authority of the oasis group to hold discussions with representatives of the libyan national oil company and the libyan government relative to the future of the concessions. based on the u.s. government recent announcement on february 26, 2004, the oasis group is in active discussions with the libyan national oil company concerning the negotiation of terms for their eventual return to the country. the above discussions include forward-looking statements concerning the phase 2a and phase 2b expansion projects, including estimated completion dates, development plans, expected production levels, dates of initial production, which are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, amount of capital available for exploration and development, worldwide supply and demand for petroleum products, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production decline rates of mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability, unforeseen problems arising from construction and other geological, operating and economic considerations. offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the gulf of mexico, the north sea, the u.k. atlantic margin, the celtic sea, offshore nova scotia and offshore west africa are also subject to severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. in addition, development of new production properties in countries outside the united states may require protracted negotiations with host governments and is frequently subject to political considerations and tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate and/or negotiations and other considerations are not satisfactorily resolved, actual results could be materially different than present expectations. reserves at december 31, 2003, marathon net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, including its proportionate share of equity investees net proved reserves, totaled approximately 1.0 billion boe, of which 46 percent were located in the united states. (for purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain boe.) proved developed reserves represented 70 percent of total proved reserves as of december 31, 2003, as compared to 78 percent as of december 31, 2002. the decrease primarily reflects the disposition of the yates field. of the just over 300 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2003, only 10 percent have been included as proved reserves for more than two years. on a boe basis, excluding dispositions, marathon replaced 124 percent of its 2003 worldwide oil and gas production. excluding acquisitions and dispositions, marathon replaced 76 percent of worldwide oil and gas production. 9 table of contents the following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years. estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at december 31 developed developed and undeveloped 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 liquid hydrocarbons (millions of barrels) united states 193 226 243 210 245 268 europe 47 63 69 59 76 88 west africa 120 113 14 218 203 17 other international 31 2 89 3 total consolidated continuing operations 391 404 326 576 527 373 equity investees (a) 2 177 178 2 183 184 worldwide continuing operations 393 581 504 578 710 557 discontinued operations (b) 9 11 10 13 worldwide 393 590 515 578 720 570 developed reserves as % of total net proved reserves 68.0% 81.9% 90.4% natural gas (billions of cubic feet) united states 1,067 1,206 1,308 1,635 1,724 1,793 europe 421 408 473 484 562 615 west africa 528 552 665 653 total consolidated continuing operations 2,016 2,166 1,781 2,784 2,939 2,408 equity investee (c) 36 32 59 51 worldwide continuing operations 2,016 2,202 1,813 2,784 2,998 2,459 discontinued operations (b) 290 308 379 399 worldwide 2,016 2,492 2,121 2,784 3,377 2,858 developed reserves as % of total net proved reserves 72.4% 73.8% 74.2% total boe (millions of barrels) united states 371 427 461 483 532 567 europe 117 132 148 139 170 190 west africa 208 205 14 329 312 17 other international 31 2 89 3 total consolidated continuing operations 727 766 623 1,040 1,017 774 equity investees (a) 2 183 183 2 193 193 worldwide continuing operations 729 949 806 1,042 1,210 967 discontinued operations (b) 57 62 73 79 worldwide 729 1,006 868 1,042 1,283 1,046 developed reserves as % of total net proved reserves 70.0% 78.4% 83.0% (a) represents marathon equity interests in llc jv chernogorskoye ( chernogorskoye ), mkm and clam. mkm was dissolved and the yates interest was sold in 2003. marathon interest in clam was sold in 2003.

gas oil may be moved from robinson to detroit where excess fluid catalytic cracking unit capacity is available; and light cycle oil may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess desulfurization capacity is available. map also produces asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. map manufactures petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, map manufactures aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene and slack wax. during 2003, map refineries processed 917,000 bpd of crude oil and 138,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. the following table sets forth map refinery production by product group for each of the last three years: refined product yields (thousands of barrels per day) 2003 2002 2001 gasoline 567 581 581 distillates 284 285 286 propane 21 21 22 feedstocks and special products 93 80 69 heavy fuel oil 24 20 39 asphalt 72 72 76 total 1,061 1,059 1,073 planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. map initiated major turnarounds at its catlettsburg, garyville, and texas city refineries in 2003. technology upgrades and expansions of the fluid catalytic cracking units ( fccu ) at the garyville and texas city refineries were completed during early 2003. these projects have increased combined fccu capacity by over 20,000 bpd, and resulted in improved yields, reduced operating costs, and enhanced reliability of these facilities. 14 table of contents at its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has completed the approximately $440 million multi-year integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. this program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur (tier 2) gasoline. project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. in the fourth quarter of 2003, map commenced approximately $300 million in new capital projects for its 74,000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. one of the projects, a $110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100,000 bpd. other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. marketing in 2003, map refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 19.8 billion gallons (1,293,000 bpd). excluding sales related to matching buy/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map refined product sales volumes in 2003. approximately 50 percent of map gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003. approximately half of map propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. the map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. the following table sets forth the volume of map consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 2003 2002 2001 gasoline 776 773 748 distillates 365 346 345 propane 21 22 21 feedstocks and special products 97 82 71 heavy fuel oil 24 20 41 asphalt 74 75 78 total 1,357 1,318 1,304 matching buy/sell volumes included in above 64 71 45 map sells reformulated gasoline in parts of its marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin. map also sells low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. as of december 31, 2003, map supplied petroleum products to approximately 3,900 marathon and ashland branded retail outlets located primarily in michigan, ohio, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in florida, georgia, wisconsin, west virginia, minnesota, tennessee, virginia, pennsylvania, north carolina, south carolina and alabama. 15 table of contents retail sales of gasoline and diesel fuel were also made through company-operated outlets by ssa. as of december 31, 2003, this subsidiary had 1,775 retail outlets in 9 states that sold petroleum products and convenience-store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names speedway and superamerica. ssa revenues from the sale of convenience-store merchandise totaled $2.2 billion in 2003, compared with $2.4 billion in 2002. profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. during 2003, ssa withdrew from markets in the southeast when it sold 190 convenience stores located in florida, south carolina, north carolina and georgia for approximately $140 million plus store inventory. pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ), a joint venture with pilot corporation ( pilot ), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with approximately 260 locations in 34 states. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand name restaurants. on february 27, 2003, ptc purchased 60 retail travel centers from the williams companies located in 15 states, primarily in the midwest, southeast and southwest. pilot and map each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. map retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand, and continued growth for ptc. supply and transportation map obtains the crude oil it processes from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. in 2003, map net purchases of u.s. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged 422,000 bpd, including a net 30,000 bpd from marathon. in 2003, canada was the source for 13 percent or 122,000 bpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 41 percent or 373,000 bpd of the crude oil processed by map refineries, including approximately 225,000 bpd from the middle east. this crude was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and traders. map operates a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to its refineries and refined products to its marketing areas. at december 31, 2003, map owned, leased, or had an ownership interest in approximately 3,073 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,850 miles of product trunk lines. map owns a 47 percent interest in loop llc ( loop ), which is the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana; a 50 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; and a 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois. map also has a 33 percent ownership interest in minnesota pipe line company, which owns a crude oil pipeline in minnesota. minnesota pipe line company provides map with access to crude oil common carrier transportation from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of map st. paul park, minnesota refinery. on february 10, 2003, map increased its ownership in centennial pipeline llc from 33 percent to 50 percent and as of december 31, 2003, map and texas eastern products pipeline company, l.p. own centennial pipeline llc 50 percent each. the centennial pipeline system connects gulf coast refineries with the midwest market. in the fourth quarter 2003, a map subsidiary, ohio river pipe line llc, completed the construction of the cardinal products pipeline, which extends from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio. the first deliveries from the pipeline occurred in late december 2003. the pipeline is an interstate common carrier pipeline and is expected to initially move approximately 36,000 bpd of refined petroleum into the central ohio region. the pipeline, which has a capacity of up to 80,000 bpd, is expected to provide a stable, cost effective supply of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to this market. map 88 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeast. these facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. map marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. map also leases and owns rail cars in various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors, tank trailers and general service trucks. 16 table of contents the above rm&amp;t discussions include forward-looking statements concerning anticipated completion of refinery projects and the operation of the cardinal products pipeline. some factors that could potentially cause actual results for the refinery projects to differ materially from present expectations include (among others) price of petroleum products, levels of cash flow from operations, unforeseen problems arising from construction, regulatory approval constraints and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and delays in construction. some factors that could affect the pipeline system include the price of petroleum products and other supply issues. this forward-looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ from those presently anticipated. other energy related businesses marathon operates other businesses that market and transport its own and third-party natural gas, crude oil and products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. some of these businesses, as well as other business projects under development, comprise marathon integrated gas strategy. marathon owns an interest in the following pipeline systems: a 29 percent interest in odyssey pipeline llc and a 28 percent interest in poseidon oil pipeline company, llc (both gulf of mexico crude oil pipeline systems); a 24 percent interest in nautilus pipeline company, llc and a 24 percent interest in manta ray offshore gathering company, llc (both gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems); a 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company (a light product pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest); and a 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company (a light product pipeline system extending from chicago, il to toledo, oh). none of these refined product systems are part of map. marathon also holds interests in some smaller offshore gulf of mexico oil pipeline systems. marathon owns a 34 percent ownership interest in the neptune natural gas processing plant located in st. mary parish, louisiana, which commenced operations on march 20, 2000. the plant has the capacity to process 300 mmcfd of natural gas, which is supplied by the nautilus pipeline system, and is being expanded to 600 mmcfd capacity effective early 2004. in addition to the sale of its own oil and natural gas production, marathon purchases oil and gas from third party producers and marketers for resale. marathon owns a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefication plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of marathon natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, the lng has been sold under a long-term contract with two of japan largest utility companies. marathon has a 30 percent participation in this contract, which will continue through march 31, 2009. lng deliveries totaled 66 gross bcf (22 net bcf) in 2003. on january 3, 2002, marathon acquired a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea from cms energy. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of marathon natural gas production in the alba field. methanol production totaled 836,000 gross metric tons (376,000 net metric tons) in 2003. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. in august 2002, marathon acquired the rights to deliver up to 58 bcf of lng annually to the elba island lng terminal near savannah, georgia. the contract has a 17-year term with an option to extend for an additional five-year period. the agreement provides for the right to deliver lng under a put option with the capacity owner of the facility and, under certain conditions, take redelivery of natural gas for onward sale to third parties. marathon atlantic basin integrated gas activity centers around the monetization of marathon gas reserves from the alba field. this proposed project would involve construction of a 3.4 million metric tonnes per year lng facility located on bioko island, equatorial guinea, with startup currently projected for late 2007. in the second quarter of 2003, marathon, the government of equatorial guinea, and gepetrol, the national oil company of equatorial guinea, signed a heads of agreement on fiscal terms and conditions for the development of the lng facility. in addition, marathon signed a letter of understanding with bg gas marketing, ltd. ( bgml ), a subsidiary of bg group plc, under which bgml would purchase the lng plant production for a period of 17 years. bgml has stated its intent to deliver the lng primarily to the lng receiving terminal in lake charles, louisiana, where it would be regasified and delivered into the gulf coast natural gas pipeline grid. the provisions of the letter of understanding are subject to a definitive purchase and sale agreement, which the parties expect to finalize in the second quarter of 2004. 17 table of contents in the pacific basin, one of the integrated gas projects marathon has been pursuing, the tijuana regional energy center, will not proceed. marathon has been unable to make significant progress on this project, principally due to the lack of local and regional support that would be necessary to obtain land use and other key permits. more recently, the baja california state government announced plans to expropriate land, on which marathon and its partners held options to purchase, that would have been the site for the proposed project. marathon has been engaged in gtl research and development since the early 1990s with the goal of creating a process and facility capable of converting natural gas into ultra-clean diesel fuel. currently, marathon is participating in a gtl demonstration plant at the port of catoosa near tulsa, oklahoma. dedicated during the fourth quarter of 2003, this complex is part of the department of energy ultra-clean fuels program. this gtl technology development is being pursued in conjunction with marathon proposed qatar gtl project. in the first quarter of 2004, marathon will realign its segment reporting. a new segment, integrated gas, will be introduced and the other energy related businesses ( oerb ) segment will be eliminated. of the business activities discussed above, the gulf of mexico crude oil pipeline systems, crude oil marketing activities and the catoosa demonstration plant will be reported in the exploration and production segment. the refined products pipeline systems will be reported in the refining, marketing and transportation segment. the remaining activities will comprise the integrated gas segment which will consist of lng facilities, certain midstream gas plants and pipelines, non-equity natural gas marketing activity, and continued execution of other integrated gas strategies in the atlantic and pacific basins, which may or may not be connected to marathon e&amp;p activity. for further information, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook on page 47. the above oerb discussion contains forward looking statements concerning the plans for a lng facility and a lng offtake transaction. factors that could affect the plans for the lng plant and lng offtake transaction include the successful negotiation and execution of definitive purchase and sale agreements for gas supply and lng offtake, board approval of the transactions, approval of the lng project by the government of equatorial guinea, unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, competition with similar projects, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. marathon competes with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of marathon competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to marathon. as a consequence, marathon may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and gas. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. marathon also competes in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, marathon believes it currently ranks eighth among u.s.-based petroleum corporations on the basis of 2002 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. marathon through map must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. map believes it ranks fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of crude oil refining capacity as of january 1, 2004. map competes in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products and believes it competes with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 80 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; 11 refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 275 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. marathon competes in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway . marathon also competes in the travel center industry through its 50 percent ownership in ptc. 18 table of contents marathon operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets it serves. generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001 ( reorganization agreement ), marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. thomas j. usher is chairman of the board of both companies, and, as of december 31, 2003, four of the ten remaining members of marathon board of directors are also directors of united states steel. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all marathon principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by marathon: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for marathon discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. $2 million of the industrial revenue bonds are scheduled to mature in the period extending through december 31, 2009. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. united states steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed lease obligations. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee marathon provided with respect to all united states steel obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it is required to fund 19 table of contents accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. tax sharing agreement marathon and united states steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. provisions of this agreement include the following: for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before december 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between marathon and united states steel generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation; no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after december 31, 2001; and provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free transaction and limitations on post-separation activities that might jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation. under the general tax sharing principles in effect before the separation: the taxes payable by each of the marathon group and the u.s. steel group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return; and the u.s. steel group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable. in accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the separation, marathon made a preliminary settlement with united states steel of approximately $440 million as the net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended december 31, 2001 under the pre-separation tax sharing principles. the tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended before december 31, 2001. in the tax sharing agreement, each of marathon and united states steel promised the other party that it: would not, before january 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, jeopardize the tax-free status of the separation; and would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from the separation ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction. the prescribed actions and transactions include: the liquidation of marathon or united states steel; and the sale by marathon or united states steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business. 20 table of contents in case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability. even if the separation otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code, the separation may become taxable to marathon under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either marathon or united states steel is acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the separation. for this purpose, a 50 percent or greater interest means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. to minimize this risk, both marathon and united states steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their equity structures that could cause the separation to be treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the internal revenue code may apply. if an acquisition occurs that results in the separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that acquisition transaction. although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the separation, each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the separation, is jointly and severally liable under the internal revenue code for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. marathon can provide no assurance, however, that united states steel will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2003 see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on page 43 for a discussion of marathon obligations associated with the separation. environmental matters marathon maintains a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the corporate governance and nominating committee of marathon board of directors. marathon health, environment and safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that marathon operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. the health, environment and safety management committee, which is comprised of officers of marathon, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. marathon also has an emergency management team, composed of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving marathon or any of its properties. marathon businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where marathon operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters. these laws and their associated regulations are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on marathon for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for marathon acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable, due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 21 table of contents amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies on page 45 and legal proceedings on page 24. air of particular significance to map are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in the manufacture of gasoline and on-road diesel fuel starting in 2004 and 2006, respectively. marathon estimates that map combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules could amount to approximately $900 million, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects, between 2002 and 2006. some factors that could potentially affect map gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits, completion of project detailed engineering, and project construction and logistical considerations. the u.s. epa has finalized new and revised national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions (pm2.5) and ozone. in connection with these new standards, epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas do not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas epa has proposed a rule called the interstate air quality rule ( iaqr ) that will require significant reductions of so2 and nox emissions in numerous states. all of marathon refinery operations are located within these affected states. if this rule is finalized, it could have a significant impact on marathon operations as well as the operations of many of marathon competitors. at this time, marathon cannot determine whether the iaqr will be finalized or whether it will be substantially changed before it is final. as a result, marathon cannot presently reasonably estimate the financial impact of such a rule. water marathon maintains numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and has implemented systems to oversee its compliance efforts. in addition, marathon is regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. as of december 31, 2003, all of the barges used in map river transportation operations meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. marathon operates facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which marathon operates have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. marathon has implemented emergency oil response plans for all of its components and facilities covered by opa-90. solid waste marathon continues to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in its operations. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. since the epa has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of rcra and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the implementing regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance with this statute cannot be accurately estimated. in addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. 22 table of contents remediation marathon owns or operates certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. marathon obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which it operates. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement fund once the applicable deductible has been satisfied. accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. as a general rule, marathon and ashland retained responsibility for certain remediation costs arising out of the prior ownership and operation of businesses transferred to map. such continuing responsibility, in certain situations, may be subject to threshold or sunset agreements, which gradually diminish this responsibility over time. properties the location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of marathon have been described previously. except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. the plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency. at the date of acquisition of important properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. the properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim. the basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in consolidated financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves on pages f-45 through f-46. property, plant and equipment additions for property, plant and equipment additions, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity capital expenditures on page 40. employees marathon had 27,007 active employees as of december 31, 2003, including 23,556 map employees. of the total number of map employees, 17,139 were employees of speedway superamerica llc, most of whom were employees at retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at the catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the paper, allied-industrial, chemical and energy workers international union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2006. the same union represents certain hourly employees at the texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2006. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at the st. paul park and detroit refineries under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2006 and january 31, 2007, respectively. available information general information about marathon, including the corporate governance principles and charters for the audit committee, compensation committee, corporate governance and nominating committee, and committee on financial policy, can be found at www.marathon.com. in addition, marathon code of business conduct and code of ethics for senior financial officers is available on the website at www.marathon.com/values/ corporate_governance/. marathon annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k, as well as any amendments and exhibits to those reports, are available free of charge through the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed or furnished with the sec. these documents are also available in hard copy, free of charge, by contacting marathon investor relations office. information contained on marathon website is not incorporated into this form 10-k or other securities filings. 23 table of contents item 3. legal proceedings marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. certain of these matters are included below in this discussion. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. however, management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably. natural gas royalty litigation marathon was served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and indian lessees violated the false claims act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. the first case, u.s. ex rel jack j. grynberg v. alaska pipeline co., et al. is primarily a gas measurement case, and the second case, u.s. ex rel harrold e. wright v. agip petroleum co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. these cases assert that false claims have been filed by lessees and that penalties, damages and interest total more than $25 billion. the department of justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including marathon. the matters are in the discovery phase and marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases. powder river basin arbitration the u.s. bureau of land management ( blm ) completed a multi-year review of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin in montana and wyoming. the agency record of decision ( rod ) was signed on april 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane development. plaintiff environmental and other groups filed four suits in may 2003 in the u.s. district court for the district of montana against the blm alleging the agency environmental impact review was not adequate. plaintiffs seek a court order enjoining coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin until blm conducts additional studies on the environmental impact. marathon has been allowed to intervene as a party in all four of the cases. as the lawsuits to delay energy development in the powder river basin progress through the courts, blm continues to process permits to drill under the rod. in january 2004, the court over protests of plaintiffs, transferred to the district court of wyoming, portions of two of the cases dealing with the sufficiency of the environmental impact review as to lands in wyoming. environmental proceedings the following is a summary of proceedings involving marathon that were pending or contemplated as of december 31, 2003, under federal and state environmental laws. except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management belief set forth in the first paragraph under item 3. legal proceedings above takes such matters into account. claims under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ( cercla ) and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. cercla is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. potentially responsible parties ( prps ) for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. liability is strict and can be joint and several. because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with cercla. projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. at december 31, 2003, marathon had been identified as a prp at a total of 9 cercla waste sites. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with all but one of these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000. marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under $4 million. 24 table of contents in addition, there are four sites where marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. there are also 125 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. of these sites, 16 were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland which has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 15 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 43 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site, 16 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site, 7 sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site, and one additional site has the potential to exceed $5 million. there are 27 sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs. there is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the michigan department of environmental quality at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near muskegon, michigan. during the next 10 to 20 years, marathon anticipates spending less than $7 million at this site. expenditures in 2003 were approximately $225,000, and expenditures in 2004 will be approximately $500,000. ongoing work at this site is subject to approval by the michigan department of environmental quality ( mdeq ), and a risk-based closure strategy is being developed and will be approved by the mdeq. map has had a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general office since 2002 concerning map self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its robinson, illinois refinery. map has had periodic discussions with illinois officials regarding this matter and more discussions are anticipated in 2004. the kentucky natural resources and environmental cabinet issued the map catlettsburg, kentucky refinery a notice of violation ( nov ) regarding the tank 845 rupture which occurred in november of 1999. the tank rupture caused the tank contents to be released onto the ground and adjoining retention area. map resolved this matter in 2003 for a civil penalty of $120,000 and the entering of an agreed administrative order. in 2000, the kentucky natural resources and environmental cabinet sent marathon ashland pipe line llc a nov seeking a civil penalty associated with a pipeline spill earlier that year in winchester, kentucky. map has settled this nov in the form of an agreed-to administrative order which was finalized and entered in january 2002 and required payment of a $170,000 penalty and reimbursement of past response costs up to $131,000. in july, 2002, marathon received a notice of enforcement from the state of texas for alleged excess air emissions from its yates gas plant and production operations on its kloh lease. the notices did not compute a penalty or fine for these pending enforcement actions; a tentative settlement for under $200,000 in civil penalties and a supplemental environmental project has been reached and awaits full commission approval. in may, 2003, marathon received a consolidated compliance order &amp; notice or potential penalty from the state of louisiana for alleged various air permit regulatory violations. this matter has been resolved in principle with the state for a civil penalty of under $150,000 and awaits formal closure with the state. during the third quarter of 2003, a map subsidiary, ohio river pipe line llc ( orpl ), entered into director final findings and orders with the ohio environmental protection agency ( oepa ). the oepa had alleged orpl violations of a stormwater permit and pollution prevention plan during construction of the cardinal products pipeline. the findings and orders required compliance with the permit, plan and other requirements, and payment of a $104,738 civil penalty. 25 table of contents item 4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders not applicable. part ii item 5. market for registrant common equity and related stockholder matters the principal market on which the company common stock is traded is the new york stock exchange. information concerning the high and low sales prices for the common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in selected quarterly financial data (unaudited) on page f-41. as of january 31, 2004, there were 61,404 registered holders of marathon common stock. the board of directors intends to declare and pay dividends on marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of marathon oil corporation, although it has no obligation under delaware law or the restated certificate of incorporation to do so. in determining its dividend policy with respect to marathon common stock, the board will rely on the financial statements of marathon. dividends on marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of marathon. on january 29, 2003, marathon amended the rights agreement, dated as september 28, 1999, as amended, between marathon and national city bank, as successor rights agent. the rights agreement was amended so that the rights to purchase series a junior preferred stock expired on january 31, 2003, more than six years earlier than initially specified in the plan. item 6. selected financial data see page f-49 through f-51. 26 table of contents item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marathon oil corporation ( marathon ) is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through its 62 percent owned subsidiary, marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ); and other energy related businesses. the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with items 1. and 2. business and properties, item 6. selected financial data and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page 52. e&amp;p segment income during 2003 was impacted by slightly lower oil-equivalent production down approximately 6 percent from 2002 levels. 2004 production is expected to decrease about 6 percent from 2003 levels mainly due to sales of non-core properties during 2003. marathon estimates its 2004 production will average approximately 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ( boepd ), excluding the impact of any additional acquisitions or dispositions. while production is expected to remain relatively flat through 2005, significant production growth is expected starting in 2006 from known projects in new core areas and recent exploration successes. total production is anticipated to grow by more than 3 percent on an average annual basis between 2003 and 2008. projected production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, supply and demand, regulatory constraints, reserve estimates, production decline rates for mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability and geological and operating considerations. these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been driven by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in economic activity and political developments in the world major oil and gas producing areas, including opec member 27 table of contents countries. any substantial decline in such prices could have a material adverse effect on marathon results of operations. a decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development. e&amp;p operations are subject to various hazards, including acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas. offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the gulf of mexico, the north sea, the u.k. atlantic margin, the celtic sea, offshore nova scotia and offshore west africa are also subject to severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. development of new production properties in countries outside the united states may require protracted negotiations with host governments and are frequently subject to political considerations, such as tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects. refining, marketing and transportation map refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, the upper great plains and southeastern united states. rm&amp;t segment income primarily reflects map income from operations which depends largely on the refining and wholesale marketing margin, refinery throughputs, retail marketing margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the profitability of its pipeline transportation operations. the refining and wholesale marketing margin is the difference between the wholesale prices of refined products sold and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks refined, the cost of purchased products and manufacturing costs. map is a purchaser of crude oil in order to satisfy throughput requirements of its refineries. as a result, its refining and wholesale marketing margin could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. the crack spread, which is a measure of the difference between spot market gasoline and distillate prices and spot market crude costs, is an industry indicator of refining margins. in addition to changes in the crack spread, map refining and wholesale marketing margin is impacted by the types of crude oil processed, the wholesale selling prices realized for all the products sold and the level of manufacturing costs. map processes significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances its competitive position in the industry as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. as crude oil production increases in the coming years, heavy, sour crude oil production growth is expected to outpace sweet crude oil production growth , which may translate into higher sour crude oil discounts going forward. over the last three years, approximately 60% of the crude oil throughput at map refineries has been sour crude oil. sales of asphalt increase during the highway construction season in map market area which is primarily in the second and third calendar quarters. the selling price of asphalt is dependant on the cost of crude oil, the price of alternative paving materials and the level of construction activity in both the private and public sectors. changes in manufacturing costs from period to period are primarily dependant on the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas. the refining and wholesale marketing margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products and raw materials. for additional information on price risk management, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page 52. additionally, the retail marketing gasoline and distillate margin, the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the wholesale cost of the refined products, including secondary transportation, plays an important part in downstream profitability. retail gasoline and distillate margins have been historically volatile, but tend to be countercyclical to the refining and wholesale marketing margin. factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross margin from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in the marketing areas. the profitability of map pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependant on the volumes shipped through the pipelines. the volume of crude oil that map transports is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by map crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of alternative transportation modes, and the refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the throughput of the refined products that map transports is directly affected by the production level of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by map refined product pipelines. in most of map markets, demand for gasoline peaks during 28 table of contents the summer driving season, which extends from may through september, and declines during the fall and winter months. the seasonal pattern for distillates is the reverse of this, helping to level overall movements on an annual basis. as with crude, other transportation alternatives and maintenance levels influence refined product movements. environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the clean air act, have imposed (and are expected to continue to impose) increasingly stringent and costly requirements on refining and marketing operations that may have an adverse effect on margins and financial condition. refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. other energy related businesses marathon operates other businesses that market and transport its own and third-party natural gas, crude oil and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. the profitability of these operations depends largely on commodity prices, volume deliveries, margins on resale gas, and demand. methanol spot pricing is very volatile largely because global methanol demand is only 30 millions tons and any one major unplanned shutdown or new addition can have a significant impact on the supply-demand balance. other energy related businesses ( oerb ) operations could be impacted by unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, product spills, inclement weather or availability of lng vessels. they are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. management discussion and analysis of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas marathon uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether or not certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties and the expected future taxable income available to realize the value of deferred tax assets, which are discussed further below, rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas. marathon estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. during 2003, approximately 35 percent of marathon total proved reserves were prepared, reviewed or validated by third-party petroleum engineering consultants. the results of these third-party reviews were consistent with marathon proved reserve estimates. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. estimates of proved reserves are subject to change, either positively and negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, economic and political conditions change. during 2003, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 40 million boe as a result of 97 million boe in positive revisions which were partially offset by 57 million boe in negative revisions. 29 table of contents proved developed reserves represented 70 percent of total proved reserves as of december 31, 2003, as compared to 78 percent as of december 31, 2002. the decrease primarily reflects the disposition of the yates field. of the just over 300 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2003, only 10 percent have been included as proved reserves for more than two years. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, including marathon proportionate share of equity investees costs incurred, were $780 million, $404 million, and $365 million. as of december 31, 2003, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2004 through 2006 are projected to be $324 million, $149 million, and $126 million. expected future cash flows generated by certain oil and gas producing properties marathon must estimate the expected future cash flows to be generated by its oil and gas producing properties to evaluate the possible need to impair the carrying value of those properties. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which is called an asset group . an impairment of any one of marathon five largest producing property asset groups could have a material impact on the presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. those asset groups the alba field offshore equatorial guinea, the coal bed natural gas properties of the powder river basin, the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom, petronius development in the gulf of mexico, and potanay field in the russian federation comprise approximately 49 percent of marathon total proved oil and gas reserves. the expected future cash flows from these asset groups require assumptions about matters such as the prevailing level of future oil and gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of oil and gas, expected field performance and the political environment in the host country. long-lived asset groups held and used in operations must be impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value. recoverability of the carrying values is determined by comparison with the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated by those groups. as of december 31, 2003, no impairment in the value of the alba field, powder river basin, brae area complex, petronius development or the potanay field was indicated. expected future taxable income marathon must estimate its expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of its deferred income tax assets. as of december 31, 2003, marathon reported net deferred tax assets of $1.155 billion, which represented gross assets of $1.731 billion net of valuation allowances of $576 million. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in marathon internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. in determining its overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, marathon considers proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves related to its existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in the judgment of marathon management, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance, marathon considers the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. additionally, marathon must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if management has the ability to implement these strategies and the expectation of implementing these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to marathon relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered annually to give effect to changes in marathon portfolio of producing properties and in its tax profile. marathon deferred tax assets include $450 million relating to norwegian net operating loss carryforwards ( nols ). marathon has established a valuation allowance of $420 million against these nols. currently, marathon generates income from the heimdal and vale fields in the norwegian north sea. marathon acquired 30 table of contents additional interests in norway in each of the last three years. these interests currently have no proved reserves and generate no income, although some interests hold undeveloped discoveries. to the extent that these interests demonstrate the capability to generate future taxable income, marathon may be able to release some or all of its $420 million valuation allowance in future periods. net realizable value of receivables from united states steel as described further in management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on page 43, marathon remains obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. as of december 31, 2003, marathon has reported receivables from united states steel of $613 million, representing the amount of principal and accrued interest on marathon debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment. marathon must assess the realizability of these receivables, based on its expectations of united states steel ability to satisfy its obligations. to make this assessment, marathon must rely on public information about united states steel. as of december 31, 2003, marathon has judged the entire receivable to be realizable. marathon may continue to be exposed to the risk of nonpayment by united states steel on a significant portion of this receivable until december 31, 2011. of the $613 million, $469 million, or 77 percent, relates to industrial revenue bonds that are due in 2011 or later. the financial matters agreement between marathon and united states steel provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, which is december 31, 2011, united states steel will provide for marathon discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. as of december 31, 2003, marathon cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (which includes debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment) was 33 percent. the assessment of marathon liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by expectations concerning united states steel ability to satisfy its obligations. if the debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment were excluded from the computation, marathon cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of december 31, 2003 would have been approximately 28 percent. on the other hand, if the receivable from united states steel had been written off as unrealizable, the cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of december 31, 2003 would have been approximately 34 percent. (if united states steel were unable to satisfy its obligations, other adjustments in addition to the write-off of the receivable may be necessary.) net realizable value of inventories generally accepted accounting principles require that inventories be carried at lower of cost or market. accordingly, when the cost basis of marathon inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products exceed market value, marathon establishes an inventory market valuation ( imv ) reserve to reduce the cost basis of its inventories to net realizable value. adjustments to the imv reserve result in noncash charges or credits to income from operations. when marathon oil company was acquired in march 1982, prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were at historically high levels. in applying the purchase method of accounting, inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were revalued by reference to current prices at the time of acquisition. this became the new lifo cost basis of the inventories. when marathon acquired the crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories associated with ashland rm&amp;t operations on january 1, 1998, marathon established a new lifo cost basis for those inventories. the acquisition cost of these inventories lowered the overall average cost of the combined rm&amp;t inventories. as a result, the price threshold at which an imv reserve will be recorded was also lowered. since the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products do not correlate perfectly, there is no absolute price threshold below which an imv adjustment will be recognized. however, generally, marathon will establish an imv reserve when crude oil prices fall below $20 per barrel. as of december 31, 2003, with the wti spotprice at $32.47 per barrel, no imv reserve was needed. 31 table of contents contingent liabilities marathon accrues contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. marathon in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies on page 45. pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for these benefit obligations involves assumptions related to: discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected long-term rates of return on plan assets rate of future increases in compensation levels health care cost projections marathon develops its demographics and utilizes the work of outside actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. in determining the discount rate, marathon reviews market yields on high-quality corporate debt. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans, targeted at 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities, past performance and other factors. compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. marathon reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends in establishing health care cost trend rates. of the assumptions used to measure the december 31, 2003 obligations and estimated 2004 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit costs reported for the plans. a .25% basis point decrease in the discount rate of 6.25% for domestic and 5.40% for international would increase pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately $12 million and $3 million, respectively. estimated fair value of asset retirement obligations the fair value of an asset retirement obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. for marathon, asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas producing facilities. asset retirement obligations include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of production platforms, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. estimates of these costs are developed for each property based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including future retirement costs, future recoverable quantities of oil and gas, future inflation rates, the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. marathon estimation of asset retirement obligations and retirement dates is primarily performed by in-house engineers in consultation with in-house legal and environmental experts. due to the inherent uncertainties in asset retirement obligations and retirement dates, these estimates are subject to potentially substantial changes, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, legal, environmental, economic and technological conditions change. while assets such as refineries, crude oil and product pipelines, and marketing assets have asset retirement obligations, certain of those obligations are not recognized since the fair value cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the settlement date of the obligation. marathon estimates of the ultimate asset retirement obligations are based on estimates in current dollars, inflated to the estimated date of retirement by an annual inflation factor. sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects of a hypothetical 1% increase in the inflation rate would have resulted in an approximately $28 million increase in the fair value of the asset retirement obligations at december 31, 2003, and an approximately $5 million decrease in 2003 income from operations. 32 table of contents estimated fair value of non-exchange traded derivative contracts marathon fairly values all derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used to manage risk throughout marathon different businesses. these risks relate to commodities, interest rates and to a lesser extent our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. marathon uses derivative instruments that are exchange traded and non-exchange traded. non-exchange traded instruments are referred to as over-the-counter ( otc ) instruments. the fair value of exchange traded instruments is based on existing market quotes derived from major exchanges such as the new york merchantile exchange. the fair value for otc instruments such as options and swap agreements is developed through the use of option-pricing models or third party market quotes. the option-pricing models incorporate assumptions related to market volatility, current market price, strike price, interest rates and time value. marathon utilizes purchased software option-pricing tools, similar to the black-scholes model, to fairly value its options related to commodity-based risks. otc swap agreements are used to manage our exposure to interest rates. marathon obtains third party dealer quotes to mark-to-market these financial instruments. in addition, marathon has developed an internal pricing model which takes into consideration the specific contract terms and the forward market for interest rates. this tool is used to test the reasonableness of the third party dealer quotes associated with the otc swap agreements. marathon also fairly values two natural gas long term delivery commitment contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and recognizes the change in fair value of those contracts on a quarterly basis within income from operations. the fair value is derived from published market data such as the heren report that captures the market-based natural gas activity in the united kingdom. currently, an 18 month forward pricing curve is utilized as this represents approximately 90% of the market liquidity in that region. for additional information on market risk sensitivity, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page 52. 33 table of contents management discussion and analysis of income and operations revenues for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 e&amp;p $ 3,990 $ 3,711 $ 4,245 rm&amp;t 34,514 26,399 27,247 oerb 3,209 2,122 2,062 segment

both revenues and costs and expenses: consumer excise taxes on petroleum products and merchandise $ 4,285 $ 4,250 $ 4,404 matching crude oil and refined product buy/sell transactions settled in cash: e&amp;p $ 222 $ 289 $ 454 rm&amp;t 6,936 4,191 3,797 total buy/sell transactions $ 7,158 $ 4,480 $ 4,251 e&amp;p segment revenues increased by $279 million in 2003 from 2002 and decreased by $534 million in 2002 from 2001. the 2003 increase was primarily due to higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices. this increase was partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes. the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower worldwide natural gas prices and lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes, partially offset by higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices. derivative gains (losses) totaled $(176) million in 2003, compared to $52 million in 2002 and $85 million in 2001. derivatives included losses of $66 million in 2003, compared to gains of $18 million in 2002, related to long-term gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and marked-to-market. rm&amp;t segment revenues increased by $8.115 billion in 2003 from 2002 and decreased by $848 million in 2002 from 2001. the 2003 increase primarily reflected higher refined product selling prices and volumes and increased matching crude oil buy/sell transaction volumes and prices. the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower refined product prices. oerb segment revenues increased by $1.087 billion in 2003 from 2002 and $60 million in 2002 from 2001. the increase in 2003 is a result of higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices and increased natural gas and crude oil marketing activity. the increase in 2002 reflected a favorable effect from increased natural gas and crude oil marketing activity partially offset by lower natural gas prices. derivative gains (losses) totaled $19 million in 2003, compared to $(8) million in 2002 and $(29) million in 2001. for additional information on segment results, see discussion on income from operations on page 36. income from equity method investments decreased by $108 million in 2003 and increased by $19 million in 2002 from 2001. the decrease in 2003 is due to a $124 million loss on the dissolution of mkm partners l.p., partially offset by increased earnings of other equity method investments due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons prices. for further discussion of the dissolution of mkm partners l.p., see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. the increase in 2002 is primarily the result of increased earnings in other equity method investments due to higher liquid hydrocarbons prices. net gains on disposal of assets increased by $99 million in 2003 from 2002 and $23 million in 2002 from 2001. during 2003, marathon sold its interest in clam petroleum b.v., interests in several pipeline companies, yates field and gathering system, ssa stores primarily in florida, south carolina, north carolina and georgia, and certain fields in the big horn basin of wyoming. results from 2002 include the sale of various ssa stores and the sale of san juan basin assets. results from 2001 include the sale of various ssa stores and various domestic producing properties. gain (loss) on ownership change in map reflects the effects of contributions to map of certain environmental capital expenditures and leased property acquisitions funded by marathon and ashland. in accordance with map limited liability company agreement, in certain instances, environmental capital 34 table of contents expenditures and acquisitions of leased properties are funded by the original contributor of the assets, but no change in ownership interest may result from these contributions. an excess of ashland funded improvements over marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of marathon funded improvements over ashland funded improvements results in a net loss. cost of revenues increased by $8.718 billion in 2003 from 2002 and $367 million in 2002 from 2001. the increases in the oerb segment were primarily a result of higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon costs. the increases in the rm&amp;t segment primarily reflected higher acquisition costs for crude oil, refined products, refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $107 million in 2003 from 2002 and $125 million in 2002 from 2001. the increase in 2003 was primarily a result of increased employee benefits (caused by increased pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and a decrease in realized returns on plan assets) and other employee related costs. also, marathon changed assumptions in the health care cost trend rate from 7.5% to 10%, resulting in higher retiree health care costs. additionally, during 2003, marathon recorded a charge of $24 million related to organizational and business process changes. the increase in 2002 primarily reflected increased employee related costs. inventory market valuation reserve is established to reduce the cost basis of inventories to current market value. the 2002 results of operations include credits to income from operations of $71 million, reversing the imv reserve at december 31, 2001. for additional information on this adjustment, see management discussion and analysis of critical accounting estimates net realizable value of inventories on page 31. net interest and other financial costs decreased by $82 million in 2003 from 2002, following an increase of $96 million in 2002 from 2001. the decrease in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased long-term construction projects, the favorable effect of interest rate swaps, the favorable effect of interest on tax deficiencies and increased interest income on investments. the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher average debt levels resulting from acquisitions and the separation. additionally, included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency gains of $13 million and $8 million for 2003 and 2002 and losses of $5 million for 2001. loss from early extinguishment of debt in 2002 was attributable to the retirement of $337 million aggregate principal amount of debt, resulting in a loss of $53 million. as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no. 145 rescission of fasb statements no. 4, 44, and 64, amendment of fasb statement no. 13, and technical corrections ( sfas no. 145 ), the loss from early extinguishment of debt that was previously reported as an extraordinary item (net of taxes of $20 million) has been reclassified into income before income taxes. the adoption of sfas no. 145 had no impact on net income for 2002. minority interest in income of map , which represents ashland 38 percent ownership interest, increased by $129 million in 2003 from 2002, following a decrease of $531 million in 2002 from 2001. map income was higher in 2003 compared to 2002 as discussed below in the rm&amp;t segment. map income was significantly lower in 2002 compared to 2001 as discussed below in the rm&amp;t segment. provision for income taxes increased by $215 million in 2003 from 2002, following a decrease of $458 million in 2002 from 2001, primarily due to $720 million increase and $1.356 billion decrease in income before income taxes. the effective tax rate for 2003 was 36.6% compared to 42.1% and 37.1% for 2002 and 2001. the higher rate in 2002 was due to the united kingdom enactment of a supplementary 10 percent tax on profits from the north sea oil and gas production, retroactively effective to april 17, 2002. in 2002, marathon recognized a one-time noncash deferred tax adjustment of $61 million as a result of the rate increase. the following is an analysis of the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2003 2002 2001 statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % effects of foreign operations (a) (0.4 ) 5.6 (0.7 ) state and local income taxes after federal income tax effects 2.2 3.9 3.0 other federal tax effects (0.2 ) (2.4 ) (0.2 ) effective tax rate 36.6 % 42.1 % 37.1 % (a) the deferred tax effect related to the enactment of a supplemental tax in the u.k. increased the effective tax rate 7.0 percent in 2002. 35 table of contents discontinued operations in 2003 primarily relates to marathon e&amp;p operations in western canada, which were sold in 2003 for a gain of $278 million, including a tax benefit of $8 million. also, included in 2003 results is an $8 million adjustment to a tax liability due to united states steel corporation. results for 2002 and 2001 have been restated to reflect the western canadian operations as discontinued. results for 2001 also include the net loss attributed to steel stock, adjusted for certain corporate administrative expenses and interest expense (net of income tax effects), and the loss on disposition of united states steel corporation, which is the excess of the net investment in united states steel over the aggregate fair market value of the outstanding shares of the steel stock at the time of the separation. cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $4 million, net of a tax provision of $4 million, in 2003 represents the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no. 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations ( sfas no. 143 ), in which marathon recognized in income the cumulative effect of recording the fair value of asset retirement obligations. the $13 million gain, net of a tax provision of $7 million, in 2002 represents the adoption of subsequently issued interpretations by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) of statement of financial accounting standards no. 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ( sfas no. 133 ) in which marathon must recognize in income the effect of changes in the fair value of two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the united kingdom. the $8 million loss, net of a tax benefit of $5 million, in 2001 was an unfavorable transition adjustment related to the initial adoption of sfas no. 133. net income increased by $805 million in 2003 from 2002 and by $359 million in 2002 from 2001, primarily reflecting the factors discussed above. income from operations for each of the last three years is summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 e&amp;p domestic $ 1,128 $

million in 2003 from 2002 following a decrease of $435 million in 2002 from 2001. the increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices, lower dry well expense and a $25 million favorable contract settlement, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes and derivative losses. the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower volumes, lower derivative gains and higher dry well expense, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon prices. derivative gains (losses) totaled $(91) million in 2003, compared to $32 million in 2002 and $85 million in 2001. marathon domestic average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $27.02 per barrel ( bbl ) in 2003, compared with $22.35 per bbl in 2002 and $20.81 per bbl in 2001. average gas prices were $4.53 per thousand cubic feet ( mcf ) excluding derivative activity in 2003, compared with $2.87 per mcf in 2002 and $3.69 per mcf in 2001. domestic net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 11 percent to 111 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ) in 2003, as a result of natural declines mainly in the gulf of mexico and dispositions. net natural gas production averaged 732 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ), down 2 percent from 2002. domestic net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 8 percent to 125 mbpd in 2002, as a result of natural declines principally in the gulf of mexico and dispositions. net natural gas production averaged 745 mmcfd, down 6 percent from 2001. international e&amp;p income increased by $8 million in 2003 from 2002 and $122 million in 2002 from 2001. the increase in 2003 was a result of higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices and higher liquid hydrocarbon volumes partially offset by lower natural gas volumes and derivative losses. the increase in 2002 was a result of higher production volumes and higher derivative gains partially offset by lower natural gas prices. derivative gains (losses) totaled $(85) million in 2003, compared to $20 million in 2002 and $ million in 2001. derivatives included losses of $66 million in 2003, compared to gains of $18 million in 2002, related to long-term gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and marked-to-market. marathon international average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $26.24 per bbl in 2003, compared with $23.85 per bbl and $23.74 per bbl in 2002 and 2001. average gas prices were $2.80 per mcf excluding derivative activity in 2003, compared with $2.35 per mcf and $2.83 per mcf in 2002 and 2001. international net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 2 percent to 80 mbpd in 2003 primarily due to the acquisition of kmoc, partially offset by lower production in the u.k. net natural gas production averaged 364 mmcfd, down 5 percent from 2002, primarily from lower production in ireland and the disposition of marathon interest in clam petroleum b.v. this decrease was partially offset by increased production in equatorial guinea. international net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 26 percent to 78 mbpd in 2002 primarily due to the acquisition of interests in equatorial guinea and increased production in the u.k. net natural gas production averaged 382 mmcfd, up 7 percent from 2001, primarily due to higher production in equatorial guinea partially offset by lower production in the u.k. rm&amp;t segment income increased by $414 million in 2003 from 2002 following a decrease of $1.558 billion in 2002 from 2001. the 2003 increase was primarily due to an improved refining and wholesale marketing margin, as well as a higher gasoline and distillate retail gross margin partially offset by higher administrative expenses. the refining and wholesale marketing margin in 2003 averaged 6.0 cents per gallon, versus 2002 level of 3.9 cents. the gasoline and distillate gross margin for its retail business, was 12.3 cents per gallon in 2003, as compared to 10.1 cents per gallon in 2002. the higher administrative expenses were due primarily to higher employee related costs. in 2002, the refining and wholesale marketing margin was severely compressed as crude oil costs increased while average refined product prices decreased. the refining and wholesale marketing margin in 2002 averaged 3.9 cents per gallon, versus 2001 level of 11.7 cents. derivative losses, which are included in the refining and wholesale marketing margin, were $162 million in 2003 as compared to losses of $124 million and gains of $210 million in 2002 and 2001. these derivative losses were generally incurred to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases and to protect carrying values of excess inventories. gains on the sale of ssa stores included in segment income were $8 million, $37 million, and $23 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001. 38 table of contents oerb segment income decreased by $5 million in 2003 from 2002 and increased by $16 million in 2002 from 2001. the 2003 results include a gain of $34 million on the sale of marathon interest in two refined product pipeline companies and earnings of $30 million from marathon equity investment in the equatorial guinea methanol plant, which were offset by an impairment charge of $22 million on an equity method investment and a loss of $17 million on the termination of two tanker operating leases. the increase in 2002 reflected a favorable effect of $26 million from increased margins in gas marketing activities and mark-to-market valuation changes in associated derivatives and earnings of $11 million from marathon equity investment in the equatorial guinea methanol plant, partially offset by predevelopment costs associated with emerging integrated gas projects. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity financial condition current assets increased $1.561 billion from year-end 2002, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and receivables. the increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to approximately $1.256 billion in non-core asset sales in 2003. the increase in receivables was mainly due to higher year-end commodity prices. current liabilities increased $548 million from year-end 2002, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, long-term debt due within one year and payroll and benefits payable, partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes and interest. the increase in accounts payable was due to higher priced year-end crude purchases at map. the increase in payroll and benefits payable is primarily due to liabilities related to equity based compensation as a result of an increase in marathon stock price. investments and long-term receivables decreased $311 million from year-end 2002, primarily due to the dissolution of mkm partners l.p. and the sale of interest in clam petroleum b.v. in 2003. net property, plant and equipment increased $440 million from year-end 2002. the increase in e&amp;p international is due to the construction of the alba field phase 2a expansion project in equatorial guinea and the acquisition of kmoc, partially offset by the disposition of properties in western canada. the increase in rm&amp;t is primarily due to the catlettsburg, kentucky refinery repositioning project and construction of the cardinal products pipeline, partially offset by sales of ssa stores. the increase in oerb is primarily due to the purchase of a 30% interest in two lng tankers which marathon previously leased and project development costs associated with phase 3 in equatorial guinea. net property, plant and equipment for each of the last two years is summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2003 2002 e&amp;p domestic $ 2,608 $ 2,720 international 3,351 3,186 total e&amp;p 5,959 5,906 rm&amp;t 4,492 4,234 oerb 181 67 corporate 198 183 total $ 10,830 $ 10,390 goodwill decreased $18 million from year-end 2002, primarily due to the disposition of properties in western canada. long-term debt at december 31, 2003 was $4.085 billion, a decrease of $325 million from year-end 2002. see liquidity and capital resources on page 41, for further discussions. asset retirement obligations increased $167 million from year-end 2002 primarily due to the adoption of sfas no. 143 on january 1, 2003 and the acquisition of kmoc, partially offset by disposition of properties in western canada. 39 table of contents cash flows net cash provided from operating activities (for continuing operations) totaled $2.678 billion in 2003, compared with $2.336 billion in 2002 and $2.749 billion in 2001. the increase in 2003 mainly reflects the effects of higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons prices and a higher refining and wholesale marketing margin. additionally in 2003, map made cash contributions to its pension plans of $89 million. the decrease in 2002 mainly reflects the effects of lower refined product margins and lower prices for natural gas. net cash provided from operating activities (for discontinued operations) totaled $83 million in 2003, compared with $69 million in 2002 and $887 million in 2001. this is primarily related to marathon e&amp;p operations in western canada sold in 2003. also included in 2001 is the business of united states steel. capital expenditures for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 e&amp;p (a) domestic $ 342 $ 416 $ 537 international 629 403 294 total e&amp;p 971 819 831 rm&amp;t 772 621 591 oerb 133 49 4 corporate 16 31 107 total $ 1,892 $ 1,520 $ 1,533 (a) amounts exclude the acquisitions of kmoc in 2003, the equatorial guinea interests in 2002 and pennaco in 2001. capital expenditures in 2003 totaled $1.892 billion compared with $1.520 billion and $1.533 billion in 2002 and 2001, excluding the acquisitions of kmoc in 2003, equatorial guinea interests in 2002 and pennaco in 2001. the $372 million increase in 2003 mainly reflected increased spending in the rm&amp;t segment at the catlettsburg refinery and on the cardinal products pipeline and in the e&amp;p segment in west africa and norway. the increase in oerb is due to the purchase of 30% interest in two lng tankers which marathon previously leased and project development costs associated with phase 3 in equatorial guinea. the $13 million decrease in 2002 mainly reflected decreased spending in the e&amp;p segment offset by increased spending in the rm&amp;t segment. the decrease in the e&amp;p segment was primarily due to the drilling of fewer gas wells in the united states in 2002 partially offset by higher capital expenditures for completion of a pipeline in gabon, for a pipeline construction contract in ireland and for development expenditures in equatorial guinea. the increase in the rm&amp;t segment in 2002 was attributable to increased spending on the multi-year integrated investment program at map catlettsburg refinery and construction of the cardinal products pipeline in 2002, partially offset by lower capital expenditures for ssa retail outlets and completion of the garyville coker construction in 2001. the decrease in corporate in 2002 was primarily due to the implementation of sap financial and operations software in 2001. acquisitions included cash payments of $252 million in 2003 for the acquisition of kmoc, $1.160 billion in 2002 for the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests and $506 million in 2001 for the acquisition of pennaco. for further discussion of acquisitions, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. cash from disposal of assets was $1.256 billion, including the disposal of discontinued operations, in 2003, compared with $146 million in 2002 and $83 million in 2001. in 2003, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of marathon e&amp;p properties in western canada, yates field and gathering system, interest in clam petroleum b.v., ssa stores, interest in several pipeline companies and certain fields in the big horn basin of wyoming. in 2002, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of various ssa stores and the sale of san juan basin assets. in 2001, proceeds were primarily from the sale of certain canadian assets, ssa stores, and various domestic producing properties. net cash used in financing activities totaled $888 million in 2003, compared with net cash provided of $88 million in 2002 and net cash used of $1.290 billion in 2001. the decrease was due to activity in 2002 primarily associated with financing the acquisitions of equatorial guinea interests of $1.160 billion. this was partially offset by the $295 million repayment of preferred securities in 2002 that became redeemable or were converted to a right to receive cash upon the separation. in early january 2002, marathon paid $185 million to retire the 6.75% convertible quarterly income preferred securities and $110 million to retire the 6.50% cumulative convertible preferred stock. additionally, distributions to the minority shareholder of map were $262 million in 2003, 40 table of contents compared to $176 million and $577 million in 2002 and 2001. the cash used in 2001 primarily reflects distributions to the minority shareholder of map, dividends paid and the redemption of the 8.75 percent cumulative monthly income preferred shares. derivative instruments see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page 52, for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. dividends to stockholders on january 25, 2004, the marathon board of directors declared a dividend of 25 cents per share on marathon common stock, payable march 10, 2004, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 18, 2004. liquidity and capital resources marathon main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. marathon ability to access the debt capital market is supported by its investment grade credit ratings. because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to marathon, including internally generated cash flow, marathon management believes that its short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities for the years 2004, 2005, and 2006, and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. marathon senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor corporation, moody investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+, baa1, and bbb+, respectively. marathon has a committed $1.354 billion long-term revolving credit facility that terminates in november 2005 and a committed $575 million 364-day revolving credit facility that terminates in november 2004. at december 31, 2003, there were no borrowings against these facilities. at december 31, 2003, marathon had no commercial paper outstanding under the u.s. commercial paper program that is backed by the long-term revolving credit facility. additionally, marathon has other uncommitted short-term lines of credit totaling $200 million, of which no amounts were drawn at december 31, 2003. map has a $190 million revolving credit agreement with ashland that expires in march 2004 and is expected to be renewed until march 2005. as of december 31, 2003, map did not have any borrowings against this facility. in 2002, marathon filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission registering $2.7 billion aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities and/or other securities, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for other equity or debt securities. as of december 31, 2003, no securities had been offered under this shelf registration statement. marathon held cash and cash equivalents of $1.396 billion at december 31, 2003, compared to $488 million at december 31, 2002. the increase primarily reflects proceeds from asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2003. marathon expects to utilize a substantial portion of this cash to fund operations, including its capital and investment program, and to repay debt in 2004. marathon cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total-debt-minus-cash to total-debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 33 percent at december 31, 2003, compared to 45 percent at year-end 2002. this includes approximately $605 million of debt that is serviced by united states steel. 41 table of contents the table below provides aggregated information on marathon obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31, 2003:

that marathon remains primarily liable. (b) the majority of 2004 contractual obligations to purchase crude oil, refinery feedstock and refined products relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of the year. (c) marathon has acquired the right to deliver to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal 58 bcf of natural gas per year. the agreement primary term ends in 2021. pursuant to this agreement, marathon has also bound itself to a commitment to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the lng re-gasification terminal. (d) services and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (e) marathon is a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with alliance pipeline. this agreement is used by alliance pipeline to secure its financing. this arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of marathon guarantee. (f) commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs within contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are subject to immediate expense, such as geological and geophysical costs. (g) marathon has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other post retirement benefits including medical and life insurance. marathon has estimated projected funding through 2013 with the exception of the pension plan for employees in ireland where only 2004 information was included. (h) includes $733 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. for additional information, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel on page 44. contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded from the above table. these include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors. marathon management opinion concerning liquidity and marathon ability to avail itself in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. to the extent that this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include the performance of marathon (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in 42 table of contents particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of marathon outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. off balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact marathon liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of marathon business purposes, marathon is not dependent on these arrangements to maintain its liquidity and capital resources; nor is management aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. marathon has provided various forms of guarantees to unconsolidated affiliates, united states steel and certain lease contracts. these arrangements are described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. marathon is a party to agreements that would require marathon to purchase, under certain circumstances, the interests in map and in pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ) not currently owned. these put/call agreements are described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. nonrecourse indebtedness of investees certain equity investees of marathon have incurred indebtedness that marathon does not support through guarantees or otherwise. if marathon were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata basis, its share would have been approximately $307 million as of december 31, 2003. of this amount, $173 million relates to ptc. if any of these equity investees default, marathon has no obligation to support the debt. marathon partner in ptc has guaranteed $157 million of the total ptc debt. obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on december 31, 2001, marathon disposed of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel to holders of its usx u. s. steel group class of common stock ( steel stock ) in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis (the separation ). marathon remains obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. united states steel obligations to marathon are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. if united states steel fails to satisfy these obligations, marathon would become responsible for repayment. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases. as of december 31, 2003, marathon has identified the following obligations totaling $699 million that have been assumed by united states steel: $470 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $8 million at december 31, 2003. $76 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2003. $59 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel clairton cokemaking facility, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2003. $72 million of operating lease obligations, of which $54 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee of united states steel $14 million contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent owned joint venture pro-tec coating company. 43 table of contents a guarantee of all obligations of united states steel as general partner of clairton 1314b partnership, l.p. to the limited partners. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. for further discussion of the clairton 1314b guarantee, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $699 million, obligations of $613 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on marathon consolidated balance sheet (current portion $20 million; long-term portion $593 million). the remaining $86 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. the table below provides aggregated information on the portion of marathon obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by united states steel as of december 31, 2003: summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel (dollars in millions) total 2004 2005- 2006 2007- 2008 later years contractual obligations assumed by united states steel long-term debt $ 470 $ $ $ $ 470 sale-leaseback financing (includes imputed interest) 107 11 22 31 43 capital lease obligations 84 13 13 19 39 operating lease obligations 18 5 10 3 operating lease obligations under sublease 54 12 11 10 21 total contractual obligations assumed by united states steel $ 733 $ 41 $ 56 $ 63 $ 573 each of marathon and united states steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during taxable periods ended on or before december 31, 2001, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for those periods. marathon and united states steel have entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended on or before december 31, 2001. the agreement includes indemnification provisions to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party. in 2003, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement, marathon paid $16 million to united states steel in connection with the settlement with the internal revenue service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of usx corporation for the years 1992 through 1994. united states steel reported in its form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2003, that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. however, united states steel management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. during periods of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the u.s. economy, united states steel believes that it can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending, sale of non-strategic assets and other cash conservation measures. transactions with related parties marathon owns a combined 63.3% working interest in the alba field. marathon owns a net 52.2% interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant through an equity method investee, alba plant llc. additionally, marathon owns a 45% net interest in an onshore methanol production plant through an equity method investee, atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ). marathon sells its marketed natural gas from the alba field to alba plant llc and ampco. ampco uses the natural gas to manufacture methanol and sells the methanol through ampco marketing llc. map related party sales to its 50% equity method investee, ptc, consists primarily of refined petroleum products which accounted for approximately 2% of its total sales revenue for 2003. ptc is the largest travel center network in the united states and operates 257 travel centers nationwide. map also sells refined petroleum products consisting mainly of petrochemicals, base lube oils, and asphalt to ashland which owns a 38% interest in map. map sales to ashland accounted for approximately 1% of its total sales revenue for 2003. management believes that these transactions were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. 44 table of contents management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies marathon has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of marathon products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. marathon believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether or not it is engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. marathon environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were (a) : (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 capital $ 331 $ 128 $ 90 compliance operating &amp; maintenance 243 205 213 remediation (b) 44 45 22 total $ 618 $ 378 $ 325 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines and include 100 percent of map. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. marathon environmental capital expenditures accounted for 17 percent of total capital expenditures in 2003, eight percent in 2002, and six percent in 2001. marathon accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. marathon has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party ( prp ) at nine waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ( cercla ) as of december 31, 2003. in addition, there are 4 sites where marathon has received information requests or other indications that marathon may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. at many of these sites, marathon is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well as marathon share thereof, is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies. there are also 125 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. of these sites, 16 were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland for which ashland has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase marathon environmental costs, may arise in the future. marathon intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. marathon environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $415 million or 20% of capital expenditures in 2004. predictions beyond 2004 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based upon currently identified projects, marathon anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $425 million in 2005; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. 45 table of contents new tier 2 gasoline and on-road diesel fuel rules require substantially reduced sulfur levels for gasoline and diesel starting in 2004 and 2006, respectively. the combined capital costs to achieve compliance with the gasoline and diesel regulations could amount to approximately $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006 and includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. this is a forward-looking statement. costs incurred through december 31, 2003, were approximately $205 million. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits, completion of project detailed engineering, and project construction and logistical considerations. map has had a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general office since 2002 concerning map self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its robinson, illinois refinery. map has had periodic discussions with illinois officials regarding this matter and more discussions are anticipated in 2004. during 2001, map entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act ( caa ) and other violations with the u. s. environmental protection agency covering all of map refineries. the settlement committed map to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to map refineries over approximately an eight-year period. the total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately $330 million over the eight-year period, with about $170 million incurred through december 31, 2003. the impact of the settlement on ongoing operating expenses is expected to be immaterial. in addition, map has nearly completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations, at a cost of $9 million. map believes that this settlement will provide map with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions. other contingencies marathon is a defendant along with many other refining companies in over forty recently filed cases in thirteen states alleging methyl tertiary-butyl ether (mtbe) contamination in groundwater. the plaintiffs generally are water providers or governmental authorities and they allege that refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing mtbe are liable for manufacturing a defective product and that owners and operators of retail gasoline sites have allowed mtbe to be discharged into the groundwater. several of these lawsuits allege contamination that is outside of marathon marketing area. a few of the cases seek approval as class actions. many of the cases seek punitive damages or treble damages under a variety of statutes and theories. marathon has stopped producing mtbe at its refineries. the potential impact of these recent cases and future potential similar cases is uncertain. marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases. marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to marathon. however, management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to marathon. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources . 46 table of contents outlook realignment of business segments in january 2004, marathon changed its business segments to fully reflect all the operations of the integrated gas strategy within a single segment. in the first quarter of 2004, marathon will realign its segment reporting and introduce a new business segment, integrated gas. this segment will initially include marathon alaska lng operations, equatorial guinea methanol operations, and natural gas marketing and transportation activities, along with expenses related to the continued development of an integrated gas business. crude oil marketing and transportation activities, previously reported in other energy related businesses, will be reported in the exploration and production segment. refined product transportation activities not included in map, also previously reported in other energy related businesses, will be reported in the refining, marketing and transportation segment. the following represents unaudited information for the realigned operating segment for the previous three years: (in

has approved a capital, investment and exploration expenditure budget of approximately $2.26 billion for 2004. the primary focus of the 2004 budget is to find additional oil and gas reserves, develop existing fields, strengthen rm&amp;t assets and continue implementation of the integrated gas strategy through phase 3 in equatorial guinea. the budget includes worldwide production capital spending of $810 million primarily in equatorial guinea, russia, norway and the gulf of mexico. the worldwide exploration and exploitation budget of $302 million includes plans to drill 11 significant exploration wells in angola, equatorial guinea, norway, the gulf of mexico and nova scotia. exploitation activities will focus on projects primarily in the united states. the budget includes $788 million for rm&amp;t projects, primarily for refinery upgrade projects for the production of low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel and the detroit refinery expansion. the integrated gas budget of $263 million is primarily for the development of the lng project on bioko island in equatorial guinea. the remaining $96 million balance is designated for corporate activities and capitalized interest. exploration and production the outlook regarding marathon upstream revenues and income is largely dependent upon future prices and volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been affected by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in worldwide economic activity and political developments in the world major oil and gas producing and consuming areas. any significant decline in prices could have a material adverse effect on marathon results of operations. a prolonged decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of crude oil and natural gas reserves that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development. marathon estimates its 2004 and 2005 production will average 365,000 boepd, excluding the effect of any acquisitions or dispositions. marathon replaced 124 percent of production, excluding dispositions, during 2003. also during the year, the company divested non-core upstream assets with 274 million boe of proved reserves. excluding acquisitions and dispositions, marathon replaced approximately 76 percent of production. at year end, marathon had proved reserves of 1.042 billion boe. exploration major exploration activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include: angola, where marathon recently participated in the drilling of the venus exploration well on block 31 and the canela well on block 32. plans are to participate in two to four additional exploration wells in this area during 2004; norway, where marathon has interests in twelve licenses in the norwegian sector of the north sea and plans to drill two exploration wells during 2004, one of which is anticipated to be in the alvheim area; gulf of mexico, where marathon plans to participate in two deepwater and two shelf exploration wells during 2004; equatorial guinea, where marathon is currently evaluating the results of recent drilling in the deep luba prospect, which will test for potential resources under the alba field and plans to drill one or two additional exploration wells in 2004; eastern canada, where marathon plans to drill one exploration well on the annapolis lease during 2004. production in equatorial guinea, marathon phase 2a expansion project came on-stream during the fourth quarter. this project began producing less than 15 months after its approval and less than two years since marathon acquisition of its interests in equatorial guinea. by year-end 2003, gross condensate production had grown from 18,000 to 30,000 bpd. the phase 2b lpg expansion project is on schedule with an expected start-up near the end of 2004. full lpg production of 20,000 bpd gross (11,600 bpd net) is expected in early 2005. phase 2a and phase 2b full condensate production of 59,000 bpd gross (32,600 bpd net to marathon) is expected in early 2005. in russia, marathon acquisition of kmoc in 2003 resulted in additional proved reserves of approximately 95 million boe. current net daily production of 16,000 net bpd from these operations is expected to increase to more than 60,000 net bpd within five years. 48 table of contents in norway, marathon is evaluating development options associated with the exploration success in alvheim and klegg. marathon and its partners are evaluating several development scenarios for alvheim, in which marathon is operator and holds a 65 percent interest. marathon expects to submit a development plan to the norwegian authorities during the second quarter of 2004. marathon holds a 47 percent interest in klegg and expects a development plan to be approved in 2004. production from these combined developments is expected to reach more than 50,000 net bpd during 2007. on february 23, 2004, marathon and its alvheim project partners announced the signing of a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a multipurpose shuttle tanker. in the gulf of mexico, marathon and its partners in the neptune unit are integrating the results of this discovery into field development studies and plan to spud another appraisal well on this discovery during the first quarter of 2004. marathon holds a 30 percent interest in the neptune unit. in december 2003, marathon and its partners, in the corrib project offshore ireland, submitted a new planning application to construct an onshore gas terminal for the corrib natural gas discovery. final planning approval for the onshore terminal is expected by the end of 2004. in qatar, marathon and three other companies are exploring the possibility of developing a portion of the north field offshore qatar, including infrastructure for gas processing facilities and a gtl plant. in wyoming powder river basin, marathon plans to drill approximately 400 coal bed natural gas wells in 2004. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of marathon worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, the exploration drilling program, possible additional resources, the phase 2b lng expansion project, the possibility of an equipment purchase, and the expected date for final planning approval for an onshore terminal. some factors that could potentially affect worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, the exploration drilling program and possible additional resources include acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and gas properties, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, achieving definitive agreements among project participants, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other geological, operating and economic considerations. factors that could affect the phase 2b lpg expansion project include unforeseen problems arising from construction and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. factors affecting the possibility of the equipment purchase include the partners approval of the development of the alvheim area and the subsequent approval of a plan of development and operation by the norwegian authorities. the final planning approval for the onshore terminal is contingent upon governmental approval. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. refining, marketing and transportation marathon rm&amp;t segment income is largely dependent upon the refining and wholesale marketing margin for refined products, the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates, and the gross margin on retail merchandise sales. the refining and wholesale marketing margin reflects the difference between the wholesale selling prices of refined products and the cost of raw materials refined, purchased product costs and manufacturing expenses. refining and wholesale marketing margins have been historically volatile and vary from the impact of competition and with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, the seasonal pattern of certain product sales, crude oil costs, manufacturing costs, the available supply of crude oil and refined products, and logistical constraints. the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates reflects the difference between the retail selling prices of these products and their wholesale cost, including secondary transportation. retail gasoline and distillate margins have also been historically volatile, but tend to be countercyclical to the refining and wholesale marketing margin. factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. the gross margin on retail merchandise sales tends to be less volatile than the retail gasoline and distillate margin. factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in the marketing area. 49 table of contents map has completed the approximately $440 million multi-year catlettsburg, kentucky, refinery repositioning project. this major operations improvement project includes the deactivation of the existing, old fluid catalytic cracking unit (fccu) and the conversion and expansion of the existing atmospheric residue catalytic cracking unit into an fccu. this project is expected to increase the value of the refined products produced at catlettsburg, improve cost efficiency and enable the refinery to meet new low sulfur gasoline standards. project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. map has commenced approximately $300 million in new capital projects for its 74,000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. one of the projects, a $110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100,000 bpd. other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. completion of the projects are scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. a map subsidiary, ohio river pipe line llc ( orpl ), completed a 150-mile refined product pipeline from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio in late 2003. the pipeline is an interstate common carrier pipeline. the pipeline is known as cardinal products pipeline and is expected to initially move about 36,000 bpd of refined petroleum into the central ohio region. the pipeline, which has a capacity of up to 80,000 bpd, is expected to provide a stable, cost effective supply of gasoline, diesel and jet fuels to this market. overlapping planned maintenance projects, including investments in the tier 2 ultra-low sulfur gasoline production upgrades, will reduce map 935,000 bpd crude oil capacity such that it expects to process about 775,000 bpd of crude oil in the first quarter of 2004. map expects its average crude oil throughput for the total year 2004 to be at or above historical levels. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the detroit capital projects and the cardinal products pipeline system. some factors that could affect the detroit construction projects include availability of materials and labor, permitting approvals, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. factors that could impact the cardinal products pipeline include the price of petroleum products and other supply issues. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas marathon continues to make progress on its phase 3 expansion project in equatorial guinea. to commercialize the significant gas resources in equatorial guinea alba field, marathon, the government of equatorial guinea and gepetrol, the national oil company of equatorial guinea, have signed a heads of agreement on a package of fiscal terms and conditions for the development of the lng project on bioko island. marathon and gepetrol plan to develop a 3.4 million metric tonnes per year lng plant, with start up currently projected for late 2007. marathon and gepetrol have also signed a letter of understanding (lou) with a subsidiary of bg group plc ( bgml ) under which bgml would purchase the lng plant production for a period of 17 years on an fob bioko island basis with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index. the lng would be targeted primarily to a receiving terminal in lake charles, louisiana, where it would be regasified and delivered into the gulf coast natural gas pipeline grid. the provisions of the lou are subject to a definitive purchase and sale agreement which the parties expect to finalize by the second quarter of 2004. pending final approval of all commercial and governmental agreements, a final investment decision is expected to be concluded by second quarter 2004. the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the estimated construction and startup dates of a lng liquefaction plant and related facilities and the purchase of lng by bgml. factors that could affect the purchase of lng by bgml and the estimated construction and startup dates of the lng liquefaction plant and related facilities include, without limitation, the successful negotiation and execution of a definitive purchase and sale agreement for lng supply, board approval of the transactions, approval of the lng project by the government of equatorial guinea, unforeseen difficulty in negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, arranging sufficient financing, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, competition with similar projects, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 50 table of contents corporate matters marathon has announced organizational and business process changes to increase efficiency, profitability and shareholder value and to achieve projected annual pretax savings of more than $135 million, including $70 million related to map. it is anticipated that most of these changes will be completed during the first half 2004, and will result in pretax charges of approximately $75 million ($10 million of which is related to map), including benefit plan curtailment and settlement effects of $24 million. approximately $24 million of the estimated $75 million charges has been recorded in 2003, with the remainder to be recognized when incurred during the first half 2004. marathon expects that pension and other postretirement plan expense in 2004 will increase approximately $65 million from 2003 levels, of which approximately $21 million relates to map. the total includes $34 million related to pension plan settlements as a result of the business transformation. map, and marathon foreign subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately $93 million and $22 million to the funded pension plans in 2004. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to projected annual cost savings from organizational and business process improvements, the projected completion time for implementation of the changes and pension and other postretirement plan expenses. factors, but not necessarily all factors, that could adversely affect these expected results include possible delays in consolidating the u.s. production organization, future acquisitions or dispositions, technological developments, actions of government or other regulatory bodies in areas affected by these organizational changes, unforeseen hazards, regulatory impacts, and other economic or political considerations. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. accounting standards not yet adopted an issue currently on the emerging issues task force ( eitf ) agenda, issue no. 03-s applicability of fasb statement no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets , to oil and gas companies, will address how oil and gas companies should classify the costs of acquiring contractual mineral interests in oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. the eitf is considering an alternative interpretation of statement of financial accounting standard no. 142 goodwill and other intangible assets that mineral or drilling rights or leases, concessions or other interests representing the right to extract oil or gas should be classified as intangible assets rather than oil and gas properties. management believes that our current balance sheet classification for these costs is appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. if a reclassification is ultimately required, the estimated amount of the leasehold acquisition costs to be reclassified would be $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion at december 31, 2003 and 2002. should such a change be required, there would be no impact on our previously filed income statements (or reported net income), statements of cash flow or statements of stockholders equity for prior periods. additional disclosures related to intangible assets would also be required. 51 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. marathon uses commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. to a lesser extent, marathon is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and on petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials. marathon strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. marathon will use a variety of derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price risk within its different businesses. as market conditions change, marathon evaluates its risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of commodity-based derivatives will be based on market prices. marathon e&amp;p segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to selectively lock in realized prices on portions of its future production when deemed advantageous to do so. marathon rm&amp;t segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories, to protect margins on fixed-price sales of refined products and to lock-in the price spread between refined products and crude oil. map recently expanded its trading strategies (through the use of sold options) to take advantage of opportunities in the commodity markets. marathon oerb segment is exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas. marathon uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes. marathon uses financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposures. as marathon enters into derivatives, assessments are made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting. management believes that use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose marathon to material risk. however, the use of derivative instruments could materially affect marathon results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity. 52 table of contents commodity price risk sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations ( ifo ) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december 31, 2003 and december 31, 2002, are provided in the following table: (a) (in millions) incremental decrease in ifo assuming a hypothetical price change of (a) 2003 2002 derivative commodity instruments (b)(c) 10% 25% 10% 25% crude oil (d) $ 28.3 (e) $ 87.9 (e) $ 42.3 (e) $ 141.8 (e) natural gas (d) 29.1 (e) 73.5 (e) 39.5 (e) 120.3 (e) refined products (d) 3.6 (e) 9.1 (e) 1.5 (e) 6.5 (e) (a) marathon remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. amounts reflect hypothetical 10% and 25% changes in closing commodity prices, excluding basis swaps, for each open contract position at december 31, 2003 and 2002. marathon evaluates its portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated market conditions and changes in risk profiles. marathon is also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. the creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements to the extent practical. changes to the portfolio after december 31, 2003, would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented in the table. (b) net open contracts for the combined e&amp;p and oerb segments varied throughout 2003, from a low of 24,375 contracts at october 8 to a high of 52,470 contracts at october 17, and averaged 37,068 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the rm&amp;t segment varied throughout 2003, from a low of 30 contracts at july 19 to a high of 23,412 contracts at december 4, and averaged 9,850 for the year. the derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects. (c) the calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated. gains and losses on options are based on changes in intrinsic value only. (d) the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would result in the largest incremental decrease in ifo when applied to the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge that commodity. (e) price increase. e&amp;p segment at december 31, 2003 the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding. all contracts currently qualify for hedge accounting unless noted. contract type (a) period daily volume (b) % of estimated production (b) average price natural gas option collars january december 2004 23 mmcfd 2 % $7.15 - $4.25 mcf swaps january december 2004 50 mmcfd 5 % $5.02 mcf crude oil option collars 2004 44 mbpd 23 % $29.67 - $24.26 bbl (a) these contracts may be subject to margin calls above certain limits established by counterparties. (b) volumes and percentages are based on the estimated production on an annualized basis. derivative gains (losses) included in the e&amp;p segment were $(176) million, $52 million and $85 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001. losses of $66 million and gains of $18 million are included in segment results for 2003 and 2002, respectively, on long-term gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and marked-to-market. additionally, losses of $8 million and gains of $23 million from discontinued cash flow hedges are included in segment results for 2003 and 2002. the discontinued cash flow hedge amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur. 53 table of contents rm&amp;t segment marathon rm&amp;t operations primarily use derivative commodity instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories, to protect margins on fixed price sales of refined products and to lock-in the price spread between refined products and crude oil. derivative instruments are used to mitigate the price risk between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. in addition, natural gas options are in place to manage the price risk associated with approximately 60% of the anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use through the first quarter of 2004 and 50% through the second quarter of 2004. derivative commodity instruments are also used to protect the value of excess refined product, crude oil and lpg inventories. derivatives are used to lock in margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers. derivative commodity instruments are used to protect against decreases in the future crack spreads. within a limited framework, derivative instruments are also used to take advantage of opportunities identified in the commodity markets. derivative gains (losses) included in rm&amp;t segment income for each of the last two years are summarized in the following table: strategy (in millions) 2003 2002 mitigate price risk $ (112 ) $ (95 ) protect carrying values of excess inventories (57 ) (41 ) protect margin on fixed price sales 5 11 protect crack spread values 6 1 trading activities (4 ) total net derivative losses $ (162 ) $ (124 ) generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying physical commodity transaction. oerb segment marathon has used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. the underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. similarly, marathon will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term (typically less than a year) fixed price contracts to market prices in its ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. derivative gains (losses) included in oerb segment income were $19 million, $(8) million and $(29) million for 2003, 2002 and 2001. oerb trading activity gains (losses) of $(7) million, $4 million and $(1) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001 are included in the aforementioned amounts. other commodity risk marathon is subject to basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. for example, new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana henry hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices. to the extent that commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. these regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. otc transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk. marathon is subject to liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position. due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions. 54 table of contents interest rate risk marathon is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations affecting the fair value of certain financial instruments. a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table: (in millions) december 31, 2003 december 31, 2002 financial instruments (a) fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) fair value (b) incremental increase in fair value (c) financial assets: investments and long-term receivables $ 186 $ $ 223 $ interest rate swap agreements $ 4 $ 16 $ 12 $ 8 financial liabilities: long-term debt ( d)(e) $ 4,740 $ 176 $ 5,008 $ 194 (a) fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. (b) see note 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for carrying value of instruments. (c) for long-term debt, this assumes a 10% decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of marathon long-term debt at december 31, 2003 and 2002. for interest rate swap agreements, this assumes a 10% decrease in the effective swap rate at december 31, 2003. (d) includes amounts due within one year. (e) fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. at december 31, 2003 and 2002, marathon portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. this sensitivity is illustrated by the $176 million increase in the fair value of long-term debt assuming a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates. however, marathon sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect marathon results and cash flows only to the extent that marathon would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value. marathon has initiated a program to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. the primary objective of this program is to reduce marathon overall cost of borrowing by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio. beginning in 2002, marathon entered into several interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. the following table summarizes, by individual debt instrument, the interest rate swap activity as of december 31, 2003: floating rate to be paid fixed rate to be received notional amount ($millions) swap maturity fair value ($millions) six month libor +4.226% 6.650 % $ 300 2006 $ 1 six month libor +1.935% 5.375 % $ 450 2007 $ 6 six month libor +3.285% 6.850 % $ 400 2008 $ 3 six month libor +2.142% 6.125 % $ 200 2012 $ (6 ) 55 table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk marathon has a program to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward contracts. the primary objective of this program is to reduce marathon exposure to movements in the foreign currency markets by locking in foreign currency rates. as of december 31, 2003, marathon had no open contracts. credit risk marathon has significant credit risk exposure to united states steel arising from the separation. that exposure is discussed in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on page 43. safe harbor marathon quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and other feedstocks. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to marathon hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 56 table of contentsrisk factors 24 risk factors, item 3. legal proceedings, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, bitumen and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions, map is wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. acquisition of western oil sands inc. on october 18, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of western oil sands inc. ( western ) for cash and securities of $5.833 billion. western debt was $1.063 billion at closing. western primary asset was a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of alberta, canada. the acquisition was accounted for under the 2 table of contents index to financial statements purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include western results from october 18, 2007. western oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment. segment and geographic information our operations consist of four operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and by-products; 3) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states; and 4) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. we conduct exploration, development and production activities in 11 countries. principal exploration activities are in the united states, angola, norway and indonesia. principal development and production activities are in the united states, the united kingdom, norway, ireland, equatorial guinea and libya. our 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 197 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2007 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 925 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2007 worldwide net sales averaged 351 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). (for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.) in 2008, our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are expected to average 380 to 420 mboepd, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions. the above projections of 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are forward-looking statements. some factors that could potentially affect levels of sales include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. exploration in the united states during 2007, we drilled 59 gross (39 net) exploratory wells of which 47 gross (29 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 47 wells, none were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 25 gross (6 net) exploratory wells of which 16 gross (4 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 16 wells, 10 gross (3 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2007. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for us. at the end of 2007, we had interests in 71 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 64 in the deepwater area. in october 2007, we were the high bidder on 27 blocks offered in the federal outer continental shelf lease sale no. 205 conducted by the u.s. minerals management service ( mms ) and were awarded these leases in early 2008. representing a total net investment of $222 million for us, 13 blocks were bid 100 percent by us, and the remaining 14 blocks were bid in conjunction with partners. our plans call for initial drilling on some of these leases in 2009 or 2010. the contract for the rig has an initial term of two years with an option to extend for an additional two years. 3 table of contents index to financial statements in 2007, we drilled the droshky (previously named troika deep) deepwater discovery well. this well and two appraisal sidetrack wells are located on green canyon block 244 in the gulf of mexico and we are in the process of drilling additional appraisal wells. we have secured an additional year of drilling rig capacity in 2009 for development drilling in anticipation of a 2008 project sanction. the timing of initial production from the droshky discovery will be dependent upon delivery of key equipment and regulatory approvals, but could be as early as 2010. we hold a 100 percent working interest in the drohsky discovery. in late 2007, drilling of an appraisal well began on the stones prospect (walker ridge block 508) after a 2005 discovery. we hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest in the stones prospect. in 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the ozona prospect (garden banks block 515) in the gulf of mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled. we are continuing to evaluate options to develop the ozona prospect. commercial terms have been secured for the tie-back and processing of ozona production and we have been actively searching for a rig to drill the development well. we hold a 68 percent operated interest in the ozona prospect. angola offshore angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in block 32. through february 2008, 27 discoveries on these blocks have been announced, including eight in 2007 and one in early 2008. these discoveries represent four potential development hubs. four discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. nine other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. seven of the block 32 discoveries form our first potential development in the eastern area of that block. norway we hold interests in over 800,000 gross acres offshore norway and plan to continue our exploration effort there. we hold a 28 percent outside-operated interest in the gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of norway, where we are focused on subsurface evaluation and assessing development concepts after a successful appraisal well in 2006. first production from gudrun is expected in 2012. in 2007, we also continued to advance exploration opportunities in the alvheim area, the first of which is expected to be drilled in 2009. indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we will begin collecting geophysical data in the first quarter of 2008. we expect to begin exploratory drilling in 2009. in addition, we were awarded two study agreements and farmed into additional study agreements in indonesia in 2007 which could lead to the acquisition of new leaseholds at a future lease sale. equatorial guinea during 2004, we announced the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, in which we hold a 63 percent operated interest, and the corona well on block d, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline or additional lng markets are entered that require increased natural gas supply. libya we hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2007 included the drilling of eight wells, six of which were successful. most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration-stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. united kingdom during 2007, we acquired a 45 percent outside-operated interest in three exploratory onshore coal bed methane licenses in the united kingdom, representing 128,000 gross acres. three exploration wells have been drilled on two of the licenses and additional delineation and production testing is planned during 2008. we also plan to participate in the u.k. onshore licensing round during 2008 to secure additional acreage. in the u.k. portion of the north sea, marathon participated in a discovery in block 204/23 adjacent to the foinaven field. this foinaven southwest discovery encountered hydrocarbons and will be considered for a potential tieback to the nearby infrastructure. 4 table of contents index to financial statements ukraine in 2007, we signed a cooperation agreement with a ukrainian partner to carry out a study in the dneiper-donets basin in north central ukraine. the joint study will be conducted over three years on an area of joint interest covering 10,000 square miles and could lead to the joint exploration for hydrocarbons. production (including development activities) united states our u.s. operations accounted for 32 percent of our 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 52 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. during 2007, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 25 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 39 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 28 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 6 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in the gulf of mexico decreased from the prior year, mainly due to normal production rate declines. at year-end 2007, we held interests in seven producing fields and eight platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which we operate four platforms. the majority of our sales volumes in the gulf of mexico come from the petronius development in viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. we own a 50 percent outside-operated working interest in these blocks. the petronius platform provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. for example, petronius processes the production from our perseus field which commenced production in april 2005 and is located five miles from the platform. we hold a 30 percent outside-operated working interest in the neptune deepwater development on atwater valley blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the gulf of mexico, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the development plan for neptune was sanctioned in 2005 and includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone mini-tension leg platform. construction of the platform and facility continued through 2007 with first production expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008. we believe that we are one of the largest natural gas producers in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2007, our net natural gas sales from alaska averaged 142 mmcfd, representing 30 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales volumes. our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 20 mbpd and 114 mmcfd in 2007. our wyoming net natural gas sales decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of natural field declines, partially offset by new wells in the wamsutter and powder river basin areas. development of the powder river basin continued in 2007 with 170 operated wells drilled, which was up from the 119 wells drilled in 2006. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2007 where we participated in the drilling of 30 wells. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas and north louisiana, with combined net sales of 148 mmcfd in 2007, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the permian basin of southeast new mexico and west texas, with net sales of 12 mbpd in 2007. we hold 320,000 acres in the williston basin (the bakken shale formation) following the acquisition of an additional 70,000 acres in late 2007. the majority of the acreage is located in north dakota with the remainder in eastern montana. this represents a substantial position in the bakken shale with approximately 350 locations to be drilled over the next four to five years. we currently have six operated drilling rigs running in our bakken shale program and ended 2007 with a net production rate of 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. we hold a natural gas leasehold in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. the acreage is located near adjacent production. our plans include drilling approximately 700 wells in the next ten years. drilling and production commenced in late 2007. 5 table of contents index to financial statements united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. our share of liquid hydrocarbon sales from the brae area averaged 14 mbpd in 2007. our share of brae natural gas sales averaged 139 mmcfd, or 31 percent of our international natural gas sales volumes, in 2007 and decreased from the prior year as a result of natural field declines in the north and east brae natural gas condensate fields. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area and the third-party beryl area and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the britannia, atlantic and cromarty fields. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own an approximate 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. our share of sales from the foinaven fields averaged 17 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 9 mmcfd of natural gas in 2007. norway norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed above. we were approved for our first operatorship on the norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate eight licenses. we are the operator of the alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf. this development is comprised of the kameleon and kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. the complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ( fpso ) with subsea infrastructure. produced oil will be transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas will be transported to the sage system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. the multipurpose shuttle tanker that has been modified to serve as the fpso sailed from the shipyard in mid-february 2008 to undergo testing, after which it will proceed offshore for connection to the subsea infrastructure. the alvheim development will initially include ten producing wells and two water disposal wells in the drilling program, which will continue through the fourth quarter of 2008. the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated working interest, will also be produced through the alvheim fpso. the two vilje development wells were drilled and completed in 2007. first production from the alvheim/vilje development is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008, weather permitting. in early 2007, the norwegian government approved a plan for development and operation to develop the volund field as a subsea tie-back to the alvheim fpso. the volund development will consist of one production well and one water disposal well, both of which will be drilled in the first half of 2009 with an additional two wells to be drilled in the latter part of 2009. the produced oil will be exported via the shuttle tankers discussed above, and the associated natural gas will be exported via the alvheim-to-sage pipeline. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent working interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in 2009. during 2007, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in norway from the heimdal, vale and skirne fields averaged 2 mbpd and 29 mmcfd. we own a 24 percent outside-operated working interest in the heimdal field, a 47 percent outside-operated working interest in the vale field and a 20 percent outside-operated working interest in the skirne field. ireland we own a 100 percent working interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale natural gas fields and an 87 percent operated working interest in the seven heads natural gas field in the celtic sea offshore ireland. net natural gas sales in ireland were 39 mmcfd in 2007. in june 2006, we were awarded the first commercial natural gas storage license in ireland, which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the southwest kinsale field. the unit has a total working volume of 7 bcf per annum. both indigenous 6 table of contents index to financial statements kinsale natural gas and natural gas imported from a transmission system are injected and withdrawn from the facility under contractual arrangements that expire in april 2009. additionally, natural gas produced from our other fields or purchased from other parties can be stored at southwest kinsale for future sale to customers. we own a 19 percent working interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off ireland northwest coast, where six of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. two wells have been completed, and three additional wells are planned to be completed in 2008. the main 20-inch offshore pipeline installation is also planned for 2008. terminal construction is underway. the operator expects first production from the field in the fourth quarter of 2009. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant held through an equity method investee. during 2007, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 45 mbpd, or 34 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 228 mmcfd, or 51 percent of our international natural gas sales volumes. net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2007 included 33 mbpd of condensate and 12 mbpd of lpg. as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ). ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. alba field dry natural gas, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities. during 2007, a gross 130 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 268 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production. libya net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 45 mbpd in 2007 compared to 54 mbpd in 2006, of which a total of 8 mbpd were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations in libya. the 2007 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya represented 34 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. net natural gas sales in libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2007. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent working interest. net sales in gabon averaged 10 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2007. production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at tchatamba marin, with the processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. other matters we hold an interest in an exploration and production license in sudan. we suspended all operations in sudan in 1985 due to civil unrest. we have had no employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. the u.s. government imposed sanctions against sudan in 1997 and we have not made any payments related to sudan since then. we have abided and will continue to abide by all u.s. sanctions related to sudan. we have reached an agreement to transfer our interest in this license to the operator. governmental approval of this transfer is expected in the first quarter of 2008. we discovered the ash shaer and cherrife natural gas fields in syria in the 1980s. we have recognized no revenues in any period from activities in syria and we impaired our entire investment in syria in 1998. in 2006, the syrian government approved the assignment of 90 percent of our interest in the ash shaer and cherrife natural gas fields to a non-u.s. company. we closed the transaction on november 1, 2006, and received cash proceeds of $46 million. the remaining 10 percent interest was assigned to the same company on december 21, 2007, for $5 million. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing the gudrun field offshore norway, blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the foinaven southwest discovery in the u.k. portion of the north sea and the equatorial guinea discoveries, the possibility of obtaining access to new leaseholds in indonesia and additional coal bed methane licenses in the united kingdom, joint exploration for hydrocarbons in the ukraine and the timing of production from the droshky discovery, the gudrun discovery, the neptune development, the alvheim/vilje development, the volund field and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards 7 table of contents index to financial statements such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. except for the neptune, alvheim/vilje and volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments on the gudrun field, blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the foinaven southwest discovery and the equatorial guinea discoveries could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. factors that could affect joint exploration for hydrocarbons in the ukraine include results of technical studies and continued favorable investment climate. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment also includes forward-looking statements with respect to our intention to exit a license in sudan which could be potentially impacted by a delay in receiving governmental approval. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. reserves at december 31, 2007, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1.225 billion boe, of which 42 percent were located in organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) countries. the following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the

businesses that were sold in june 2006. proved developed liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves represented 72 percent of total proved reserves as of december 31, 2007, as compared to 68 percent as of december 31, 2006. of the 346 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2007, 58 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 17 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2007. during 2007, we added a total of 88 million boe of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural reserves, principally in libya, norway and the piceance basin of colorado. we disposed of 0.2 million boe, while producing 8 table of contents index to financial statements 125 million boe. of the total net proved reserve additions, 38 million boe were proved developed and 50 million boe were proved undeveloped reserves. during 2007, we transferred 109 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, were $1.250 billion, $1.010 billion and $955 million. as of december 31, 2007, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves for the years 2008 through 2010 are projected to be $859 million, $376 million and $293 million. the above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation process, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. we filed reports with the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) for 2006 disclosing our total year-end estimated liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. the year-end estimates reported to the doe are the same estimates reported in the supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. delivery commitments we sell liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver 180 bcf of natural gas in the future. these contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2018. our proved reserves in alaska, the united kingdom and other locations, are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales the following tables set forth the daily average net sales volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas for each of

through our acquisition of western, we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from certain oil sands deposits in the athabasca region and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oil. the aosp initial asset is the mining and extraction operations of the muskeg river mine located 45 miles north of fort mcmurray, alberta, 11 table of contents index to financial statements which began bitumen production in 2003, together with upgrading infrastructure located northeast of edmonton, alberta. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties paid to the province. as of december 31, 2007, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling 46,000 net acres. we are entitled to participate in future expansion opportunities on other nearby oil sands leases owned by the operator and, prior to december 6, 2009, on any new lands acquired by either of the other aosp owners within a defined area of mutual interest. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into high-quality, synthetic crude oils. bitumen production from the mine is taken by pipeline to the scotford upgrader, which uses hydro-conversion technology to upgrade the bitumen into two streams of synthetic crude oil (premium albian synthetic and albian heavy synthetic) and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to the operator under a long-term contract for use in its refinery adjacent to the upgrading facility. when the aosp is operating at its current capacity, our net bitumen production is 30 mbpd, but operations were curtailed at the scotford upgrader subsequent to the western acquisition date due to a mid-november fire. maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december. net bitumen production averaged 4 mbpd for 2007, based on total volumes from the october 18, 2007 acquisition date over total days in the year. bitumen production averaged 19 mbpd for the post-acquisition period. as of december 31, 2007, our net proved bitumen reserves were estimated to be 421 million barrels. proved reserves can be added as expansions are permitted, funding is approved and certain stipulations of the joint venture agreement are satisfied. in 2006, the first fully-integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved. the phase 1 expansion includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine and expansion of the scotford upgrader, along with construction of common infrastructure sized to support future mining expansions. the aosp phase 1 expansion is under construction and we anticipate that it will be complete in late 2010. work is underway to determine the feasibility of additional aosp expansion projects including pursuing regulatory approvals. the above estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is a forward-looking statement and is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved bitumen reserves estimation process, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved bitumen reserves. operations at the aosp are outside the scope of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no. 25, suspension of certain accounting requirements for oil and gas producing companies (an amendment of fasb statement no. 19), sfas no. 69, disclosures about oil and gas producing activities (an amendment of fasb statements 19, 25, 33 and 39), and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) rule 4-10 of regulation s-x; therefore, bitumen production and reserves are not included in our supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of the aosp expansion project. factors which could affect the project include transportation logistics, availability of material and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks associated with construction projects. refining, marketing and transportation refining we own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1.016 million barrels per day ( mmbpd ) of crude oil. during 2007, our refineries processed 1.010 mmbpd of crude oil and 214 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. the table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our refineries as of december 31, 2007. these capacity amounts increased from 974 mbpd in 2006 due to overall efficiency gains in the operation of the refining units, reflecting the cumulative effect of regular maintenance, capital improvements and other process optimization efforts. 12 table of contents index to financial statements crude oil refining capacity (thousands of barrels per day) garyville, louisiana 256 catlettsburg, kentucky 226 robinson, illinois 204 detroit, michigan 102 canton, ohio 78 texas city, texas 76 st. paul park, minnesota 74 total 1,016 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low-sulfur gasolines and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. we also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. we manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax. our refineries are integrated via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. also, by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. we completed fluid catalytic cracking unit turnarounds at our catlettsburg, robinson and st. paul park refineries in 2007. the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years. refined product yields (thousands

1,192 in 2006, we approved an expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery by 180 mbpd to 436 mbpd, at a projected cost of $3.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). construction commenced in early 2007 and continues on schedule with additional project construction phases commencing in early 2008. we expect to complete the expansion in late 2009. in 2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit, michigan refinery, at a projected cost of $1.9 billion (excluding capitalized interest). this project will enable the refinery to process additional heavy, sour crude oils, including canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 15 percent. construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2008, subject to obtaining necessary environmental permits, and is expected to be completed in late 2010. when completed, these two expansion projects will increase our current total crude oil refining capacity by 19 percent. marketing we are a supplier of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our market area in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. in 2007, our refined products sales volumes totaled 21.6 billion gallons, or 1.410 mmbpd. the average sales price of our refined 13 table of contents index to financial statements products in aggregate was $86.53 per barrel for 2007. the following table sets forth our refined products sales by product group and our average sales price for each of the last three years. refined product sales

accounting for matching buy/sell arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. this change resulted in lower refined products sales volumes for 2007 and the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under our previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers and sales in the spot market accounted for 69 percent of our refined products sales volumes in 2007. we sold 49 percent of our gasoline volumes and 89 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis. half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics and sulfur are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the united states and canada, with pitch products also being exported worldwide. we market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. our customer base includes approximately 750 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. we have blended ethanol with gasoline for over 15 years and increased our blending program in 2007, in part due to renewable fuel mandates. we blended 41 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2007 and 35 mbpd in both 2006 and 2005. the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and changes in government regulations. we sell reformulated gasoline in parts of our marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; milwaukee, wisconsin and hartford, illinois, and we sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. we also sell biodiesel in minnesota, illinois and kentucky. as of december 31, 2007, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,400 marathon branded-retail outlets located primarily in ohio, michigan, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in georgia, florida, minnesota, wisconsin, north carolina, tennessee, west virginia, virginia, south carolina, alabama, pennsylvania, and texas. sales to marathon-brand jobbers and dealers accounted for 16 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2007. speedway superamerica llc ( ssa ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and diesel fuel primarily through retail outlets that we operate. sales of refined products through these ssa retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined products sales volumes in 2007. as of december 31, 2007, ssa had 1,636 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names speedway and superamerica. ssa revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.796 billion in 2007, compared with $2.706 billion in 2006. profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. ssa also operates 59 valvoline instant oil change retail outlets located in michigan and northwest ohio. pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ), our joint venture with pilot corporation ( pilot ), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with 286 locations in 37 states and canada at december 31, 2007. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand-name restaurants at many locations. pilot and marathon each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. 14 table of contents index to financial statements our retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. supply and transportation we obtain most of the crude oil we refine from negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. in 2007, u.s.-sourced crude oil averaged 527 mbpd, or 52 percent, of the crude oil processed at our refineries, including a net 15 mbpd from our production operations included in the e&amp;p segment. canada was the source for 14 percent, or 138 mbpd, of crude oil processed in 2007. other foreign sources supplied 34 percent, or 345 mbpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including 180 mbpd from the middle east. this crude oil was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. the following table provides information on the sources of crude oil for each of the last three years. sources of crude oil refined (thousands of barrels per day) 2007 2006 2005 united states 527 470 447

system of pipelines, terminals and barges to provide crude oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing areas. at december 31, 2007, we owned, leased, operated or held equity method investments in 68 miles of crude oil gathering lines, 3,717 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,860 miles of refined products trunk lines. excluding equity method investees, our owned or operated common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years. pipeline barrels handled (thousands of barrels per day) 2007 2006 2005 crude oil

pipelines: 100 percent ownership of ohio river pipe line llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio, known as cardinal products pipeline; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana to north muskegon, michigan; 51 percent interest in loop llc ( loop ), the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at clovelly, louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting gulf coast refineries with the midwest market; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois; 15 table of contents index to financial statements 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest; 17 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our st. paul park, minnesota refinery; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois to toledo, ohio. our 85 owned and operated light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeastern united states. in october 2007, we executed an agreement to purchase four light product terminals in ohio and an ownership interest in a refined product pipeline. this transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2008, pending completion of various pre-closing activities, including obtaining necessary government approvals. our marine transportation operations include 15 towboats and 182 barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. we lease and own over 2,500 rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and over 150 tractors and tank trailers. ethanol production in 2007, we acquired a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol facility in clymers, indiana, and continued construction of another 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol facility in greenville, ohio. the greenville plant, in which we own a 50 percent interest, began production in february 2008. both of these facilities are managed by our partner, the andersons, inc. and will enable us to maintain the reliability of a portion of our future ethanol supplies. the above discussion of the rm&amp;t segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the expansion of the garyville refinery and the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. some factors that could affect those projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the above discussion also includes forward-looking statements concerning the purchase of four terminals and an interest in a pipeline which is subject to customary closing conditions and may be affected by the inability or delay in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and other operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. lng operations we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. in may 2007, egholdings completed construction of a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum ( mmtpa ) lng production facility on bioko island and delivered its first cargo of lng. lng from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on an fob bioko island basis, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. sales of lng from this production facility totaled 1,464,088 metric tonnes in 2007. in 2007 we completed those portions of the front-end engineering and design ( feed ) required to support the near-term efforts related to a potential second lng production facility on bioko island, equatorial guinea. the scope of the feed work for the potential 4.4 mmtpa lng project included feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil-off gas compression, product transfer to storage and lng product metering. we expect to make progress towards an investment decision in 2008. 16 table of contents index to financial statements we also own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and have an undivided interest in a long-term lease for two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, we have sold our share of the lng plant production under long-term contract with two of japan largest utility companies. this contract continues through march 2009, with 2007 lng deliveries totaling 48 bcf. in january 2007, along with our partner, we filed a request with the doe to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through march 2011. this application has received favorable support from the state of alaska but still requires final doe approval. in april 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes at the elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal pursuant to an lng sales and purchase agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as lng) per year, through march 31, 2021, with a possible extension to november 30, 2023. in september 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years. the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. methanol operations we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ampco owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field. sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1,060,653 metric tonnes in 2007. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the united states. natural gas technology we invest in natural gas technology research, including proprietary gas-to-fuels ( gtf ) technology which offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels while bypassing conventional intermediate synthetic gasification technology. the base patent for this technology was awarded in 2007. we have designed and are constructing a 10-bpd demonstration facility for this technology, with initial startup scheduled for the second half of 2008. expectations for the demonstration plant include the ability to demonstrate operations of the fully integrated process at a practical scale and to measure the conversion efficiencies of the total process, catalyst performance and materials durability. this critical performance data will support scale-up cost estimates for a commercial installation and provide the basis for continued technical developments in this area. in addition to gtf, we continue to evaluate the application of other natural gas technologies, including lng technology enhancements, gas hydrates and gas-to-liquids ( gtl ) technology. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility and expectations for a gtf demonstration facility. factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. factors that could potentially affect the gtf demonstration facility include construction delays, start-up difficulties relating to scale-up in the process and unforeseen difficulties in our testing program related to moving from laboratory to practical scale. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, we rank eighth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2006 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. 17 table of contents index to financial statements we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries in north america. there are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. in addition, not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil. there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2007. we compete in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products. we believe we compete with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; ten refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 275 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway . we also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in ptc. our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and 18 table of contents index to financial statements certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have us released from our obligations under a guarantee we provided with respect to all of united states steel obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2007 see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel for a discussion of our obligations associated with the separation. environmental matters the public policy committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. our corporate responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving marathon or any of our properties. legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. the kyoto protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. canadian federal and provincial laws, the u.s. energy independence and security act of 2007, the european union requirements and california laws contain provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions. other climate change legislation and regulations both in the united states and abroad are in various stages of development. our industry, and businesses throughout the united states, are also awaiting the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) actions upon the remand of the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. usepa which could have impacts on a number of air permitting and environmental regulatory programs. our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases. likewise, emissions arise from our rm&amp;t operations, including refining crude oil and transportation crude oil and refined products. although there may be adverse financial impact (including 19 table of contents index to financial statements compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain products) associated with any legislation, regulation, epa or other action, the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to newness of the requirements and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see legal proceedings and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air of particular significance to our refining operations are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in diesel fuel for off-road use. we now plan to spend approximately $350 million between 2006 and 2012 on refinery investments to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use, in compliance with epa regulations. this is a forward-looking statement. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect these compliance costs include final investment decisions, completion of project detailed engineering, construction and start-up activities. further, we previously estimated that we would spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with mobile source air toxics ii regulations relating to benzene. we have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these recently promulgated requirements, but the cost estimates will increase and may be approximately $1 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2008. the cost estimates have increased due to better definition of the projects needed to meet the requirements of the finalized regulations and updated construction cost estimates. the cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as feed work is completed in 2008. the epa is in the process of implementing regulations to address current national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. in connection with these standards, the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, the epa proposed a rule in 2004 called the interstate air quality rule ( iaqr ) that would require significant emissions reductions in numerous states. the final rule, promulgated in 2005, was renamed the clean air interstate rule ( cair ). while the epa expects that states will meet their cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units, states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. our refinery operations are located in affected states and some of these states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair. also, on july 11, 2007, the epa proposed a revised ozone standard. once the revised ozone standard is promulgated, the epa will begin the multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act. we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the states have taken further action and we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the revised ozone standard until the implementing rules are established. 20 table of contents index to financial statements water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90 and we have established spill prevention, control and countermeasures ( spcc ) plans for facilities subject to cwa spcc requirements. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. the rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm&amp;t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. ongoing rcra-related costs, however, are not expected to be material. in addition, canada will be implementing a ban on the land application of certain wastes and we are reviewing options to treat or dispose of these wastes consistent with these new restrictions. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. see legal proceedings environmental proceedings other proceedings for a discussion of these sites. other matters the energy policy act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) providing that all gasoline sold in the united states contain a minimum of 4.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006. the rfs increases gradually each year until 2012, when the rfs will be 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel. the epa issued a final rule in may 2007 and the program went into effect on september 1, 2007. we have put the necessary systems in place to track and report our compliance with these requirements. the recently-passed energy independence and security act of 2007 contains multiple rfss. the overall requirement starts with 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel required in 2008 and ramps up to 36.0 billion gallons in 2022. inside of the overall requirement is an advanced biofuels mandate which begins in 2009 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. subsets within the advanced biofuels requirements require 1.0 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel fuel by 2012 and 16.0 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022. the epa has not yet issued a proposal and a final rule to implement this program. this program presents specific challenges in that a refiner like us may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet its obligations to use advanced biofuels and cellulosic ethanol if it cannot produce these fuels itself. we may also experience a decrease in demand of our current refinery-produced petroleum products to the extent they are replaced by advanced biofuels and cellulosic 21 table of contents index to financial statements ethanol and overall demand does not increase to replace this loss. there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the mandates contained in this law and rule, but the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the uncertainty of these measures at this time. we are and will be developing potential strategies for compliance with such requirements. employees we had 29,524 active employees as of december 31, 2007. of that number, 19,578 were employees of ssa, most of who were employed at our retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2009. the same union represents certain hourly employees at our texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2009. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2009 at our st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2010 at our detroit refinery. executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon and their ages as of february 1, 2008, are as

table of contents index to financial statements item 1a. risk factors marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. the following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, as well as refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climatic changes; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain. lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, as well as lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, may reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves. the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group and/or third-party consultants we have retained. the estimates were calculated using liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices in effect as of december 31, 2007, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. any significant future price 24 table of contents index to financial statements changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically recoverable liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; and assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. the proved bitumen reserves information included in this report has also been derived from engineering estimates. reserves related to mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. proved reserves are measured by various testing and sampling methods. bitumen reserves as of december 31, 2007 were estimated by third-party consultants, using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and are subject to many of the same uncertainties discussed above. the estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. future proved bitumen reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and taxation. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production 25 table of contents index to financial statements performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; and the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs. increases in crude oil prices and environmental or other regulations may reduce our refining and wholesale marketing gross margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall rm&amp;t profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. in addition, various regulations have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our refining, marketing and transportation operations, which may reduce our refining and wholesale marketing gross margins. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is reasonably likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. although uncertain, these developments could increase costs or reduce the demand for the products we sell. our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence 26 table of contents index to financial statements or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 59 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2007 was derived from production outside the united states and 73 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2007 were located outside the united states. all of our bitumen production and proved reserves are located in canada. there are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. actions by both the united states and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and, therefore, we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather and labor disputes. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. these hazards could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could materially 27 table of contents index to financial statements reduce our profitability. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities. due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. we may not be successful in integrating and optimizing assets acquired in our acquisition of western . risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to: liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance; greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards, or for investments to improve operating results; difficulties in achieving anticipated operational improvements; diversion of management time and attention from our existing businesses and other priorities; and difficulties in integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of an acquired business into those of our existing operations. such acquisition risks are in addition to any risks inherent in the operations of an oil sands mining business. if ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland. as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland in 2005, marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to ashland interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions. however, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service. if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland. in that event, our indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland. marathon is required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland, which could be material. we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions. under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two baskets, as described below: 28 table of contents index to financial statements basket one this applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland. the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one. upon specified events related to ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two. in addition, basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two. because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland pre-transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two. the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a with and without basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group. thus, if the marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland. because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group tax liability for a particular year. this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation, ashland is required to repay such compensation to marathon. in the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc that was previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of the interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland. under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or, in some jurisdictions, less than fair consideration or valuable consideration; and the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. 29 table of contents index to financial statements in connection with our transactions with ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland shareholders. in order to help establish that ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired. we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to ashland existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) ashland receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) ashland solvency, it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon, united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $533 million as of december 31, 2007, including accrued interest of $8 million. if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel. in that event, our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel. the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 62 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, bitumen and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001 and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions, map is wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. acquisition of western oil sands inc. on october 18, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of western oil sands inc. ( western ) for cash and securities of $5.833 billion. western debt was $1.063 billion at closing. western primary asset was a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of alberta, canada. the acquisition was accounted for under the 2 table of contents index to financial statements purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include western results from october 18, 2007. western oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment. segment and geographic information our operations consist of four operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and by-products; 3) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states; and 4) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. we conduct exploration, development and production activities in 11 countries. principal exploration activities are in the united states, angola, norway and indonesia. principal development and production activities are in the united states, the united kingdom, norway, ireland, equatorial guinea and libya. our 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 197 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2007 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 925 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2007 worldwide net sales averaged 351 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). (for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.) in 2008, our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are expected to average 380 to 420 mboepd, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions. the above projections of 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are forward-looking statements. some factors that could potentially affect levels of sales include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. exploration in the united states during 2007, we drilled 59 gross (39 net) exploratory wells of which 47 gross (29 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 47 wells, none were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 25 gross (6 net) exploratory wells of which 16 gross (4 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 16 wells, 10 gross (3 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2007. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area for us. at the end of 2007, we had interests in 71 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 64 in the deepwater area. in october 2007, we were the high bidder on 27 blocks offered in the federal outer continental shelf lease sale no. 205 conducted by the u.s. minerals management service ( mms ) and were awarded these leases in early 2008. representing a total net investment of $222 million for us, 13 blocks were bid 100 percent by us, and the remaining 14 blocks were bid in conjunction with partners. our plans call for initial drilling on some of these leases in 2009 or 2010. the contract for the rig has an initial term of two years with an option to extend for an additional two years. 3 table of contents index to financial statements in 2007, we drilled the droshky (previously named troika deep) deepwater discovery well. this well and two appraisal sidetrack wells are located on green canyon block 244 in the gulf of mexico and we are in the process of drilling additional appraisal wells. we have secured an additional year of drilling rig capacity in 2009 for development drilling in anticipation of a 2008 project sanction. the timing of initial production from the droshky discovery will be dependent upon delivery of key equipment and regulatory approvals, but could be as early as 2010. we hold a 100 percent working interest in the drohsky discovery. in late 2007, drilling of an appraisal well began on the stones prospect (walker ridge block 508) after a 2005 discovery. we hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest in the stones prospect. in 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the ozona prospect (garden banks block 515) in the gulf of mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled. we are continuing to evaluate options to develop the ozona prospect. commercial terms have been secured for the tie-back and processing of ozona production and we have been actively searching for a rig to drill the development well. we hold a 68 percent operated interest in the ozona prospect. angola offshore angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in block 32. through february 2008, 27 discoveries on these blocks have been announced, including eight in 2007 and one in early 2008. these discoveries represent four potential development hubs. four discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. nine other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. seven of the block 32 discoveries form our first potential development in the eastern area of that block. norway we hold interests in over 800,000 gross acres offshore norway and plan to continue our exploration effort there. we hold a 28 percent outside-operated interest in the gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of norway, where we are focused on subsurface evaluation and assessing development concepts after a successful appraisal well in 2006. first production from gudrun is expected in 2012. in 2007, we also continued to advance exploration opportunities in the alvheim area, the first of which is expected to be drilled in 2009. indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we will begin collecting geophysical data in the first quarter of 2008. we expect to begin exploratory drilling in 2009. in addition, we were awarded two study agreements and farmed into additional study agreements in indonesia in 2007 which could lead to the acquisition of new leaseholds at a future lease sale. equatorial guinea during 2004, we announced the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, in which we hold a 63 percent operated interest, and the corona well on block d, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline or additional lng markets are entered that require increased natural gas supply. libya we hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2007 included the drilling of eight wells, six of which were successful. most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration-stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. united kingdom during 2007, we acquired a 45 percent outside-operated interest in three exploratory onshore coal bed methane licenses in the united kingdom, representing 128,000 gross acres. three exploration wells have been drilled on two of the licenses and additional delineation and production testing is planned during 2008. we also plan to participate in the u.k. onshore licensing round during 2008 to secure additional acreage. in the u.k. portion of the north sea, marathon participated in a discovery in block 204/23 adjacent to the foinaven field. this foinaven southwest discovery encountered hydrocarbons and will be considered for a potential tieback to the nearby infrastructure. 4 table of contents index to financial statements ukraine in 2007, we signed a cooperation agreement with a ukrainian partner to carry out a study in the dneiper-donets basin in north central ukraine. the joint study will be conducted over three years on an area of joint interest covering 10,000 square miles and could lead to the joint exploration for hydrocarbons. production (including development activities) united states our u.s. operations accounted for 32 percent of our 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 52 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. during 2007, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 25 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 39 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 28 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 6 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in the gulf of mexico decreased from the prior year, mainly due to normal production rate declines. at year-end 2007, we held interests in seven producing fields and eight platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which we operate four platforms. the majority of our sales volumes in the gulf of mexico come from the petronius development in viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. we own a 50 percent outside-operated working interest in these blocks. the petronius platform provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. for example, petronius processes the production from our perseus field which commenced production in april 2005 and is located five miles from the platform. we hold a 30 percent outside-operated working interest in the neptune deepwater development on atwater valley blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the gulf of mexico, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the development plan for neptune was sanctioned in 2005 and includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone mini-tension leg platform. construction of the platform and facility continued through 2007 with first production expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008. we believe that we are one of the largest natural gas producers in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2007, our net natural gas sales from alaska averaged 142 mmcfd, representing 30 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales volumes. our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 20 mbpd and 114 mmcfd in 2007. our wyoming net natural gas sales decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of natural field declines, partially offset by new wells in the wamsutter and powder river basin areas. development of the powder river basin continued in 2007 with 170 operated wells drilled, which was up from the 119 wells drilled in 2006. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2007 where we participated in the drilling of 30 wells. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas and north louisiana, with combined net sales of 148 mmcfd in 2007, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the permian basin of southeast new mexico and west texas, with net sales of 12 mbpd in 2007. we hold 320,000 acres in the williston basin (the bakken shale formation) following the acquisition of an additional 70,000 acres in late 2007. the majority of the acreage is located in north dakota with the remainder in eastern montana. this represents a substantial position in the bakken shale with approximately 350 locations to be drilled over the next four to five years. we currently have six operated drilling rigs running in our bakken shale program and ended 2007 with a net production rate of 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. we hold a natural gas leasehold in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. the acreage is located near adjacent production. our plans include drilling approximately 700 wells in the next ten years. drilling and production commenced in late 2007. 5 table of contents index to financial statements united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. our share of liquid hydrocarbon sales from the brae area averaged 14 mbpd in 2007. our share of brae natural gas sales averaged 139 mmcfd, or 31 percent of our international natural gas sales volumes, in 2007 and decreased from the prior year as a result of natural field declines in the north and east brae natural gas condensate fields. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area and the third-party beryl area and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the britannia, atlantic and cromarty fields. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own an approximate 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. our share of sales from the foinaven fields averaged 17 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 9 mmcfd of natural gas in 2007. norway norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed above. we were approved for our first operatorship on the norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate eight licenses. we are the operator of the alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf. this development is comprised of the kameleon and kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. the complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ( fpso ) with subsea infrastructure. produced oil will be transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas will be transported to the sage system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. the multipurpose shuttle tanker that has been modified to serve as the fpso sailed from the shipyard in mid-february 2008 to undergo testing, after which it will proceed offshore for connection to the subsea infrastructure. the alvheim development will initially include ten producing wells and two water disposal wells in the drilling program, which will continue through the fourth quarter of 2008. the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated working interest, will also be produced through the alvheim fpso. the two vilje development wells were drilled and completed in 2007. first production from the alvheim/vilje development is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008, weather permitting. in early 2007, the norwegian government approved a plan for development and operation to develop the volund field as a subsea tie-back to the alvheim fpso. the volund development will consist of one production well and one water disposal well, both of which will be drilled in the first half of 2009 with an additional two wells to be drilled in the latter part of 2009. the produced oil will be exported via the shuttle tankers discussed above, and the associated natural gas will be exported via the alvheim-to-sage pipeline. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent working interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in 2009. during 2007, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in norway from the heimdal, vale and skirne fields averaged 2 mbpd and 29 mmcfd. we own a 24 percent outside-operated working interest in the heimdal field, a 47 percent outside-operated working interest in the vale field and a 20 percent outside-operated working interest in the skirne field. ireland we own a 100 percent working interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale natural gas fields and an 87 percent operated working interest in the seven heads natural gas field in the celtic sea offshore ireland. net natural gas sales in ireland were 39 mmcfd in 2007. in june 2006, we were awarded the first commercial natural gas storage license in ireland, which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the southwest kinsale field. the unit has a total working volume of 7 bcf per annum. both indigenous 6 table of contents index to financial statements kinsale natural gas and natural gas imported from a transmission system are injected and withdrawn from the facility under contractual arrangements that expire in april 2009. additionally, natural gas produced from our other fields or purchased from other parties can be stored at southwest kinsale for future sale to customers. we own a 19 percent working interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off ireland northwest coast, where six of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. two wells have been completed, and three additional wells are planned to be completed in 2008. the main 20-inch offshore pipeline installation is also planned for 2008. terminal construction is underway. the operator expects first production from the field in the fourth quarter of 2009. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant held through an equity method investee. during 2007, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 45 mbpd, or 34 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 228 mmcfd, or 51 percent of our international natural gas sales volumes. net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2007 included 33 mbpd of condensate and 12 mbpd of lpg. as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ). ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. alba field dry natural gas, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities. during 2007, a gross 130 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 268 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production. libya net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 45 mbpd in 2007 compared to 54 mbpd in 2006, of which a total of 8 mbpd were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations in libya. the 2007 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya represented 34 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. net natural gas sales in libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2007. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent working interest. net sales in gabon averaged 10 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2007. production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at tchatamba marin, with the processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. other matters we hold an interest in an exploration and production license in sudan. we suspended all operations in sudan in 1985 due to civil unrest. we have had no employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. the u.s. government imposed sanctions against sudan in 1997 and we have not made any payments related to sudan since then. we have abided and will continue to abide by all u.s. sanctions related to sudan. we have reached an agreement to transfer our interest in this license to the operator. governmental approval of this transfer is expected in the first quarter of 2008. we discovered the ash shaer and cherrife natural gas fields in syria in the 1980s. we have recognized no revenues in any period from activities in syria and we impaired our entire investment in syria in 1998. in 2006, the syrian government approved the assignment of 90 percent of our interest in the ash shaer and cherrife natural gas fields to a non-u.s. company. we closed the transaction on november 1, 2006, and received cash proceeds of $46 million. the remaining 10 percent interest was assigned to the same company on december 21, 2007, for $5 million. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing the gudrun field offshore norway, blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the foinaven southwest discovery in the u.k. portion of the north sea and the equatorial guinea discoveries, the possibility of obtaining access to new leaseholds in indonesia and additional coal bed methane licenses in the united kingdom, joint exploration for hydrocarbons in the ukraine and the timing of production from the droshky discovery, the gudrun discovery, the neptune development, the alvheim/vilje development, the volund field and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards 7 table of contents index to financial statements such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. except for the neptune, alvheim/vilje and volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments on the gudrun field, blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the foinaven southwest discovery and the equatorial guinea discoveries could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. factors that could affect joint exploration for hydrocarbons in the ukraine include results of technical studies and continued favorable investment climate. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment also includes forward-looking statements with respect to our intention to exit a license in sudan which could be potentially impacted by a delay in receiving governmental approval. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. reserves at december 31, 2007, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1.225 billion boe, of which 42 percent were located in organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) countries. the following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the

businesses that were sold in june 2006. proved developed liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves represented 72 percent of total proved reserves as of december 31, 2007, as compared to 68 percent as of december 31, 2006. of the 346 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2007, 58 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 17 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2007. during 2007, we added a total of 88 million boe of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural reserves, principally in libya, norway and the piceance basin of colorado. we disposed of 0.2 million boe, while producing 8 table of contents index to financial statements 125 million boe. of the total net proved reserve additions, 38 million boe were proved developed and 50 million boe were proved undeveloped reserves. during 2007, we transferred 109 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, were $1.250 billion, $1.010 billion and $955 million. as of december 31, 2007, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves for the years 2008 through 2010 are projected to be $859 million, $376 million and $293 million. the above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation process, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. we filed reports with the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) for 2006 disclosing our total year-end estimated liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. the year-end estimates reported to the doe are the same estimates reported in the supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. delivery commitments we sell liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver 180 bcf of natural gas in the future. these contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2018. our proved reserves in alaska, the united kingdom and other locations, are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales the following tables set forth the daily average net sales volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas for each of

through our acquisition of western, we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from certain oil sands deposits in the athabasca region and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oil. the aosp initial asset is the mining and extraction operations of the muskeg river mine located 45 miles north of fort mcmurray, alberta, 11 table of contents index to financial statements which began bitumen production in 2003, together with upgrading infrastructure located northeast of edmonton, alberta. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties paid to the province. as of december 31, 2007, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling 46,000 net acres. we are entitled to participate in future expansion opportunities on other nearby oil sands leases owned by the operator and, prior to december 6, 2009, on any new lands acquired by either of the other aosp owners within a defined area of mutual interest. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into high-quality, synthetic crude oils. bitumen production from the mine is taken by pipeline to the scotford upgrader, which uses hydro-conversion technology to upgrade the bitumen into two streams of synthetic crude oil (premium albian synthetic and albian heavy synthetic) and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to the operator under a long-term contract for use in its refinery adjacent to the upgrading facility. when the aosp is operating at its current capacity, our net bitumen production is 30 mbpd, but operations were curtailed at the scotford upgrader subsequent to the western acquisition date due to a mid-november fire. maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december. net bitumen production averaged 4 mbpd for 2007, based on total volumes from the october 18, 2007 acquisition date over total days in the year. bitumen production averaged 19 mbpd for the post-acquisition period. as of december 31, 2007, our net proved bitumen reserves were estimated to be 421 million barrels. proved reserves can be added as expansions are permitted, funding is approved and certain stipulations of the joint venture agreement are satisfied. in 2006, the first fully-integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved. the phase 1 expansion includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine and expansion of the scotford upgrader, along with construction of common infrastructure sized to support future mining expansions. the aosp phase 1 expansion is under construction and we anticipate that it will be complete in late 2010. work is underway to determine the feasibility of additional aosp expansion projects including pursuing regulatory approvals. the above estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is a forward-looking statement and is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved bitumen reserves estimation process, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved bitumen reserves. operations at the aosp are outside the scope of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no. 25, suspension of certain accounting requirements for oil and gas producing companies (an amendment of fasb statement no. 19), sfas no. 69, disclosures about oil and gas producing activities (an amendment of fasb statements 19, 25, 33 and 39), and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) rule 4-10 of regulation s-x; therefore, bitumen production and reserves are not included in our supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of the aosp expansion project. factors which could affect the project include transportation logistics, availability of material and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks associated with construction projects. refining, marketing and transportation refining we own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1.016 million barrels per day ( mmbpd ) of crude oil. during 2007, our refineries processed 1.010 mmbpd of crude oil and 214 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. the table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our refineries as of december 31, 2007. these capacity amounts increased from 974 mbpd in 2006 due to overall efficiency gains in the operation of the refining units, reflecting the cumulative effect of regular maintenance, capital improvements and other process optimization efforts. 12 table of contents index to financial statements crude oil refining capacity (thousands of barrels per day) garyville, louisiana 256 catlettsburg, kentucky 226 robinson, illinois 204 detroit, michigan 102 canton, ohio 78 texas city, texas 76 st. paul park, minnesota 74 total 1,016 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low-sulfur gasolines and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. we also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. we manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax. our refineries are integrated via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. for example, naphtha may be moved from texas city to robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. also, by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. we completed fluid catalytic cracking unit turnarounds at our catlettsburg, robinson and st. paul park refineries in 2007. the following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years. refined product yields (thousands of barrels per day) 2007 2006 2005 gasoline 646 661 644 distillates 349 323 318 propane 23 23 21 feedstocks and special products 108 107 96 heavy fuel oil 27 26 28 asphalt 86 89 85 total 1,239 1,229 1,192 in 2006, we approved an expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery by 180 mbpd to 436 mbpd, at a projected cost of $3.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). construction commenced in early 2007 and continues on schedule with additional project construction phases commencing in early 2008. we expect to complete the expansion in late 2009. in 2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit, michigan refinery, at a projected cost of $1.9 billion (excluding capitalized interest). this project will enable the refinery to process additional heavy, sour crude oils, including canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 15 percent. construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2008, subject to obtaining necessary environmental permits, and is expected to be completed in late 2010. when completed, these two expansion projects will increase our current total crude oil refining capacity by 19 percent. marketing we are a supplier of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our market area in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. in 2007, our refined products sales volumes totaled 21.6 billion gallons, or 1.410 mmbpd. the average sales price of our refined 13 table of contents index to financial statements products in aggregate was $86.53 per barrel for 2007. the following table sets forth our refined products sales by product group and our average sales price for each of the last three years. refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 2007 2006 2005 gasoline 791 804 836 distillates 377 375 385 propane 23 23 22 feedstocks and special products 103 106 96 heavy fuel oil 29 26 29 asphalt 87 91 87 total (a) 1,410 1,425 1,455 average sales price (dollars per barrel) $86.53 $77.76 $66.42 (a) includes matching buy/sell volumes of 24 mbpd and 77 mbpd in 2006 and 2005. on april 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. this change resulted in lower refined products sales volumes for 2007 and the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under our previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers and sales in the spot market accounted for 69 percent of our refined products sales volumes in 2007. we sold 49 percent of our gasoline volumes and 89 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis. half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics and sulfur are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the united states and canada, with pitch products also being exported worldwide. we market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. our customer base includes approximately 750 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. we have blended ethanol with gasoline for over 15 years and increased our blending program in 2007, in part due to renewable fuel mandates. we blended 41 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2007 and 35 mbpd in both 2006 and 2005. the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and changes in government regulations. we sell reformulated gasoline in parts of our marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; milwaukee, wisconsin and hartford, illinois, and we sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. we also sell biodiesel in minnesota, illinois and kentucky. as of december 31, 2007, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,400 marathon branded-retail outlets located primarily in ohio, michigan, indiana, kentucky and illinois. branded retail outlets are also located in georgia, florida, minnesota, wisconsin, north carolina, tennessee, west virginia, virginia, south carolina, alabama, pennsylvania, and texas. sales to marathon-brand jobbers and dealers accounted for 16 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2007. speedway superamerica llc ( ssa ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and diesel fuel primarily through retail outlets that we operate. sales of refined products through these ssa retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined products sales volumes in 2007. as of december 31, 2007, ssa had 1,636 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names speedway and superamerica. ssa revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.796 billion in 2007, compared with $2.706 billion in 2006. profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. ssa also operates 59 valvoline instant oil change retail outlets located in michigan and northwest ohio. pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ), our joint venture with pilot corporation ( pilot ), is the largest operator of travel centers in the united states with 286 locations in 37 states and canada at december 31, 2007. the travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand-name restaurants at many locations. pilot and marathon each own a 50 percent interest in ptc. 14 table of contents index to financial statements our retail marketing strategy is focused on ssa midwest operations, additional growth of the marathon brand and continued growth for ptc. supply and transportation we obtain most of the crude oil we refine from negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. in 2007, u.s.-sourced crude oil averaged 527 mbpd, or 52 percent, of the crude oil processed at our refineries, including a net 15 mbpd from our production operations included in the e&amp;p segment. canada was the source for 14 percent, or 138 mbpd, of crude oil processed in 2007. other foreign sources supplied 34 percent, or 345 mbpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including 180 mbpd from the middle east. this crude oil was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. the following table provides information on the sources of crude oil for each of the last three years. sources of crude oil refined (thousands of barrels per day) 2007 2006 2005 united states 527 470 447

system of pipelines, terminals and barges to provide crude oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing areas. at december 31, 2007, we owned, leased, operated or held equity method investments in 68 miles of crude oil gathering lines, 3,717 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,860 miles of refined products trunk lines. excluding equity method investees, our owned or operated common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years. pipeline barrels handled (thousands of barrels per day) 2007 2006 2005 crude oil

pipelines: 100 percent ownership of ohio river pipe line llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from kenova, west virginia to columbus, ohio, known as cardinal products pipeline; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana to north muskegon, michigan; 51 percent interest in loop llc ( loop ), the owner and operator of the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at clovelly, louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting gulf coast refineries with the midwest market; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana to patoka, illinois; 15 table of contents index to financial statements 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf of mexico to the midwest; 17 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from clearbrook, minnesota to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our st. paul park, minnesota refinery; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois to toledo, ohio. our 85 owned and operated light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the midwest, upper great plains and southeastern united states. in october 2007, we executed an agreement to purchase four light product terminals in ohio and an ownership interest in a refined product pipeline. this transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2008, pending completion of various pre-closing activities, including obtaining necessary government approvals. our marine transportation operations include 15 towboats and 182 barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers, their tributaries and the intercoastal waterway. we lease and own over 2,500 rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and over 150 tractors and tank trailers. ethanol production in 2007, we acquired a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol facility in clymers, indiana, and continued construction of another 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol facility in greenville, ohio. the greenville plant, in which we own a 50 percent interest, began production in february 2008. both of these facilities are managed by our partner, the andersons, inc. and will enable us to maintain the reliability of a portion of our future ethanol supplies. the above discussion of the rm&amp;t segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the expansion of the garyville refinery and the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. some factors that could affect those projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the above discussion also includes forward-looking statements concerning the purchase of four terminals and an interest in a pipeline which is subject to customary closing conditions and may be affected by the inability or delay in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and other operating and economic considerations. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. lng operations we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. in may 2007, egholdings completed construction of a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum ( mmtpa ) lng production facility on bioko island and delivered its first cargo of lng. lng from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on an fob bioko island basis, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. sales of lng from this production facility totaled 1,464,088 metric tonnes in 2007. in 2007 we completed those portions of the front-end engineering and design ( feed ) required to support the near-term efforts related to a potential second lng production facility on bioko island, equatorial guinea. the scope of the feed work for the potential 4.4 mmtpa lng project included feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil-off gas compression, product transfer to storage and lng product metering. we expect to make progress towards an investment decision in 2008. 16 table of contents index to financial statements we also own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and have an undivided interest in a long-term lease for two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, we have sold our share of the lng plant production under long-term contract with two of japan largest utility companies. this contract continues through march 2009, with 2007 lng deliveries totaling 48 bcf. in january 2007, along with our partner, we filed a request with the doe to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through march 2011. this application has received favorable support from the state of alaska but still requires final doe approval. in april 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes at the elba island, georgia lng regasification terminal pursuant to an lng sales and purchase agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as lng) per year, through march 31, 2021, with a possible extension to november 30, 2023. in september 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years. the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. methanol operations we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ampco owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field. sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1,060,653 metric tonnes in 2007. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the united states. natural gas technology we invest in natural gas technology research, including proprietary gas-to-fuels ( gtf ) technology which offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels while bypassing conventional intermediate synthetic gasification technology. the base patent for this technology was awarded in 2007. we have designed and are constructing a 10-bpd demonstration facility for this technology, with initial startup scheduled for the second half of 2008. expectations for the demonstration plant include the ability to demonstrate operations of the fully integrated process at a practical scale and to measure the conversion efficiencies of the total process, catalyst performance and materials durability. this critical performance data will support scale-up cost estimates for a commercial installation and provide the basis for continued technical developments in this area. in addition to gtf, we continue to evaluate the application of other natural gas technologies, including lng technology enhancements, gas hydrates and gas-to-liquids ( gtl ) technology. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility and expectations for a gtf demonstration facility. factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. factors that could potentially affect the gtf demonstration facility include construction delays, start-up difficulties relating to scale-up in the process and unforeseen difficulties in our testing program related to moving from laboratory to practical scale. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based on industry sources, we rank eighth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2006 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. 17 table of contents index to financial statements we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries in north america. there are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. in addition, not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil. there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2007. we compete in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products. we believe we compete with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; ten refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 275 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as subway . we also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in ptc. our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. the separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. in connection with the separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the separation. the following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and 18 table of contents index to financial statements certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation, united states steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. the financial matters agreement also requires united states steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have us released from our obligations under a guarantee we provided with respect to all of united states steel obligations under a partnership agreement between united states steel, as general partner, and general electric credit corporation of delaware and southern energy clairton, llc, as limited partners. united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. the financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. obligations associated with the separation as of december 31, 2007 see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations associated with the separation of united states steel for a discussion of our obligations associated with the separation. environmental matters the public policy committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. our corporate responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving marathon or any of our properties. legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. the kyoto protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. canadian federal and provincial laws, the u.s. energy independence and security act of 2007, the european union requirements and california laws contain provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions. other climate change legislation and regulations both in the united states and abroad are in various stages of development. our industry, and businesses throughout the united states, are also awaiting the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) actions upon the remand of the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. usepa which could have impacts on a number of air permitting and environmental regulatory programs. our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases. likewise, emissions arise from our rm&amp;t operations, including refining crude oil and transportation crude oil and refined products. although there may be adverse financial impact (including 19 table of contents index to financial statements compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain products) associated with any legislation, regulation, epa or other action, the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to newness of the requirements and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see legal proceedings and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air of particular significance to our refining operations are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in diesel fuel for off-road use. we now plan to spend approximately $350 million between 2006 and 2012 on refinery investments to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use, in compliance with epa regulations. this is a forward-looking statement. some factors (among others) that could potentially affect these compliance costs include final investment decisions, completion of project detailed engineering, construction and start-up activities. further, we previously estimated that we would spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with mobile source air toxics ii regulations relating to benzene. we have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these recently promulgated requirements, but the cost estimates will increase and may be approximately $1 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2008. the cost estimates have increased due to better definition of the projects needed to meet the requirements of the finalized regulations and updated construction cost estimates. the cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as feed work is completed in 2008. the epa is in the process of implementing regulations to address current national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. in connection with these standards, the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, the epa proposed a rule in 2004 called the interstate air quality rule ( iaqr ) that would require significant emissions reductions in numerous states. the final rule, promulgated in 2005, was renamed the clean air interstate rule ( cair ). while the epa expects that states will meet their cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units, states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. our refinery operations are located in affected states and some of these states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair. also, on july 11, 2007, the epa proposed a revised ozone standard. once the revised ozone standard is promulgated, the epa will begin the multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act. we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the states have taken further action and we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the revised ozone standard until the implementing rules are established. 20 table of contents index to financial statements water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of such releases opa-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90 and we have established spill prevention, control and countermeasures ( spcc ) plans for facilities subject to cwa spcc requirements. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. the rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm&amp;t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. ongoing rcra-related costs, however, are not expected to be material. in addition, canada will be implementing a ban on the land application of certain wastes and we are reviewing options to treat or dispose of these wastes consistent with these new restrictions. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. see legal proceedings environmental proceedings other proceedings for a discussion of these sites. other matters the energy policy act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) providing that all gasoline sold in the united states contain a minimum of 4.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006. the rfs increases gradually each year until 2012, when the rfs will be 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel. the epa issued a final rule in may 2007 and the program went into effect on september 1, 2007. we have put the necessary systems in place to track and report our compliance with these requirements. the recently-passed energy independence and security act of 2007 contains multiple rfss. the overall requirement starts with 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel required in 2008 and ramps up to 36.0 billion gallons in 2022. inside of the overall requirement is an advanced biofuels mandate which begins in 2009 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. subsets within the advanced biofuels requirements require 1.0 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel fuel by 2012 and 16.0 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022. the epa has not yet issued a proposal and a final rule to implement this program. this program presents specific challenges in that a refiner like us may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet its obligations to use advanced biofuels and cellulosic ethanol if it cannot produce these fuels itself. we may also experience a decrease in demand of our current refinery-produced petroleum products to the extent they are replaced by advanced biofuels and cellulosic 21 table of contents index to financial statements ethanol and overall demand does not increase to replace this loss. there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the mandates contained in this law and rule, but the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the uncertainty of these measures at this time. we are and will be developing potential strategies for compliance with such requirements. employees we had 29,524 active employees as of december 31, 2007. of that number, 19,578 were employees of ssa, most of who were employed at our retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2009. the same union represents certain hourly employees at our texas city refinery under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2009. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2009 at our st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2010 at our detroit refinery. executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon and their ages as of february 1, 2008, are as

table of contents index to financial statements item 1a. risk factors marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. the following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, as well as refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climatic changes; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain. lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, as well as lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, may reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves. the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group and/or third-party consultants we have retained. the estimates were calculated using liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices in effect as of december 31, 2007, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. any significant future price 24 table of contents index to financial statements changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically recoverable liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; and assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. the proved bitumen reserves information included in this report has also been derived from engineering estimates. reserves related to mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. proved reserves are measured by various testing and sampling methods. bitumen reserves as of december 31, 2007 were estimated by third-party consultants, using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and are subject to many of the same uncertainties discussed above. the estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. future proved bitumen reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and taxation. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production 25 table of contents index to financial statements performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; and the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs. increases in crude oil prices and environmental or other regulations may reduce our refining and wholesale marketing gross margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall rm&amp;t profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. in addition, various regulations have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our refining, marketing and transportation operations, which may reduce our refining and wholesale marketing gross margins. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is reasonably likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. although uncertain, these developments could increase costs or reduce the demand for the products we sell. our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence 26 table of contents index to financial statements or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 59 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2007 was derived from production outside the united states and 73 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2007 were located outside the united states. all of our bitumen production and proved reserves are located in canada. there are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. actions by both the united states and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and, therefore, we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather and labor disputes. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. these hazards could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could materially 27 table of contents index to financial statements reduce our profitability. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities. due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. we may not be successful in integrating and optimizing assets acquired in our acquisition of western . risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to: liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance; greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards, or for investments to improve operating results; difficulties in achieving anticipated operational improvements; diversion of management time and attention from our existing businesses and other priorities; and difficulties in integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of an acquired business into those of our existing operations. such acquisition risks are in addition to any risks inherent in the operations of an oil sands mining business. if ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland. as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland in 2005, marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to ashland interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions. however, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service. if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland. in that event, our indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland. marathon is required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland, which could be material. we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions. under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two baskets, as described below: 28 table of contents index to financial statements basket one this applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland. the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one. upon specified events related to ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two. in addition, basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two. because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland pre-transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two. the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a with and without basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group. thus, if the marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland. because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group tax liability for a particular year. this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation, ashland is required to repay such compensation to marathon. in the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc that was previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of the interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland. under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or, in some jurisdictions, less than fair consideration or valuable consideration; and the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. 29 table of contents index to financial statements in connection with our transactions with ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland shareholders. in order to help establish that ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired. we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to ashland existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) ashland receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) ashland solvency, it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon, united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $533 million as of december 31, 2007, including accrued interest of $8 million. if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel. in that event, our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel. the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. item 1b. unresolved staff comments as of the date of this filing, we have no unresolved comments from the staff of the securities and exchange commission. item 2. properties the location and general character of the principal liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties, oil sands mining properties and facilities, refineries, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of marathon have been described by segment under business. except for oil and gas producing properties and oil sands mines, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in

pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. certain of these matters are included below. the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. however, we believe that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably. natural gas royalty litigation as of december 31, 2005, marathon had been served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and indian lessees violated the false claims act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. a qui tam action is an action in which the plaintiff states that he sues for himself, as well as the state government. the department of justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including marathon. one of the cases, u.s. ex rel jack j. grynberg v. alaska pipeline co., et al, which was primarily a gas measurement case, was dismissed as to marathon on october 20, 2006 on jurisdictional grounds. the second case, u.s. ex rel harrold e. wright v. agip petroleum co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. the wright case is in the discovery phase. in october 2006, marathon was served with an additional qui tam case, filed in the western district of oklahoma, which alleges that marathon violated the false claims act by failing to pay the government past due interest resulting from royalty adjustments for crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon production. the case is styled united states of america ex rel. randy l. little and lanis g. morris v. eni petroleum co., et al. this case asserts that marathon and other defendants are liable for past due interest, penalties, punitive damages and attorneys fees. other than the allegation of a $1,360 underpayment for the month of may 2003, the parties in interest (randy l. little and lanis g. morris) have plead general damages with no other specific amounts against marathon. marathon intends to continue to vigorously defend these cases. powder river basin litigation the u.s. bureau of land management ( blm ) completed multi-year reviews of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin, including those in wyoming. the blm signed a record of decision ( rod ) on april 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane development. plaintiff environmental and other groups filed suit in may 2003 in federal court against the blm to stop coal bed methane development on federal lands in the powder river basin until the blm conducted additional environmental impact studies. marathon intervened as a party in the ongoing litigation before the wyoming federal district court. as these lawsuits to delay energy development in the powder river basin progress through the courts, the wyoming blm continues to process permits to drill under the rod. in the environmental defense fund ( edf ) v. blm case before the federal district court of wyoming, the edf alleged that in 2002, the blm did not sufficiently evaluate the air impacts associated with coal bed natural gas production in the powder river basin, as well as other oil and gas operations in wyoming. marathon and other producers had intervened. in june 2007, the federal district court for the district of wyoming dismissed the edf case (without prejudice as to refiling). 31 table of contents index to financial statements mtbe litigation marathon is a defendant along with many other refining companies in over 50 cases in 12 states alleging methyl tertiary-butyl ether ( mtbe ) contamination in groundwater. all of these cases, after their removal from state to federal court, have been consolidated in a multi-district litigation ( mdl ) in the southern district of new york for pretrial proceedings. the plaintiffs generally are water providers or governmental authorities and they allege that refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing mtbe are collectively liable, under market share and/or other alternative liability theories, for manufacturing a defective product. several of these lawsuits allege contamination in areas that are outside of marathon marketing area. all of the cases seek punitive damages or treble damages under a variety of statutes and theories. in one of the cases, the state of new jersey is seeking natural resources damages allegedly resulting from contamination of groundwater by mtbe. this is the only case in which marathon is a defendant and natural resources damages are sought. marathon stopped producing mtbe at its refineries in october 2002. the mdl court has identified four test cases to proceed ahead of the remaining mdl cases. the first of these test cases (county of suffolk (ny) and suffolk county water authority v. amerada hess corporation, et al.) is scheduled for trial in september 2008. marathon is a defendant in this test case. marathon is engaged in ongoing settlement discussions related to the majority of the cases in which it is defendant, including the suffolk county, new york test case, and such settlement, if any, is not expected to significantly impact marathon consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. product contamination litigation a lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia and alleges that marathon catlettsburg, kentucky refinery sold defective gasoline to wholesalers and retailers, causing permanent damage to storage tanks, dispensers and related equipment, resulting in lost profits, business disruption and personal and real property damages. class action certification was granted in august 2007. in 2002, marathon conducted extensive cleaning operations at affected facilities and denies that any permanent damages resulted from the incident. marathon previously settled with many of the potential class members in this case and intends to vigorously defend this action. environmental proceedings u.s. epa litigation in 2002, marathon and the american petroleum institute ( api ) brought a petition before the u.s. district court for the district of columbia, challenging the u.s. epa 2002 promulgation of new oil spill prevention, countermeasures and control regulations on several grounds; while the dispute has been settled, the one remaining count is over the u.s. epa regulatory definition of waters covered by the clean water act. marathon and api contend that the u.s. epa regulations run contrary to recent decisions of the u.s. supreme court which, in finding federal agencies had gone greatly beyond the intentions of congress as to what waters were covered by the clean water act, narrowed the universe of what waters the federal government, rather than state governments, had jurisdiction to regulate. the case is ongoing with oral arguments to be heard in february 2008. in september 2006, marathon and other oil and gas companies joined the state of wyoming in filing a petition for review against the u.s. epa in the u.s. district court for the district of wyoming. these actions seek a court order mandating the u.s. epa to disapprove montana 2006 amended water quality standards, on grounds that the standards lack sound scientific justification, they are arbitrary and capricious, and were adopted contrary to law. these september 2006 actions have been consolidated with our pending april 2006 action against the u.s. epa in the same court. the water quality amendments at issue, if approved, could require more stringent discharge limits and have the potential to require certain wyoming coal bed methane operations to perform more costly water treatment or inject produced water. approval of these standards could delay or prevent obtaining permits needed to discharge produced water to streams flowing from wyoming into montana. the court has stayed this case while the u.s. epa mediates the matter between montana, wyoming and the northern cheyenne tribe. mediation and settlement talks continue while the litigation is on hold. montana litigation in june 2006, marathon filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in montana state district court against the montana board of environmental review ( mber ) and the montana department of environmental quality, 32 table of contents index to financial statements seeking to set aside and declare invalid certain regulations of the mber that single out the coal bed natural gas industry and a few streams in eastern montana for excessively severe and unjustified restrictions for surface water discharges of produced water from coal bed methane operations. none of the streams affected by the regulations suffers impairment from coal bed natural gas discharges. the court, in deferring to the mber discretion, upheld the mber regulations. this decision is now being appealed to the montana supreme court and does not impact marathon operations in the meanwhile. wyoming proceedings the wyoming environmental quality council ( eqc ), which oversees the state department of environmental quality ( deq ), has before it an administrative petition filed by the powder river basis resource council in 2006 seeking new water quality sulfate and barium standards for coal bed methane produced water and a requirement that all such water be beneficially reused. the petition seeks to expand the authority of the deq to regulate the quantity of water discharges. it would narrow the definition of required beneficial use discharges and would impose stricter effluent standards for discharged water. the eqc is also considering adoption of a rule which would impose more stringent water quality limits as to produced water discharges that come from any new coal bed methane or conventional oil and gas operations. the deq made this proposal citing a statutory directive that all waters that are suitable for agriculture may not be degraded. marathon contends that its waters as currently regulated are beneficial to crops and livestock, rather than being a potential threat. the eqc would have to decide how stringent a water quality standard it would adopt for new discharges. in response to the governor of wyoming veto of a state agency adoption of a rule that would allow the deq to regulate the quantity of coal bed methane water discharges, an activist group has sued in state court to overturn the veto. in june 2007, marathon and another producer filed a motion to intervene. the deq has begun issuing renewal water discharge and other permits with stringent limits based on its agricultural use policy rather than upon any regulation. the permits could require more costly water treatment or injection. marathon is appealing every permit issued in this way. in 2007, the state court dismissed the activist group lawsuit, and its time for appeal has expired. other environmental proceedings the following is a summary of proceedings involving marathon that were pending or contemplated as of december 31, 2007 under federal and state environmental laws. except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management belief set forth in the first paragraph under legal proceedings above takes such matters into account. claims under cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the clean-up of various waste disposal and other sites. cercla is intended to facilitate the clean-up of hazardous substances without regard to fault. potentially responsible parties ( prps ) for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. liability is strict and can be joint and several. because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean-up costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with cercla. the projections of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects provided in the following paragraphs are forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for and/or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. as of december 31, 2007, marathon had been identified as a prp at a total of ten cercla waste sites. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for clean-up and remediation costs in connection with five of these sites will be under $1 million per site (with four of these five sites being under $100,000 each). as to the remaining five sites, marathon believes that its liability for clean-up and remediation costs in connection with two of these sites will be under $4 million per site. marathon is not far enough along in the process to determine the cost for the remaining three sites, but two of the sites may be $1 million to $2 million or more each and the other may be under $1 million. in addition, there are two sites for which marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a prp under cercla, but for which sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. 33 table of contents index to financial statements there are also 119 sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, marathon believes that its liability for clean-up and remediation costs in connection with 17 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, that 54 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site and that 19 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site. nine sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site and there are six sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs. there are 14 other sites for which ashland retains responsibility to marathon for remediation, subject to caps and other requirements contained in the agreements with ashland related to marathon acquisition of ashland minority interest in mpc in 2005. marathon estimates that it will be responsible for nearly $8 million in remediation costs at these sites which will not be reimbursed by ashland, and marathon has included this amount in its accrued environmental remediation liabilities. there is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the michigan department of environmental quality ( mdeq ) at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near muskegon, michigan. during the next 29 years, marathon anticipates spending approximately $6 million in remediation costs at this site. in 2008, interim remediation measures will continue to occur and appropriate site characterization and risk-based assessments necessary for closure will be refined and may change the estimated future expenditures for this site. the closure strategy being developed for this site and ongoing work at the site are subject to approval by the mdeq. expenditures for remedial measures in 2007 and 2006 were $524,000 and $461,000, with expenditures for remedial measures in 2008 expected to be approximately $2 million. mpc has had a pending enforcement matter with the illinois environmental protection agency and the illinois attorney general office since 2002 concerning self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the robinson, illinois refinery. during 2001, marathon entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act and other violations with the epa covering all of its refineries. the settlement committed marathon to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to its refineries over approximately an eight-year period. in addition, marathon has been working on certain agreed-upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations and these have been substantially completed. as part of this consent decree, marathon was required to conduct evaluations of its refinery benzene waste air pollution programs. these evaluations resulted in disclosure of benzene waste compliance issues at the canton and catlettsburg refineries. the u.s. department of justice has informed marathon that it will seek several hundred thousand dollars of civil penalties (potentially to include supplemental environmental projects) for these matters. no formal enforcement action has been brought but marathon will attempt to resolve these matters in 2008. the u.s. occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) has announced a national emphasis program where it plans to inspect most of the domestic oil refinery locations. the inspections began in 2007 and focus on compliance with the osha process safety management requirements. osha conducted an inspection at the canton refinery over several months in 2007. this inspection resulted in an informal settlement agreement with osha in december 2007 under which a penalty of $321,500 was paid and marathon agreed to various abatement measures. osha is scheduled to conduct an inspection of the robinson refinery in the first quarter of 2008 and may conduct inspections of other marathon refineries during that year. further enforcement actions by osha may result from these inspections. sec investigation relating to equatorial guinea by letter dated july 15, 2004, the sec notified marathon that it was conducting an inquiry into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea, or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea. this inquiry followed an investigation and public hearing conducted by the u.s. senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, which reviewed the transactions of various foreign governments, including those of equatorial guinea, with riggs bank. the investigation and hearing also reviewed the operations of u.s. oil and gas companies, including marathon, in equatorial guinea. there was no finding in the subcommittee report that marathon violated the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or any other applicable laws or regulations. marathon voluntarily produced documents requested by the sec in that inquiry. on august 1, 2005, marathon received a subpoena issued by the sec pursuant to a formal order of investigation requiring the production of the documents that had already been produced or that were in the process of being identified and produced in response to the sec prior requests, and requesting the production of additional materials. marathon has been and intends to continue cooperating with the sec in this investigation. 34 table of contents index to

effective april 1, 2006, marathon changed its accounting for matching buy/sell transactions. this change had no effect on income from continuing operations or net income, but the revenues and cost of revenues recognized after april 1, 2006 are less than the amounts that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 36 table of contents index to financial statements item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration, production and marketing of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; mining, extraction and transportation of bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrading of the bitumen for the production and marketing of synthetic crude oil and by-products; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states; and worldwide marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, and development of other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under business, risk factors, selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data. certain sections of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. these statements typically contain words such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, targets, plans, projects, could, may, should, would or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings. as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, effective may 1, 2007, we no longer consolidate egholdings. our investment is accounted for prospectively using the equity method of accounting. unless specifically noted, amounts presented for the integrated gas segment for periods prior to may 1, 2007 include amounts related to the minority interests. unless specifically noted, amounts for the rm&amp;t segment include the 38 percent interest in mpc held by ashland prior our acquisition of that interest on june 30, 2005. overview acquisition of western oil sands inc. on october 18, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of western for cash and securities of $5.833 billion. western debt was $1.063 billion at closing. western primary asset was a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp, which is located in the province of alberta, canada. the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include western results from october 18, 2007. western oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment. exploration and production exploration and production segment revenues correlate with prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas we produce. higher crude oil prices in 2007 primarily reflected increasing global demand and ongoing concerns about supplies of crude oil from oil-producing countries. during 2007, the average spot price per barrel for west texas intermediate ( wti ), a benchmark crude oil, was $72.41, up from an average of $66.25 in 2006, and ended the year at $95.98. during 2007, the average spot price per barrel for dated brent ( brent ), an international benchmark crude oil, was $72.39, up from an average of $65.14 in 2006, and ended the year at $96.02. the differential between wti and brent average prices narrowed to $0.02 in 2007 from $1.11 in 2006. our domestic crude oil production is on average heavier and higher in sulfur content than light sweet wti. heavier and higher sulfur crude oil (commonly referred to as heavy sour crude oil) sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil. our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the brent crude oil benchmark. natural gas prices were lower in 2007 than in 2006. a significant portion of our u.s. lower 48 states natural gas production is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. the average henry hub first-of-month price index was $0.38 per thousand cubic feet ( mcf ) lower in 2007 than the 2006 average. our natural gas prices in alaska are largely contractual. natural gas sales there are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first 37 table of contents index to financial statements quarters. our other major natural gas-producing regions are europe and equatorial guinea, where large portions of our natural gas are sold at contractual prices, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. the significant increase in sales of natural gas in equatorial guinea, at a fixed price, to the new lng production facility discussed below contributed to the decrease in our average international realized natural gas prices. for information on commodity price risk management, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. e&amp;p segment income during 2007 was down 14 percent from 2006, primarily as a result of lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and natural gas realizations and increased exploration expenses, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations and natural gas sales volumes. oil sands mining our oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations were acquired in october 2007 as part of our acquisition of western and are comprised of a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp, which includes the operating muskeg river mine and the scotford upgrader, located in alberta, canada. the bitumen production from the muskeg river mine is taken by pipeline to the scotford upgrader, which uses hydro-conversion technology to upgrade the bitumen into a range of high-quality, synthetic crude oils. when the aosp is operating at current capacity, our net bitumen production is 30 mbpd, but operations were curtailed at the scotford upgrader subsequent to the western acquisition date due to a mid-november fire. maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december. oil sands mining segment revenues correlate with prevailing prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil we produce and the cost of materials and supplies input during the upgrading process also correlate with market prices for commodities. the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred when the aosp is in full operation continue during any production downtime. this had a negative effect on segment income subsequent to the acquisition date as a result of the downtime associated with the fire and maintenance activities discussed above. for information on commodity price risk management, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. refining, marketing and transportation rm&amp;t segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, refinery throughputs, retail marketing gross margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations. the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. as a result, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin could be adversely affected by rising crude oil and other charge and blendstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. the crack spread, which is generally a measure of the difference between market prices for gasoline and distillate and crude oil costs, is a commonly used industry indicator of refining margins. in addition to changes in the crack spread, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks we process, the selling prices we realize for all the refined products we sell, the cost of purchased products, our level of manufacturing costs and the impact of commodity derivative instruments we use in our rm&amp;t operations primarily to mitigate price risk between the time that crude oil purchases are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. we process significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances our profitability compared to certain of our competitors as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. over the last three years, 58 percent of the crude oil throughput at our refineries has been sour crude oil. as one of the largest u.s. producers of asphalt, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is also impacted by the selling price of asphalt. sales of asphalt increase during the highway construction season in our market area, which is typically in the second and third quarters of each year. the selling price of asphalt is dependent on the cost of crude oil, the price of alternative paving materials and the level of construction activity in both the private and public sectors. we supplement our refining production by purchasing gasolines and distillates in the spot market to resell at wholesale. in addition, we purchase ethanol for blending with gasoline. our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by the cost of these 38 table of contents index to financial statements purchased products, which varies with available supply and demand. finally, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by changes in manufacturing costs from period to period, which are primarily driven by the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas used for plant fuel. our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in our various marketing areas, the availability of refined product supply, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and expectations regarding the adequacy of refined products, ethanol and raw material supplies. our 2007 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin was the key driver of the 26 percent decrease in rm&amp;t segment income when compared to 2006. the average refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon decreased to 18.48 cents in 2007 from 22.88 cents in 2006, primarily due to the significant and rapid increases in crude oil prices during 2007 and lagging wholesale price realizations. for information on commodity price risk management, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. our seven refineries have an aggregate refining capacity of 1.016 mmbpd of crude oil. during 2007, our refineries processed 1.010 mmbpd of crude oil and 214 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of the refined products, including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes, also plays an important part in rm&amp;t segment profitability. factors affecting our retail gasoline and distillate gross margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact driving conditions. the gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets tends to be less volatile than the gross margin from the retail sale of gasoline and distillates. factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of economic activity in our marketing areas. the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through the pipelines. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. the seasonal pattern for distillates is the reverse of this, helping to level overall variability on an annual basis. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. integrated gas our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand. our production facility in equatorial guinea that commenced operations during 2007 is a key component of this strategy. our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, primarily in the united states, europe and west africa. methanol spot pricing is volatile largely because global methanol demand is 38 million tonnes and any major unplanned shutdown of or addition to production capacity can have a significant impact on the supply-demand balance. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of integrated gas projects, including natural gas technology research. 39 table of contents index to financial statements 2007 highlights we acquired western and, as a result, added 421 million barrels of net proved bitumen reserves. we announced the droshky discovery and two appraisal sidetrack wells in the gulf of mexico and eight discoveries in deepwater angola and continued our alvheim/vilje and neptune development projects. we added net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves of 88 million boe, while producing 125 million boe during 2007. over the past three years, we have added net proved reserves of 516 million boe, excluding dispositions of 46 million boe, while producing 383 million boe. we achieved record refinery crude oil and total throughput and strengthened our rm&amp;t business by: commencing construction of the garyville, louisiana, refinery expansion; approving a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at the detroit, michigan, refinery; and continuing our investment in transportation and storage assets to increase our ethanol blending capacity throughout our terminal network and in ethanol production assets to further ensure the security of our supply of ethanol. we completed construction of the equatorial guinea lng production facility ahead of schedule and on budget and commenced operations. we focused on total shareholder return by: repurchasing 16 million common shares in 2007, bringing the total repurchases under our $5 billion program to 58 million common shares through 2007 at a cost of $2.520 billion; increasing our quarterly dividend per share by 20 percent ; and completing a two-for-one common stock split. critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, economic and political conditions change. during 2007, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 4 million boe (less than 1 percent of the beginning-of-the-year reserves estimate). positive revisions of 32 million boe were partially offset by 28 million boe in negative revisions. 40 table of contents index to financial statements our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates prepared by these teams are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10(a)(2),(3) and (4) of regulation s-x and sfas no. 25, suspension of certain accounting requirements for oil and gas producing companies (an amendment of fasb statement no. 19), and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of sfas no. 69, disclosures about oil and gas producing activities (an amendment of fasb statements 19, 25, 33 and 39). reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by members of our corporate reserves group. any change to proved reserves estimates in excess of 2.5 million boe on a total-field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer. the corporate reserves group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions. third-party consultants are engaged to prepare independent reserve estimates for fields that rank in the top 80 percent of our total reserves over a rolling four-year period. the volumes independently estimated are targeted to total at least 80 percent of our total reserves at the beginning of the fourth year. we met this goal for the four-year period ended december 31, 2007. for 2006 and thereafter, we established a tolerance level of 10 percent for third-party reserve estimates such that the third-party consultants discontinue their estimation activities once their results are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. if, after this re-examination, the third-party consultants cannot arrive at estimates within our tolerance, we would adjust our reserve estimates as necessary. this independent third-party reserve estimation process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2007, 2006 or 2005. the reserves of the alba field in equatorial guinea comprise 39 percent of our total proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2007. the reserves of the next five largest asset groups the waha concessions in libya, the alvheim/vilje development offshore norway, the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom, the oregon basin field in the rocky mountain area of the united states and the petronius development on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830 in the gulf of mexico comprise 31 percent of our total proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. depreciation and depletion of producing liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved developed reserves. the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant. on average, a five percent increase in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.66 per barrel, which would increase pretax income by approximately $85 million annually, based on 2007 production. on average, a five percent decrease in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.81 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $104 million annually, based on 2007 production. proved bitumen reserves we acquired a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp in alberta, canada with the acquisition of western in october 2007. oil sands mining operations at the aosp are outside the scope of sfas nos. 25 and 69 and sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x; therefore, bitumen production and reserves are not included in our supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. the estimated amount of proved bitumen reserves affects the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income. the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets used in allocating the western acquisition purchase price and in testing oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets for impairment also rely, in part, on estimates of proved bitumen reserves. reserves related to oil sands mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. proved bitumen reserves as of december 31, 2007 were estimated using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. proved bitumen reserves were estimated at october 18, 2007, the date of the western acquisition, based on the third-party consultants estimate as of december 31, 2006, adjusted for production through the acquisition date. depreciation and depletion of most oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved bitumen reserves. a five percent 41 table of contents index to financial statements increase in estimated bitumen reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.70 per barrel, and a five percent decrease in estimated bitumen reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.77 per barrel. fair value estimates we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record non-exchange traded derivative instruments. other items that require fair value estimates include asset retirement obligations, guarantee obligations and stock-based compensation. under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. during 2007, we made a significant acquisition with an aggregate purchase price of $5.833 billion that was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information on this acquisition. we did not make any significant acquisitions in 2006. as of december 31, 2007, our recorded goodwill was $2.899 billion. such goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. the fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition and to test goodwill for impairment are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future revenues and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for e&amp;p assets, expansion project level for oil sands mining assets, refinery and associated distribution system level or pipeline system level for refining and transportation assets, or site level for retail stores. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. estimating the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas producing asset groups and our oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets requires assumptions about matters such as future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen, expected timing of production and the political environment in the host country. an impairment of any of our large oil and gas producing properties or our oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. we evaluate our unproved property investment for impairment based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an undiscounted future net cash flow approach. information such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and/or future plans to develop acreage are also considered. the expected future cash flows from our rm&amp;t assets require assumptions about matters such as future refined product prices, future crude oil and other feedstock costs, estimated remaining lives of the assets and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets existing service potential. impairment charges have not been significant, totaling $19 million and $25 million in 2007 and 2006, while there were no impairment charges in 2005. we record all derivative instruments at fair value. we have two long-term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. these contracts expire in september 2009. these contracts were entered into in the early 1990s in support of our investments in the east brae field and the sage pipeline. the contract price is reset annually in october and is indexed to a basket of costs of living and 42 table of contents index to financial statements energy commodity indices for the previous twelve months. consequently, the prices under these contracts do not track forward natural gas prices. the fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price to the expected sales volumes under these contracts for the next 18 months. beginning in the second quarter of 2008, the remaining contract terms will be less than 18 months and therefore the forecasted valuation period will be reduced accordingly. adjustments to the fair value of these contracts result in non-cash charges or credits to income from operations. the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price may fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect income from operations. in 2007, 2006 and 2005, non-cash losses of $232 million, gains of $454 million and losses of $386 million related to changes in the fair values of these contracts were recognized in income from operations. these effects are primarily due to the u.k. 18-month forward natural gas price curve strengthening 45 percent in 2007, weakening 44 percent in 2006 and strengthening 90 percent in 2005. expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. as of december 31, 2007, we reported total deferred tax assets of $2.589 billion, which represented gross assets of $3.590 billion net of valuation allowances of $1.001 billion. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, we consider proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and natural gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies in the event the forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plans and our unfunded u.s. retiree health care plan due to the different projected liability durations of 8 years and 12 years. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary discount rate modeling tool. this tool applies a yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical aa yield curve. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual discount rates from 1.5 to 30 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized 43 table of contents index to financial statements rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. each issue is required to have at least $150 million par value outstanding. the top quartile bonds are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield curve. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the u.s. funded pension plans and 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent debt securities for the international funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our assumptions are compared to those of peer companies and to historical returns for reasonableness and appropriateness. compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. note 24 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense for 2007, 2006 and 2005, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the balance sheets as of december 31, 2007 and 2006. of the assumptions used to measure the december 31, 2007 obligations and estimated 2008 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. a 0.25 percent decrease in the discount rates of 6.3 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 6.6 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $95 million and $23 million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $14 million and $1 million. in 2006, we made certain plan design changes which included an update of the mortality table used in the plans definition of actuarial equivalence and lump sum calculations and a 20 percent retiree cost of living adjustment for annuitants. this change increased our benefit obligations by $117 million. in 2005, we decreased our retirement age assumption by two years and also increased our lump sum election rate from 90 percent to 96 percent based on changing trends in our experience. this change increased our benefit obligations by $109 million. there were no plan design changes in 2007. contingent liabilities we accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. for instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. 44 table of contents index to financial statements management discussion and analysis of results of operations change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions matching buy/sell transactions arise from arrangements in which we agree to buy a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or refined product to be delivered to a specified location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of the same commodity at a specified location to the same counterparty. prior to april 1, 2006, all matching buy/sell transactions were recorded as separate sale and purchase transactions, or on a gross basis. effective for contracts entered into or modified on or after april 1, 2006, the income effects of matching buy/sell transactions are reported in cost of revenues, or on a net basis. transactions under contracts entered into before april 1, 2006 will continue to be reported on a gross basis. this accounting change had no effect on net income but the amounts of revenues and cost of revenues recognized after april 1, 2006 are less than the amounts that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, this accounting change impacts the comparability of certain operating statistics, most notably refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon. while this change does not have an effect on the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (the numerator for calculating this statistic), sales volumes (the denominator for calculating this statistic) recognized after april 1, 2006 are less than the amount that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices because volumes related to matching buy/sell transactions under contracts entered into or modified on or after april 1, 2006 have been excluded. accordingly, the resulting refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon statistic will be higher than that same statistic calculated from amounts determined under previous accounting practices. as a result, this accounting change impacts the comparability of revenues, cost of revenues and the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon for all periods presented. consolidated results of operations revenues for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table. (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 e&amp;p $ 9,155 $ 9,010 $ 8,009 osm 221 rm&amp;t 56,075 55,941 56,003 ig 218 179 236 segment revenues 65,669 65,130 64,248 elimination of intersegment revenues (885 ) (688 ) (876 ) gain (loss) on long-term u.k. gas contracts (232 ) 454 (386 ) total revenues $ 64,552 $ 64,896 $ 62,986 items included in both revenue and costs and expenses: consumer excise taxes on petroleum products and merchandise $ 5,163 $ 4,979 $ 4,715 matching crude oil and refined product buy/sell transactions settled in cash: e&amp;p 16 123 rm&amp;t 127 5,441 12,513 total buy/sell transactions included in revenues $ 127 $ 5,457 $ 12,636 e&amp;p segment revenues increased $145 million in 2007 from 2006 and $1.001 billion in 2006 from 2005. the 2007 increase was primarily related to increased international crude oil marketing activities. higher liquid hydrocarbon realized prices were not sufficient to offset the impact of sales volume declines as illustrated in the table below. both liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes from domestic operations decreased in 2007 primarily due to normal production declines in the gulf of mexico and permian basin, while international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were lower primarily because our libya sales returned to normal levels compared to 2006, which included volumes owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations there. while international natural gas sales volumes increased, the majority of the increase was due to the start-up of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea in the second quarter of 2007. this increase in fixed-price sales volumes also contributed to the decline in our average international natural gas realizations. 45 table of contents index to financial statements the 2006 increase was primarily in international revenues due to higher realized liquid hydrocarbon prices and sales volumes as illustrated in the table below. the largest liquid hydrocarbon sales volume increase was in libya, where the first crude oil sales occurred in the first quarter of 2006 and where sales volumes averaged 54 mbpd in 2006, including a total of 8 mbpd that were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations there. revenues from domestic operations were flat from year to year. an 8 percent decrease in domestic net natural gas sales volumes, primarily as the result of the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico ceasing production in early 2006, offset the benefit of higher liquid hydrocarbon prices in 2006. e&amp;p operating statistics 2007 2006 2005 net liquid hydrocarbon sales (thousands of barrels per day) (a) united states 64 76 76 europe (b) 33 35 36 africa (b) 100 112 52 total international (b) 133 147 88 worldwide continuing operations 197 223 164 discontinued operations (c) 12 27 worldwide 197 235 191 net natural gas sales (millions of cubic feet per day) (d)(e) united states 477 532 578 europe 216 243 262 africa 232 72 92 total international 448 315 354 worldwide 925 847 932 total worldwide sales (thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day) continuing operations 351 365 319 discontinued operations 12 27 worldwide 351 377 346 average realizations (f) liquid hydrocarbons (dollars per barrel) united states $ 60.15 $ 54.41 $ 45.41 europe 70.31 64.02 52.99 africa 66.09 59.83 46.27 total international 67.15 60.81 49.04 worldwide continuing operations 64.86 58.63 47.35 discontinued operations 38.38 33.47 worldwide $ 64.86 $ 57.58 $ 45.42 natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) united states $ 5.73 $ 5.76 $ 6.42 europe 6.53 6.74 5.70 africa 0.25 0.27 0.25 total international 3.28 5.27 4.28 worldwide $ 4.54 $ 5.58 $ 5.61 (a) includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.

included derivative losses of $15 million in 2007 and gains of $25 million and $7 million in 2006 and 2005. excluded from e&amp;p segment revenues were losses of $232 million in 2007, gains of $454 million in 2006 and losses of $386 million in 2005 related to long-term natural gas sales contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. osm segment revenues totaled $221 million in 2007, reflecting sales for the period subsequent to the october 18, 2007, western acquisition date. revenues during this period were reduced by $53 million of unrealized 46 table of contents index to financial statements losses on derivative instruments held by western at the acquisition date intended to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude oil. revenues were also negatively impacted by a mid-november fire and the subsequent curtailment of operations at the scotford upgrader. maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjuction with the necessary repairs. the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december. rm&amp;t segment revenues increased $134 million in 2007 from 2006 and decreased $62 million in 2006 from 2005. the portion of rm&amp;t revenues reported for matching buy/sell transactions decreased $5.314 billion and $7.072 billion in the same periods. the decrease in revenues from matching buy/sell transactions was a result of the change in accounting for these transactions effective april 1, 2006, discussed above. excluding matching buy/sell transactions, 2007 revenues increased primarily as a result of higher refined product prices. the 2006 increase primarily reflected higher refined product prices and sales volumes. income from equity method investments increased $154 million in 2007 from 2006 and $126 million in 2006 from 2005. income from the lng production facility in equatorial guinea accounts for most of the increase for 2007, as it began operations in may 2007 and delivered 24 cargoes during the year. income from our lpg operations, also in equatorial guinea, increased in 2006 due to higher sales volumes as a result of the plant expansions completed in 2005. cost of revenues increased $6.689 billion in 2007 from 2006 and $4.609 billion in 2006 from 2005. in both periods the increases were primarily in the rm&amp;t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil, refinery charge and blend stocks and purchased refined products. the increases in both periods were also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses, primarily planned maintenance projects, or turnarounds, in 2007 and higher contract services and labor costs in 2006. purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $5.247 billion in 2007 from 2006 and $6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 as a result of the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above. depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $95 million in 2007 from 2006 and $215 million in 2006 from 2005. the increase in 2007 primarily relates to the addition of the oil sands mining assets recorded as a result of the western acquisition, increased accretion of asset retirement obligations associated with international e&amp;p properties and increased depreciation related to various refinery improvements in 2006 and 2007, such as our low-sulfur diesel projects. the increase in 2006 included higher rm&amp;t depreciation expense primarily as a result of the increase in asset value recorded for our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30, 2005, and the completion of the detroit refinery expansion in the fourth quarter of 2005. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $99 million in 2007 from 2006 and $73 million in 2006 from 2005. the 2007 and 2006 increases were primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the years as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity. contingency accruals also contributed to the 2007 increase. partially offsetting the 2006 increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense. exploration expenses increased $89 million in 2007 from 2006 and $148 million in 2006 from 2005. exploration expenses related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $233 million, $166 million and $111 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005. in 2006, exploration expenses also included $47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia. net interest and other financial income or costs reflected $41 million of income for 2007, a favorable change of $4 million from 2006. net interest and other financial income or costs reflected $37 million of income for 2006, a favorable change of $183 million from $146 million of expense in 2005. the favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances, foreign currency exchange gains, adjustments to interest on tax issues and greater capitalized interest. included in net interest and other financial income or costs are foreign currency transaction gains of $2 million and $16 million for 2007 and 2006, and losses of $17 million for 2005. gain on foreign currency derivative instruments in 2007 represents gains on foreign currency derivative instruments entered to limit our exposure to changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate related to the cash portion of the purchase price for western. these derivative instruments were settled on october 17, 2007. minority interest in income of mpc was eliminated subsequent to our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30, 2005. 47 table of contents index to financial statements provision for income taxes decreased $1.121 billion in 2007 from 2006 and increased $2.308 billion in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the $2.130 billion decrease and the $4.259 billion increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes. the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2007 was primarily a result of the $193 million benefit of applying the canadian income tax rate reductions enacted subsequent to our acquisition of western to the applicable net deferred tax liabilities. these tax rates will decrease from 32 percent to 25 percent by 2012. the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2006 was primarily a result of the income taxes related to our libya operations, where the statutory income tax rate is in excess of 90 percent. the following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for continuing operations for 2007, 2006 and 2005. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 2007 2006 2005 statutory u.s. income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 9.8 10.1 (0.8 ) state and local income taxes, net

disposal of $8 million and $243 million are also included in discontinued operations for 2007 and 2006. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2005 was an unfavorable effect of $19 million, net of taxes of $12 million, representing the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation ( fin ) no. 47, accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. 143, as of december 31, 2005. segment results as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we sold our russian oil exploration and production businesses during 2006. the activities of these operations have been reported as discontinued operations and therefore are excluded from segment results for all periods presented. segment income or loss for each of the last three years is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table. (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 e&amp;p united states $ 623 $ 873 $ 983 international 1,106 1,130 904 e&amp;p segment income 1,729 2,003 1,887 osm (63 ) rm&amp;t 2,077 2,795 1,628 ig 132 16 55 segment income 3,875 4,814 3,570 items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes: corporate and other unallocated items (104 ) (212 ) (377 ) gain (loss) on long-term u.k. natural gas contracts (a) (118 ) 232 (223 ) gain on foreign currency derivative instruments 112 deferred income taxes tax legislation changes 193 21 15 other adjustments (b) 93 gain on dispositions 8 274 loss on early extinguishment of debt (10 ) (22 ) discontinued operations 34 45 gain on sale of minority interests in eg holdings 21 cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (19 ) net income $ 3,956 $ 5,234 $ 3,032 (a) amounts relate to long-term natural gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments and recorded at fair value. see critical accounting estimates fair value estimates. (b) other deferred tax adjustments in 2006 represent a benefit recorded for cumulative income tax basis differences associated with prior periods. 48 table of contents index to financial statements united states e&amp;p income decreased $250 million, or 29 percent, in 2007 from 2006. this was the result of a $394 million decline in pretax income, while the effective income tax rate remained unchanged at 36 percent. the decrease in pretax income was primarily due to the revenue decline discussed above. in addition, exploration expenses were $105 million, higher in 2007 than in 2006, primarily as a result of expensing non-commercial wells on the flathead prospect in the gulf of mexico in 2007. u.s. e&amp;p income decreased $110 million in 2006 from 2005. this was the result of a $182 million decline in pretax income, partially offset by a slight reduction in the effective income tax rate from 37 percent in 2005 to 36 percent in 2006. the decrease in pretax income was due to increases in variable production costs, exploration expenses, property impairments and depreciation, depletion and amortization. exploration expenses in 2006 were $51 million higher than in 2005, with half of the increase related to a gulf of mexico exploratory dry well. as discussed above, u.s. e&amp;p revenues were flat from 2005 to 2006. international e&amp;p income decreased $24 million in 2007 from 2006, reflecting a decrease in pretax income of $79 million and an effective income tax rate of 62 percent in both years. the revenue decrease associated with lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes discussed above had the most significant impact on pretax income. international e&amp;p income increased $226 million, or 25 percent, in 2006 from 2005, reflecting an increase in pretax income of $1.639 billion and an increase in the effective tax rate from 34 percent in 2005 to 62 percent in 2006. the revenue increase discussed above, primarily related to higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations and higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in libya, had the most significant impact on pretax income. depreciation, depletion and amortization and other variable costs increased with increased production to partially offset the revenue increase. exploration expenses also increased $97 million in 2006 compared to 2005. exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs was $68 million in 2006 and $44 million in 2005. also included in 2006 exploration expense was $47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia. the increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of the income taxes related to our libya operations, where the statutory income tax rate is in excess of 90 percent, and the 2006 increase in the u.k. supplemental corporation tax rate from 10 percent to 20 percent. osm segment loss totaled $63 million in 2007, reflecting results for the period subsequent to the october 18, 2007, western acquisition date. this loss includes a $39 million after-tax unrealized loss on derivative instruments held by western at the acquisition date intended to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude oil. segment income was also impacted by a mid-november fire and subsequent curtailment of operations at the scotford upgrader. maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december. rm&amp;t segment income decreased $718 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily a result of a decrease in our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon from 22.88 cents in 2006 to 18.48 cents in 2007. though the market-based crack spreads for 2007 were stronger than in 2006, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin declined primarily due to the significant and rapid increase in our crude oil costs during 2007, including the impact of derivatives, and lagging wholesale price realizations. our refining and marketing wholesale gross margin was further reduced by higher manufacturing costs related to planned maintenance at several refineries. in addition to the lower refining and wholesale gross margin, segment income was impacted by higher operating and administrative expenses. rm&amp;t segment income increased $1.167 billion in 2006 from 2005, including the benefit from the 38 percent minority interest in mpc that we acquired on june 30, 2005. pretax income increased $1.802 billion in 2006 from 2005. the pretax earnings reduction related to the minority interest was $376 million in 2005. the key driver of the increase in rm&amp;t pretax income was our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon which averaged 22.88 cents in 2006 compared to 15.82 cents in 2005. the increase in the margin for 2006 reflected wider crack spreads, improved refined product sales realizations, the favorable effects of our ethanol blending program and increased refinery throughputs. included in the refining and wholesale marketing gross margins were pretax losses of $899 million in 2007, gains of $400 million in 2006 and losses of $238 million in 2005 related to commodity derivative instruments. for a more complete explanation of our strategies to manage market risk related to commodity prices, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. we averaged 1.010 mmbpd of crude oil throughput in 2007, 980 mbpd in 2006 and 973 mbpd in 2005. our reported crude oil refining capacity increased to 1.016 mmbpd in 2007 from 974 mbpd in 2006 due to overall 49 table of contents index to financial statements efficiency gains in the operation of the refining units, reflecting the cumulative effect of regular maintenance, capital improvements and other process optimization efforts. the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the rm&amp;t segment for each of the last three years. rm&amp;t operating statistics 2007 2006 2005 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1848 $ 0.2288 $ 0.1582 refined product sales volumes (thousands of

purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. (b) total average daily volumes of refined product sales to wholesale, branded and retail customers. (c) on april 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell transactions as a result of a new accounting standard. this change resulted in lower refined product sales volumes for 2007 and the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under our previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. ig segment income increased $116 million in 2007 from 2006 and decreased $39 million in 2006 from 2005. during 2007, construction of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea was completed ahead of schedule and on budget. the increase in 2007 segment income over the previous year was largely due to the facility beginning operations in may 2007 and delivering 24 cargoes during the year. additionally, income from our equity method investment in ampco was higher in 2007 on increased methanol production due to plant downtime in 2006 and higher realized prices in 2007. in 2006, a $17 million pretax loss was recognized as a result of the renegotiation of a technology agreement and income from our equity method investment in ampco was lower due to plant downtime during a planned turnaround and subsequent compressor repair, partially offset by higher realized methanol prices. the provision for income taxes also increased $15 million in 2006. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity financial condition net property, plant and equipment as of the end of the last two years is summarized in the following table. (in millions) 2007 2006 e&amp;p united states $ 4,248 $ 3,636 international 5,864 4,879 total e&amp;p 10,112 8,515 osm 6,671 rm&amp;t 7,500 6,452 ig 31 1,378 corporate 361 308 total $ 24,675 $ 16,653 net property, plant and equipment increased $8.022 billion in 2007 primarily due to the addition of the oil sands mining assets recorded as a result of the western acquisition. the decrease in integrated gas segment assets is due to the deconsolidation of eg holdings discussed above. cash flows net cash provided from operating activities totaled $6.521 billion in 2007, compared to $5.488 billion in 2006 and $4.738 billion in 2005. the $1.033 billion increase in 2007 primarily reflects working capital changes partially offset by lower net income. the $750 million increase in 2006 primarily reflects the impact of higher net income, partially offset by contributions of $635 million to our defined benefit pension plans and working capital changes. 50 table of contents index to financial statements net cash used in investing activities totaled $8.102 billion in 2007, compared with $2.955 billion in 2006 and $3.127 billion in 2005. significant investing activities include capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and asset disposals. capital expenditures by segment for continuing operations for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table. (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 e&amp;p united states $ 1,354 $ 1,302 $ 638 international 1,157 867 728 total e&amp;p 2,511 2,169 1,366 osm 165 rm&amp;t 1,640 916 841 ig 93 307 571 corporate 57 41 18 total $ 4,466 $ 3,433 $ 2,796 the majority of the $1.033 billion increase in capital expenditures in 2007 over 2006 was in our rm&amp;t segment and primarily related to the expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery. spending on e&amp;p projects increased $342 million over 2006, primarily as a result of continued work on the alvheim/vilje development offshore norway and exploration activities in angola and the gulf of mexico. the decrease in integrated gas spending from 2006 reflects the completion of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea in may 2007. the $637 million increase in capital expenditures in 2006 over 2005 primarily resulted from increased spending in the e&amp;p segment and primarily related to significant acreage acquisitions in the williston basin of north dakota and eastern montana (the bakken shale formation) and the piceance basin of colorado, as well as to the alvheim/vilje development and to the neptune development in the gulf of mexico. the $264 million decrease in integrated gas spending from 2005 reflected the fact that the lng production facility in equatorial guinea was nearing completion in 2006. acquisitions in 2007 consist primarily of the $3.907 billion cash portion of the western acquisition purchase price, net of the $44 million of western cash acquired. in 2006, acquisitions primarily included cash payments of $718 million associated with our re-entry into libya and in 2005 included cash payments of $506 million for the acquisition of ashland 38 percent ownership interest in mpc. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. disposal of assets and of discontinued operations totaled $137 million, $966 million and $131 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005. proceeds of $832 million from the disposal of discontinued operations in 2006 related to the sale of our russian exploration and production businesses in june 2006. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. disposal of assets included proceeds from the sale of our interests in two lng tankers in alaska in 2007 and proceeds from the sale of 90 percent of our interest in syrian natural gas fields in 2006. disposals for all years included proceeds from the sale of various domestic producing properties and ssa stores. net cash provided from financing activities totaled $184 million in 2007, compared with cash used in financing activities of $2.581 billion in 2006 and $2.345 billion in 2005. sources of cash in 2007 included the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes and borrowings of $578 million from the norwegian export credit agency. significant uses of cash in financing activities during both 2007 and 2006 were common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plan discussed below, dividend payments and debt repayments including the early extinguishment of portions of our outstanding debt. the most significant use of cash in 2005 was related to the repayment of $1.920 billion of debt assumed as a part of the acquisition of ashland 38 percent interest in mpc. significant noncash transactions during 2007 included the issuance of $1.0 billion of 5.125 percent fixed rate revenue bonds (marathon oil corporation project) series 2007a, with a maturity date of june 1, 2037. the proceeds from the bonds are held in trust to be disbursed to us upon our request for reimbursement of expenditures related to our garyville, louisiana refinery expansion. through december 31, 2007, such reimbursements have totaled $280 million. the $1.0 billion obligation is reflected as long-term debt and the remaining $744 million of trusteed funds, including interest income earned to date, is reflected as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2007. 51 table of contents index to financial statements derivative instruments see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. dividends to stockholders dividends of $0.92 per common share or $637 million were paid during 2007. on january 27, 2008, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.24 cents per share on our common stock, payable march 10, 2008, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 20, 2008. liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed credit facilities and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. our ability to access the debt capital market is supported by our investment grade credit ratings. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor corporation, moody investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+, baa1, and bbb+. these ratings were reaffirmed in july 2007 after the western acquisition was announced. because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and potential asset sales, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including our capital spending programs, stock repurchase program, repayment of debt maturities and any amounts that ultimately may be paid in connection with contingencies. we have a committed $3.0 billion revolving credit facility with third-party financial institutions terminating in may 2012. at december 31, 2007, there were no borrowings against this facility and we had no commercial paper outstanding under our u.s. commercial paper program that is backed by this revolving credit facility. on july 26, 2007, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 22 percent at december 31, 2007, compared to six percent at year-end 2006 as shown below. this includes $498 million of debt that is serviced by united states steel.

issuance of the $1.0 billion of revenue bonds by the parish of st. john the baptist, the proceeds were trusteed and will be disbursed to us upon our request for reimbursement of expenditures related to the garyville refinery expansion. the trusteed funds are reflected as other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2007. 52 table of contents index to financial statements during 2007 and 2006, we extinguished portions of our outstanding debt with face values of $93 million and $162 million. the debt was repurchased at a weighted average price equal to 117 percent of face value in 2007 and 122 percent of face value in 2006. we will continue to evaluate debt repurchase opportunities as they arise. a consolidated subsidiary, marathon oil canada corporation (formerly western oil sands inc.), had a committed 805 million canadian dollar revolving term credit facility with third-party financial institutions at december 31, 2007. this facility was in place prior to our acquisition of western, and had outstanding borrowings of 592 million canadian dollars ($599 million) at december 31, 2007. marathon oil canada corporation did not meet certain financial covenants contained in the facility as of december 31, 2007. in february 2008, we repaid the outstanding balance and terminated the facility. as discussed in more detail below under outlook, we have approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $7.993 billion for 2008, which represents a 67 percent increase over our 2007 spending. consistent with our philosophy of maintaining financial discipline and flexibility, we have commenced a review of our portfolio of assets with the intent of monetizing those assets which are either mature or otherwise non-strategic, thus allowing us to re-deploy our capital into the projects included in our capital, investment and exploration budget. we are in the early stage of this review process, so we expect that the majority of proceeds from any such asset sales would be received in the second half of 2008. our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. the discussion of liquidity above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital, investment and exploration spending and a review of our portfolio of assets. the forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading or refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. factors that could affect the review of our portfolio of assets include the identification of buyers and the negotiation of acceptable prices and other terms, as well as other customary closing conditions. share repurchase program since january 2006, our board of directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. as of december 31, 2007, we had repurchased 58 million common shares at a cost of $2.520 billion. purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. this program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. the program authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables; however, we expect to complete the authorized purchases by the end of 2009, although repurchases are likely to be less ratable than in prior years. the timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales and cash from available borrowings. the forward-looking statements about our common share repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or refining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. 53 table of contents index to financial statements contractual

(h) primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. we have estimated projected funding requirements through 2016. (i) includes $544 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel. off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees, united states steel and others. these arrangements are described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. 54 table of contents index to financial statements we are a party to an agreement that would require us to purchase, under certain circumstances, the interest in pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ) not currently owned. this put/call agreement is described in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. nonrecourse indebtedness of investees certain of our investees have incurred indebtedness that we do not support through guarantees or otherwise. if we were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata ownership basis, our share would have been $522 million as of december 31, 2007. of this amount, $251 million relates to ptc. if any of these investees default, we have no obligation to support the debt. our partner in ptc has guaranteed $50 million of the total ptc debt. obligations associated with the separation of united states steel we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation. united states steel obligations to us are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. if united states steel fails to satisfy these obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. as of december 31, 2007, we have identified the following obligations that have been assumed by united states steel: $415 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $9 million at december 31, 2007. $45 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2007. $38 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel clairton coke-making facility, with a term extending to 2012. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2007. $26 million of operating lease obligations, all of which was assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee of all obligations of united states steel as general partner of clairton 1314b partnership, l.p. to the limited partners. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $533 million, obligations of $507 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2007 (current portion $22 million; long-term portion $485 million). the remaining $26 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. 55 table of contents index to financial statements the table below provides aggregated information on the portion of our consolidated obligations to make future cash payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by united states steel as of december 31, 2007. summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel (in millions) total 2008 2009- 2010 2011- 2012 later years long-term debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 415 $ $ $ $ 415 sale-leaseback financing (includes imputed interest) 55 11 22 22 capital lease obligations 48 10 19 19 operating lease obligations under sublease 26 5 10 11 total contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel $ 544 $ 26 $ 51 $ 52 $ 415 (a) we anticipate cash payments for interest of $23 million for 2008, $46 million for 2009-2010, $38 million for 2011-2012 and $223 million for the later years to be assumed by united states steel. united states steel reported in its form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2007, that it has restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. further, united states steel reported that the restrictive nature of its financial covenants decreased during 2007 and that its management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. transactions with related parties we own a 63 percent working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea. onshore equatorial guinea, we own a 52 percent interest in an lpg processing plant, a 60 percent interest in an lng production facility and a 45 percent interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. we sell our marketed natural gas from the alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. the methanol that is produced is then sold through another equity method investee. sales to our 50 percent equity method investee, ptc, which consist primarily of refined petroleum products, accounted for 2.5 percent or less of our total sales revenue for 2007, 2006 and 2005. ptc is the largest travel center network in the united states and operates 286 travel centers in the united states and canada. prior to our acquisition of ashland 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30, 2005, ashland was a related party as a result of that interest. during that time, we sold refined petroleum products consisting mainly of petrochemicals, base lube oils and asphalt to ashland. our sales to ashland accounted for less than one percent of our total sales revenue for 2005. we believe that these transactions were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. our environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were: (a) (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 capital $ 199 $ 176 $ 390 compliance operating and maintenance 287 309 250 remediation (b) 25 20 25 total $ 511 $ 505 $ 665 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines regarding the definition of environmental expenditures. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. 56 table of contents index to financial statements our environmental capital expenditures accounted for four percent of capital expenditures for continuing operations in 2007, five percent in 2006 and 14 percent in 2005. we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $313 million or 4 percent of capital expenditures in 2008. predictions beyond 2008 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $735 million in 2009; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, see business environmental matters and for information on legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see legal proceedings. outlook capital, investment and exploration budget our board of directors approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $7.993 billion for 2008, which includes budgeted capital expenditures of $7.651 billion. this represents a 67 percent increase over 2007 spending. the focus of the 2008 budget is to grow our refining capacity through the garyville refinery expansion, further develop our long-life canadian oil sands assets, capitalize on the ownership of those oil sands assets by upgrading and expanding our detroit refinery, fund our ongoing exploration activities and develop existing fields, including new developments in angola and the gulf of mexico. the budget includes worldwide production spending of $2.144 billion, primarily in the united states for expansion of the bakken shale and piceance basin resource plays and development of the droshky prospect in the gulf of mexico, but also in norway and angola. the worldwide exploration budget of $1.045 billion includes plans to drill six to ten exploration or appraisal wells. it also includes $150 million related to our high bids on leases from the october 2007 gulf of mexico lease sale which were awarded in early 2008. other exploration plans include activity within or adjacent to our onshore producing properties in the united states, appraisal drilling and pre-feed costs in angola, and evaluation drilling and feasibility studies of the in-situ recovery projects in canada. the budget includes $910 million for the oil sands mining segment, primarily for the phase 1 expansion of the aosp which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine, expansion of the scotford upgrader and development of associated infrastructure. the budget includes $3.528 billion for rm&amp;t, primarily for the garyville refinery expansion and the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. the rm&amp;t budget also includes increased investments in transportation, logistics and marketing assets. the integrated gas segment budget of $20 million is substantially lower than 2007 because construction on the lng production facility in equatorial guinea was completed and the facility began operations in 2007. the remaining $346 million is designated for capitalized interest and corporate activities. this capital, investment and exploration budget represents a significant increase over our 2007 spending. consistent with our philosophy of maintaining financial discipline and flexibility, we have commenced a review of our portfolio of assets with the intent of monetizing those assets which are either mature or otherwise non-strategic, thus allowing us to re-deploy our capital into the projects included in our capital, investment and exploration budget. we are in the early stage of this review process, so we expect that the majority of proceeds from any such asset sales would be received in the second half of 2008. 57 table of contents index to financial statements the forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. the discussion above also contains forward-looking statements regarding a review of our portfolio of assets. factors that could affect the review of our portfolio of assets include the identification of buyers and the negotiation of acceptable prices and other terms, as well as other customary closing conditions. exploration and production we announced nine discoveries in 2007 (eight in deepwater angola and one in the gulf of mexico). major exploration activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include those: offshore angola, on block 31 in which we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest and have announced 15 discoveries, and on block 32, in which we hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest and have announced 11 discoveries. we plan to participate in four to five exploration or appraisal wells in these deepwater blocks in 2008. current plans call for a potential development area in the northeastern part of block 31, which encompasses the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries. additional potential development areas lie in the southeast and middle portions of the block. seven of the block 32 discoveries form our first potential development in the eastern area of that block. in equatorial guinea, where we are evaluating development scenarios for the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, one of which includes production through the alba field infrastructure. we own a 63 percent interest in the alba block and serve as operator; in norway, where we now own interests in 16 licenses covering over 800,000 gross acres offshore and plan to drill one or two exploration wells during 2008; in the united kingdom, where we plan to participate in the u.k. onshore licensing round during 2008 to secure additional coal bed methane acreage; and in the gulf of mexico, where we plan to participate in two to three exploration wells during 2008. during 2007, we continued to make progress in advancing key development projects that will help serve as the basis for our production growth profile in the coming years. major development and production activities currently underway or under evaluation include those: in the gulf of mexico, with the neptune development and the droshky discovery. the neptune development, in which we own a 30 percent outside-operated working interest, is on target for first production by early 2008. development of the droshky discovery, in which we own a 100 percent working interest, is expected to be sanctioned during 2008, with first production as early as 2010 dependent upon delivery of key equipment and regulatory approvals. rig capacity has been secured for droshky development drilling. in norway, where our alvheim/vilje development will consist of an fpso vessel with subsea infrastructure. the fpso sailed from the shipyard in mid-february 2008 to undergo testing, after which it will proceed offshore for connection to the subsea infrastructure. first production is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008, weather permitting, at which time six wells will be available. drilling activities will continue in 2008. a peak net production rate of 75 mboepd is expected in 2008. we are the operator of the alvheim development, which includes the kameleon and kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. we own a 47 percent outside-operated interest in the nearby vilje discovery. also, the volund discovery, a tie-back to the alvheim fpso continues to make progress towards first production in 2009. we own a 65 percent interest in volund and serve as operator; 58 table of contents index to financial statements in libya, where we continue to work with our partners to maximize the potential of this major asset. we own a 16.33 percent outside-operated interest in the approximately 13 million acre waha concessions; in ireland, where the corrib natural gas development project continues and the operator expects first production in 2009. we own a 19 percent outside-operated interest in corrib; in the piceance basin of colorado, where we have two drilling rigs running, and plan to increase the rig count to four by the end of 2008, drilling 165 wells in the region over the next two years; and in the williston basin of north dakota and eastern montana (the bakken shale formation), where we have six rigs running and plan to drill approximately 350 locations over the next four to five years. with the alvheim/vilje and neptune developments coming online, we estimate that our 2008 liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales will average approximately 380 to 420 mboepd, excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. projected liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola and the droshky discovery in the gulf of mexico, the timing of production from the neptune development, the droshky discovery, the alvheim/vilje development, the volund field and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. except for the neptune, alvheim/vilje and volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments of the droshky discovery and blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. oil sands mining the aosp phase 1 expansion is under construction and we expect that it will be complete in late 2010. the expansion includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine and expansion of the scotford upgrader, along with construction of common infrastructure sized to support future mining expansions. the scotford upgrader returned to full operation in december 2007 after a mid-november fire and the completion of maintenance that had originally been scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 and was completed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. we anticipate our net bitumen production will be approximately 30 mbpd in 2008. projected bitumen production is based upon a number of assumptions, including pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, regulatory constraints, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the anticipated completion of the aosp expansion. factors which could affect the expansion include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. 59 table of contents index to financial statements refining, marketing and transportation throughout 2007, we remained focused on our strategy of leveraging refining and marketing investments in core markets, as well as expanding and enhancing our asset base while controlling costs. our 2007 average daily crude oil throughput and total refinery throughput were at record levels. construction continues on an expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery with a total projected cost of $3.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). this expansion will increase the refinery crude oil throughput capacity by 180 mbpd and, when completed in late 2009, will enable the refinery to provide an additional 7.5 million gallons of clean transportation fuels to the market each day. in 2007, a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit, michigan refinery was approved at a total projected cost of $1.9 billion (excluding capitalized interest). construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2008, subject to obtaining the necessary permits from applicable regulatory agencies. we also continue our investment in transportation and storage assets to increase our ability to blend and distribute ethanol. by mid-2008, we expect to have the capacity to blend to an e-10 level (90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol) across our entire gasoline distribution network. we previously estimated that we would spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with mobile source air toxics ii regulations relating to benzene. we have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these recently promulgated requirements, but the cost estimates will increase and may be approximately $1 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2008. the cost estimates have increased due to better definition of the projects needed to meet the requirements of the finalized regulations and updated construction cost estimates. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the planned expansion of the garyville refinery, the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, our ethanol program and mobile source air toxics ii regulations compliance costs. some factors that could affect the garyville and detroit projects include necessary government and third-party approvals, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, other risks customarily associated with construction projects and crude oil supply. factors that could affect our ethanol program include necessary government and third-party approvals, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the compliance cost estimates are subject to change as feed work is completed in 2008. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas net worldwide lng sales volumes are expected to average 6,225 to 6,875 metric tonnes per day in 2008. projected lng sales volumes are based upon a number of assumptions, including unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and government or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations. in 2007 we completed those portions of the feed required to support the near-term efforts related to a potential second lng production facility on bioko island, equatorial guinea. the scope of the feed work for the potential 4.4 mmtpa lng project included feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil-off gas compression, product transfer to storage and lng product metering. we expect to make progress towards an investment decision in 2008. the above discussion contains forward looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility which could potentially be affected by partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient re-gasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 60 table of contents index to financial statements accounting standards not yet adopted in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 141 (revised 2007), business combinations. this statement significantly changes the accounting for business combinations. under sfas no. 141(r), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition-date fair values with limited exceptions. the statement expands the definition of a business and is expected to be applicable to more transactions than the previous business combinations standard. the statement also changes the accounting treatment for changes in control, step acquisitions, transaction costs, acquired contingent liabilities, in-process research and development, restructuring costs, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of a business combination and changes in income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date. additional disclosures are also required. for us, sfas no. 141(r) will be applied prospectively effective january 1, 2009. also in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no. 51. this statement establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. specifically, this statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (sometimes called a minority interest) is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent equity. it requires that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income statement. sfas no. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. in addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, based on the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. additional disclosures are required that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. for us, sfas no. 160 will be effective january 1, 2009 and early adoption is prohibited. the statement must be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented in consolidated financial statements. we are currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. it requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be recorded in net income. the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. for us, sfas no. 159 is effective january 1, 2008, and retrospective application is not permitted. we did not elect the fair value option when this standard became effective. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements. this statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but may require some entities to change their measurement practices. in february 2008, the fasb issued fasb staff position ( fsp ) fas 157-1, application of fasb statement no. 157 to fasb statement no. 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13, which removes certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas no. 157, and fsp fas 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no. 157, which defers the effective date of sfas no. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. for us, except for the nonfinancial assets and liabilities subject to the one-year deferral, sfas no. 157 is effective january 1, 2008. we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 61 table of contents index to financial statements item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. we employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. we believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. commodity price risk our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses. we also may utilize the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions. our e&amp;p segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the natural gas price risk during the time that the natural gas is held in storage before it is sold or on natural gas that is purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production. we also may use commodity derivative instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on portions of our future sales of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas when it is deemed advantageous to do so. certain long-term natural gas contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments are excluded from e&amp;p segment income. for additional information on these u.k. natural gas contracts, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates fair value estimates. our osm segment uses commodity derivative instruments to protect against price decreases on portions of our future sales of synthetic crude oil when it is deemed advantageous to do so. our rm&amp;t segment uses commodity derivative instruments on a selective basis, primarily to mitigate crude oil price risk between the time that crude oil purchases are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products or during the time that crude oil inventories are held before they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. to a lesser extent, we also use derivative instruments in our rm&amp;t segment to manage price risk related to refined petroleum products, feedstocks used in the refining process and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products. our strategies allow us to realize acceptable margins for our various refined products but at times may limit our ability to take advantage of certain market opportunities. additionally, certain contracts in our rm&amp;t segment involving the purchase or sale of commodities are not considered normal purchases or normal sales under generally accepted accounting principles and are required to be accounted for as derivative instruments. generally, commodity derivative instruments used in our e&amp;p segment qualify for hedge accounting. as a result, we do not recognize in net income any changes in the fair value of those derivative instruments until the underlying physical transaction occurs. we have not attempted to qualify commodity derivative instruments used in our osm or rm&amp;t segments for hedge accounting. as a result, we recognize in net income all changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in those operations. open derivative positions as of december 31, 2007 and sensitivity analysis at year end our e&amp;p segment held open derivative contracts to mitigate the price risk on natural gas held in storage or purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production in amounts that were in line with 62 table of contents index to financial statements normal levels of activity. at december 31, 2007, we had no open derivative contracts related to our future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and therefore remained substantially exposed to market prices of these commodities. at october 18, 2007, western held crude oil put options purchased in october 2005 for the three-year period beginning january 1, 2007. the premiums for the purchased put options had been partially offset through the sale of call options for the same three-year period, resulting in a net premium liability. payment of the net premium liability is deferred until the settlement of the option contracts. as of december 31, 2007, the following put and call options were outstanding: option expiration dates 2008 2009 option contract volumes (barrels per day) : put options purchased 20,000 20,000 call options sold 15,000 15,000 average exercise price (dollars per barrel) : put options $ 54.25 $ 50.50 call options $ 94.25 $ 90.50 at year end our rm&amp;t segment held open derivative contracts in amounts that were in line with normal levels of activity. sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations ( ifo ) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31, 2007, is provided in the following table. the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would result in the largest incremental decrease in ifo when applied to the commodity derivative instruments used to hedge that commodity. incremental decrease in ifo assuming a hypothetical price change of (a) (in millions) 10% 25% commodity derivative instruments: (b) crude oil $ 1 (c) $ natural gas 99 (c) 220 (c) refined products 22 (c) 59 (c) (a) we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity. effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis. amounts reflect hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in closing commodity prices for each open contract position at december 31, 2007. included in the natural gas impacts above are $102 million and $229 million for hypothetical price changes of 10 percent and 25 percent related to the long-term u.k. natural gas contracts accounted for as derivative instruments. we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. the creditworthiness of counterparties is reviewed continuously and master netting agreements are used when practical. changes to the portfolio after december 31, 2007, would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above. (b) the number of net open contracts for the e&amp;p segment varied throughout 2007, from a low of 15 contracts on april 30, 2007, to a high of 1,475 contracts on march 15, 2007, and averaged 719 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the rm&amp;t segment varied throughout 2007, from a low of 22 contracts on february 7, 2007, to a high of 31,872 contracts on september 24, 2007, and averaged 12,261 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the osm segment varied throughout 2007, from a low of 25,585 contracts on december 31, 2007 to a high of 28,345 contracts on october 18, 2007, the western acquisition date, and averaged 26,965 for the post-acquisition period. the commodity derivative instruments used and positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects. (c) price increase. 63 table of contents index to financial statements derivative gains or losses included in results of operations pretax derivative losses of $15 million in 2007 and gains of $25 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005 were included in e&amp;p segment income and were primarily related to derivatives utilized to protect the value of natural gas in storage and margins on natural gas purchased for use in our marketing activities. pretax derivative losses of $54 million were included in osm segment income for 2007. these losses primarily resulted from the increase in crude oil prices since the acquisition date of western. pretax derivative gains and losses included in rm&amp;t segment income for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table: (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 strategy: mitigate price risk on purchases of crude oil and other commodities $ (378 ) $ 204 $ (57 ) mitigate price risk on carrying values of inventories (511 ) 200 (118 ) other (10 ) (4 ) (63 ) subtotal, non-trading activities (899 ) 400 (238 ) trading activities (1 ) 1 (87 ) total net derivative gains (losses) $ (900 ) $ 401 $ (325 ) interest rate risk we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations which affect the fair value of certain financial instruments. we manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing the mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt in our portfolio. we have entered into several interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. the following table summarizes our interest rate swaps as of december 31, 2007. (in millions) fixed rate to be received notional amount swap maturity fair value floating rate to be paid: six-month libor +3.285% 6.850 % $ 400 2008 $ (2 ) six-month libor +2.142% 6.125 % $ 200 2012 $ (1 ) sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates is provided in the following table. december 31, 2007 (in millions) fair value (b) incremental change in fair value financial assets (liabilities): (a) receivables from united states steel $ 500 (c) $ 10 (d) interest rate swap agreements $ (3 ) (c) $ 5 (d) long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ (7,176 ) (c) $ (330 ) (d) (a) fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. (b) see notes 18 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the carrying value of these instruments. (c) fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. (d) for receivables from united states steel and long-term debt, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity of our long-term debt at december 31, 2007. for interest rate swap agreements, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the effective swap rate at december 31, 2007. 64 table of contents index to financial statements at december 31, 2007, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. foreign currency exchange rate risk we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward and option contracts. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates by locking in such rates. the following table summarizes our derivative foreign currency instruments as of december 31, 2007. (dollars in millions) period notional amount average forward rate (a) fair value (b) foreign currency forwards: euro january 2008 november 2008 $ 31 1.281 (c) $ 4 kroner (norway) january 2008 october 2009 $ 71 6.090 (d) $ 8 dollar (canada) february 2008 $ 54 1.007 (d) (a) rates shown are weighted average forward rates for the period. (b) fair value was based on market rates. (c) u.s. dollar to foreign currency. (d) foreign currency to u.s. dollar. the aggregate cash flow effect on foreign currency forward contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change to exchange rates at december 31, 2007, would be approximately $11 million. during 2007, we entered into derivative foreign currency instruments with a notional amount of $3.5 billion to limit our exposure to changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate related to the cash portion of the purchase for western. these derivative instruments were settled on october 17, 2007, and a pretax gain of $182 million was recognized. safe harbor these quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and other feedstocks. if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 65 table of contents index to financial statementsrisk factors 25 risk factors, item 3. legal proceedings, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict, target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, bitumen and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the usx separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the usx separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001, and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions, map is wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. on october 18, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of western oil sands inc. ( western ). western primary asset was a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of alberta, canada. the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include western results from october 18, 2007. western oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment. 2 table of contents index to financial statements segment and geographic information our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and by-products; 3) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states; and 4) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. we conduct exploration, development and production activities in ten countries: the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, gabon, indonesia, ireland, libya, norway and the united kingdom. our 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 211 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2008 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 1,016 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2008 worldwide net sales averaged 381 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe. exploration in the united states during 2008, we drilled 71 gross (48 net) exploratory wells of which 60 gross (42 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 60 wells, 3 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 12 gross (3 net) exploratory wells of which 11 gross (3 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 11 wells, 5 gross (1 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2008. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area. at the end of 2008, we had interests in 103 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 97 in the deepwater area. we have been awarded 42 blocks on which we were the high bidder in the federal outer continental shelf lease sales no. 205 and 206 conducted by the u.s. minerals management service ( mms ) in late 2007 and early 2008. our initial net investment in these blocks was $343 million. we own 100 percent of fifteen of the blocks. we acquired the remaining blocks in conjunction with partners. our plans call for initial drilling on some of these leases in 2009 and 2010. in 2008, a successful appraisal well was drilled on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508 after a 2005 discovery. we hold a 25 percent outside-operated interest in the stones prospect. in the third quarter of 2008, we announced a gulf of mexico deepwater discovery on the gunflint prospect located on mississippi canyon block 948. we own a 13 percent outside-operated interest in the prospect. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the prospect. in 2008, we successfully completed our first horizontal well in the woodford shale resource play in the anadarko basin of oklahoma. we are currently participating in additional horizontal wells in the area where we hold 30,000 net acres. we hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the u.s. in the appalachian basin we hold 65,000 net acres in the marcellus shale resource play in pennsylvania and west virginia. we hold 25,000 net acres, primarily in texas, in the haynesville shale resource play located in north louisiana and east texas. initial drilling on some of these leases is planned for 2009. angola offshore angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in block 32. through december 2008, 28 discoveries on these blocks have been announced, including the portia and dione discoveries on angola block 31 in 2008. 3 table of contents index to financial statements norway we hold interests in over 510,000 gross acres offshore norway, including production license 505 ( pl 505 ) that was awarded in january 2009. in 2009, exploration drilling is expected to commence on additional prospects with the potential to be tied back to the alvheim complex. indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3d seismic acquisition in may 2008. we expect to begin exploratory drilling in early 2010. additionally, in october 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the bone bay block offshore indonesia. the bone bay block is 200 miles southeast of our pasangkayu block. current exploration plans for bone bay call for the acquisition of seismic data starting in 2010, followed by drilling in 2011. we are the operator of a drilling rig consortium that has secured a two-year contract for a deepwater exploration drilling rig. the rig will be used for deepwater exploration activities by us and by five other companies in indonesia. the participants have the right to extend this rig commitment. we continue to participate in joint study agreements in indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. we completed two joint study agreements in 2008. equatorial guinea during 2004, we announced the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, in which we hold a 63 percent operated interest, and the corona well on block d, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline. libya we hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2008 included the drilling of three wells, all of which were successful. most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration-stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. initial test drilling on the 100 percent interest birchwood prospect positively confirmed bitumen presence with additional test drilling required to confirm reservoir quality. united kingdom we have a 45 percent interest in five exploratory u.k. onshore coal seam gas ( csg ) licenses. drilling has been completed in five exploration wells in three of the licenses. one test well was completed in 2007 and three lateral wells for production testing were drilled in 2008. we and our partners were awarded 11 new blocks for csg exploration and potential future development during the 13th onshore licensing round in 2008. after the 2008 licensing our interest covers 520,000 acres. we are the operator of these new licenses and have a 55 percent working interest. production (including development activities) united states our u.s. operations accounted for 30 percent of our 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 44 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. during 2008, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 23 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 36 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 20 mmcfd of natural gas, representing five percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. at year end 2008, we held interests in six producing fields and five platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which we operate one platform. hurricanes gustav and ike impacted gulf of mexico operations in the latter part of the third quarter of 2008, resulting in approximately 9.5 net mboepd being shut-in during the quarter. the ewing bank development resumed production in october 2008, but the outside-operated ursa and troika fields were shut-in for repairs until november 2008 and january 2009, respectively, impacting fourth quarter sales by approximately 7 mboepd. we have a 65 percent working interest in ewing bank, a four percent overriding royalty interest in ursa and a 50 percent working interest in troika. we own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in the petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. the petronius platform also provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. for example, petronius processes liquid hydrocarbons from our perseus field which commenced production in april 2005 and is located five miles from the platform. 4 table of contents index to financial statements the neptune development in the gulf of mexico commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in july 2008. we hold a 30 percent outside-operated working interest in this development located on atwater valley area in the gulf of mexico, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the development plan included seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform and six wells have been drilled and completed. in october 2008, development of the droshky discovery, located in the gulf of mexico on green canyon block 244, was authorized by our board of directors. the initial droshky discovery well and two sidetracks were drilled in 2007, followed in 2008 by a second delineation and sidetrack well. the project will consist of development wells, which will be tied back to the nearby third-party owned and operated bullwinkle platform. we have secured a rig to begin drilling in 2009, and first production is targeted for 2010. net sales after royalties are expected to peak at about 45 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 43 mmcfd of natural gas. we hold a 100 percent working interest in droshky. also in october 2008, development of the ozona prospect, located in the gulf of mexico on garden banks block 515 was authorized by our board of directors. we have secured a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby outside-operated auger platform. first production is expected in 2011. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2008, our net natural gas sales from alaska averaged 126 mmcfd, representing 28 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales volumes. our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 19 mbpd and 123 mmcfd in 2008. our wyoming net natural gas sales decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of natural field declines, partially offset by new wells in the wamsutter field and powder river basin areas. development of the powder river basin continued in 2008 with 100 operated wells drilled, which was down from the 170 wells drilled in 2007. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2008 where we participated in the drilling of six wells. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas and north louisiana, with combined net sales of 137 mmcfd in 2008, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the permian basin of southeast new mexico and west texas, with net sales of 11 mbpd in 2008. we hold 320,000 acres in the williston basin (the bakken shale resource play). the majority of the acreage is located in north dakota with the remainder in eastern montana. this represents a substantial position in the bakken shale where approximately 225 locations will be drilled over the next four to five years. we currently have four operated drilling rigs running and ended 2008 with december average net sales of 8.2 mboepd. we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. our plans include drilling approximately 150 wells over the next five years. drilling and production commenced in late 2007. we currently have one operated drilling rig running and ended 2008 with december average net sales of 10 mmcfd. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. the east brae platform hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 26 percent working interest. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the brae area averaged 12 mbpd in 2008. net brae natural gas sales averaged 119 mmcfd, or 21 percent, of our international natural gas sales volumes in 2008. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area and the third-party beryl area and has a 5 table of contents index to financial statements total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and has the capacity for almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the britannia, atlantic and cromarty fields. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own a 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. net sales from the foinaven fields averaged 12 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 6 mmcfd of natural gas in 2008. norway norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed above. we were approved for our first operatorship on the norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate seven licenses, including the pl 505, which was awarded in january 2009. the operated alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf commenced production in june 2008. the complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ( fpso ) with subsea infrastructure. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas transported to the sage system using a new 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. first production to the complex was from the alvheim development which is comprised of the kameleon and kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. at the end of 2008, the alvheim development included ten producing wells and two water disposal wells. the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. the two vilje development wells were drilled and completed in 2007. additionally, in 2007, the norwegian government approved a plan for development and operation to develop the volund field as a subsea tie-back to the alvheim complex. the volund development will consist of three production wells and one water disposal well, all to be drilled in the 2009 and 2010. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent working interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in late 2009. in addition, we hold a 28 percent outside-operated interest in the gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of norway, where a successful appraisal well was drilled in 2006. in january 2009, the operator announced a development concept that includes a fixed processing platform with seven production wells that would be tied to existing facilities on the sleipner field. a final investment decision is expected in 2009. on october 31, 2008, we closed the sale of our non-core, outside-operated interests (24 percent of heimdal field, 47 percent of vale field and 20 percent of skirne field) and associated undeveloped acreage in offshore norway. ireland in december 2008, we announced an agreement to sell our wholly-owned subsidiary which owns our producing properties in ireland. closing is subject to customary closing conditions. properties included in the sale are our 100 percent working interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale natural gas fields and our 87 percent operated working interest in the seven heads natural gas field in the celtic sea offshore ireland. also included is a 100 percent interest in our gas storage business which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the southwest kinsale field. we own a 19 percent working interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off ireland northwest coast, where six of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. four of these wells were completed and tested at the end of 2008. terminal construction and offshore pipe installation are currently underway and onshore pipeline installation is planned to commence in 2009. the operator expects first production from the field in late 2010 or early 2011. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea during 2008, net liquid hydrocarbon sales average 41 mbpd or 28 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 366 mmcfd, or 64 percent of our international natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2008 included 26 mbpd of condensate. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant. alba field natural gas is supplied to the lpg plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price. during 2008, a gross 883 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and our net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2008 included 11 mbpd of lpg and 4 mbpd of secondary condensate produced by alba plant llc. 6 table of contents index to financial statements as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ). ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. alba field dry natural gas, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. during 2008, a gross 94 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 565 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production. angola the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the psvm development. key contracts were awarded and construction work commenced in the second half of 2008. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned for the psvm development. other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. seven of the block 32 discoveries form a potential development in the eastern area of that block. libya we resumed operations in libya in 2006, holding a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions. net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 46 mbpd in 2008 compared to 45 mbpd in 2007. the 2008 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya represented 31 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. net natural gas sales in libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2008. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent working interest. net sales in gabon averaged 6 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2008. production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at tchatamba marin, with the processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. other matters during the first quarter of 2008, we relinquished our interest in an exploration and production license in sudan, and as a result, we no longer have any interests in sudan. we ceased efforts to pursue exploration opportunities in ukraine and closed our kiev office in the third quarter of 2008. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the equatorial guinea discoveries, the timing of production from the woodford shale resource play, the droshky and ozona developments in the gulf of mexico, the volund development, the sale of a subsidiary which owns producing properties in ireland and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. except for the volund development, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments on blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, and the equatorial guinea discoveries could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. factors that could affect the sale of the subsidiary include customary closing conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 7 table of contents index to financial statements reserves at december 31, 2008, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1,195 million boe, of

the joint venture agreement are satisfied. the following table sets forth changes in estimated quantities of net proved bitumen reserves for the year 2008. estimated quantities of proved bitumen reserves (millions of barrels) 2008 beginning of year 421 revisions (a) (30 ) extensions, discoveries and additions 6 production (9 ) end of year 388 (a) revisions were driven primarily by price and the impact of the new royalty regime discussed below. the above estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is a forward-looking statement and is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved bitumen reserves estimation process, see item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved bitumen reserves. operations at the aosp are not within the scope of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no. 25, suspension of certain accounting requirements for oil and gas producing companies (an amendment of financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) statement no. 19), sfas no. 69, disclosures about oil and gas producing activities (an amendment of fasb statements 19, 25, 33 and 39), and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) rule 4-10 of regulation s-x; therefore, bitumen production and reserves are not included in our supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. the sec has recently issued a release amending these disclosure requirements effective for annual reports on form 10-k for fiscal years ending on or after december 31, 2009, see item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting standards not yet adopted for additional information. prior to our acquisition of western, the first fully-integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved in 2006. expansion 1, which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine, expansion of the scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure, is anticipated to begin operations in late 2010 or 2011. when expansion 1 is complete, we will have more than 50,000 bpd of net production and upgrading capacity in the canadian oil sands. the timing and scope of future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review. during 2008, the alberta government accepted the project application to have a portion of the expansion 1 capital costs form part of the muskeg river mine allowable cost recovery pool. due to commodity price declines in the year, royalties for 2008 were one percent of the gross mine revenue. commencing january 1, 2009, the alberta royalty regime has been amended such that royalty rates will be based on the canadian dollar ( cad ) equivalent monthly average west texas intermediate ( wti ) price. royalty rates will rise from a minimum of one percent to a maximum of nine percent under the gross revenue method and from a minimum of 25 percent to a maximum of 40 percent under the net revenue method. under both methods, the minimum royalty is based on a wti price of $55.00 cad per barrel and below while the maximum royalty is reached at a wti price of $120.00 cad per barrel and above, with a linear increase in royalty between the aforementioned prices. the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of aosp expansion 1. factors which could affect the expansion project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. refining, marketing and transportation refining we own and operate seven refineries in the gulf coast, midwest and upper great plains regions of the united states with an aggregate refining capacity of 1.016 million barrels per day ( mmbpd ) of crude oil. during 2008, 12 table of contents index to financial statements our refineries processed 944 mbpd of crude oil and 207 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil

cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, cumene, propane, propylene, sulfur and maleic anhydride. our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently. our garyville, louisiana, refinery is located along the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana. the garyville refinery processes heavy sour crude oil into products such as gasoline, distillates, sulfur, asphalt, propane, polymer grade propylene, isobutane and coke. in 2006, we approved an expansion of our garyville refinery by 180 mbpd to 436 mbpd, with a currently projected cost of $3.35 billion (excluding capitalized interest). construction commenced in early 2007 and is continuing on schedule. we estimate that, as of december 31, 2008, this project is approximately 75 percent complete. we expect to complete the expansion in late 2009. our catlettsburg, kentucky, refinery is located in northeastern kentucky on the western bank of the big sandy river, near the confluence with the ohio river. the catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, asphalt, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, propane, propylene and sulfur. our robinson, illinois, refinery is located in the southeastern illinois town of robinson. the robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline, jet

our accounting for matching buy/sell arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. this change resulted in lower refined products sales volumes for 2008, 2007 and the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under our previous accounting practices. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. gasoline and distillates we sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and no. 1 and no. 2 fuel oils (including kerosene, jet fuel, diesel fuel and home heating oil) to wholesale marketing customers in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. we sold 47 percent of our gasoline volumes and 88 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2008. the demand for gasoline is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically being at its highest levels during the summer months. we have blended fuel ethanol into gasoline for over 15 years and began increasing our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. we blended 57 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2008, 41 mbpd in 2007 and 35 mbpd in 2006. the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. we sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our marketing territory, including: chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; milwaukee, wisconsin and hartford, illinois. we also sell biodiesel-blended diesel in minnesota, illinois and kentucky. in 2007, we acquired a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in clymers, indiana. we also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in greenville, ohio. the greenville plant began production in february 2008. both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner. propane we produce propane at all seven of our refineries. propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers. feedstocks and special products we are a producer and marketer of petrochemicals and specialty products. product availability varies by refinery and includes benzene, cumene, dilute naphthalene oil, molten maleic anhydride, molten sulfur, propylene, toluene and xylene. we market propylene, cumene and sulfur domestically to customers in the chemical industry. we sell maleic anhydride throughout the united states and canada. we also have the capacity to produce 1,400 tons per day of anode grade coke at our robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry, and 2,700 tons per day of fuel grade coke at the garyville refinery, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications. in september 2008, we shut down our lubes facility in catlettsburg, kentucky, and sold from inventory through december 31, 2008; therefore, base oils, aromatic extracts and slack wax are no longer being produced and marketed. in addition, we have recently discontinued production and sales of petroleum pitch and aliphatic solvents. heavy fuel oil we produce and market heavy oil, also known as fuel oil, residual fuel or slurry at all seven of our refineries. another product of crude oil, heavy oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product. we also sell heavy fuel oil at our terminals in wellsville, ohio, and chattanooga, tennessee. asphalt we have refinery based asphalt production capacity of up to 102 mbpd. we market asphalt through 33 owned or leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. we have a broad customer base, including 15 table of contents index to financial statements approximately 710 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. we also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. retail marketing ssa, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the speedway &reg; and superamerica &reg; brands. diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. ssa retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. as of december 31, 2008, ssa had 1,617 retail outlets in nine states. sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2008. revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $2,838 million in 2008, $2,796 million in 2007 and $2,706 million in 2006. the demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of ssa markets, usually with the highest demand during the summer driving season. profit levels from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. in october 2008, we sold our interest in pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ), an operator of travel centers in the united states. pipeline transportation we own a system of pipelines through marathon pipe line llc ( mpl ) and ohio river pipe line llc ( orpl ), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the midwest and gulf coast regions to our refineries, our terminals and other pipeline systems. our mpl and orpl wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1,815 miles of crude oil lines and 1,826 miles of refined product lines comprising 34 systems located in 11 states. the mpl common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states, based on total barrels delivered. our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and federal energy regulatory commission regulations and guidelines, including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products. third parties generated 11 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines in 2008. our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years. pipeline barrels handled (thousands of barrels per day) 2008 2007 2006 crude oil trunk lines 1,405 1,451 1,437 refined products trunk lines 960 1,049 1,101 total 2,365 2,500 2,538 we also own 176 miles of private crude oil pipelines and 850 miles of private refined products pipelines, and we lease 217 miles of common carrier refined product pipelines. we have partial ownership interests in several pipeline companies that have approximately 780 miles of crude oil pipelines and 3,000 miles of refined products pipelines, including about 800 miles operated by mpl. in addition, mpl operates most of our private pipelines and 985 miles of crude oil and 160 miles of natural gas pipelines owned by our e&amp;p segment. our major refined product lines include the cardinal products pipeline and the wabash pipeline. the cardinal products pipeline delivers refined products from kenova, west virginia, to columbus, ohio. the wabash pipeline system delivers product from robinson, illinois, to various terminals in the area of chicago, illinois. other significant refined product pipelines owned and operated by mpl extend from: robinson, illinois, to louisville, kentucky; garyville, louisiana, to zachary, louisiana; and texas city, texas, to pasadena, texas. 16 table of contents index to financial statements in addition, as of december 31, 2008, we had interests in the following refined product pipelines: 65 percent undivided ownership interest in the louisville-lexington system, a petroleum products pipeline system extending from louisville to lexington, kentucky; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana, to north muskegon, michigan; 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting the gulf coast region with the midwest market; 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf coast to the midwest; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois, to toledo, ohio. our major crude oil lines run from: patoka, illinois, to catlettsburg, kentucky; patoka, illinois, to robinson, illinois; patoka, illinois, to lima, ohio; samaria, michigan, to detroit, michigan; and st. james, louisiana, to garyville, louisiana. in addition, as of december 31, 2008, we had interests in the following crude oil pipelines: 51 percent interest in loop llc, the owner and operator of loop, which is the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at clovelly, louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 37 percent interest in the capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana, to patoka, illinois; 26 percent undivided ownership interest in the maumee pipeline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from lima, ohio, to samaria, michigan; and 17 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, llc, which owns crude oil pipelines extending from clearbrook, minnesota, to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our st. paul park, minnesota refinery. we plan to construct, by the year 2012, a new section of pipeline connecting with the existing crude line from samaria, michigan, to detroit, michigan. this new section will deliver additional supplies of canadian crude to our detroit refinery. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the construction of a new section of pipeline in michigan. some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by government or third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. lng operations we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. in may 2007, egholdings completed construction of a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum ( mmtpa ) lng production facility on bioko island and delivered its first cargo of lng. lng from the production facility is sold 17 table of contents index to financial statements under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. sales of lng from this production facility totaled 3.4 metric tonnes in 2008. in 2008 we continued discussions with the government of equatorial guinea and partners regarding a potential second lng production facility on bioko island. we also own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant, and lease two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, we have sold our share of the lng plant production under long-term contract with two of japan largest utility companies, with 2008 lng deliveries totaling 40 gross bcf. in june 2008 we, along with our partner, received approval from the doe to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through march 2011. in april 2004, we began delivering lng cargoes at the elba island, georgia, lng regasification terminal pursuant to an lng sales and purchase agreement. under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as lng) per year, through march 31, 2021, with a possible extension to november 30, 2023. in september 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as lng, for a minimum period of five years. the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index. this supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at elba island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. the agreement commenced in 2005. methanol operations we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ampco owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field. sales of methanol from the plant totaled 792,794 metric tonnes in 2008. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the united states. natural gas technology we are developing a range of natural gas conversion technologies that can connect stranded natural gas to both conventional and transportation fuel markets. our proprietary gas-to-fuels ( gtf ) process offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels while bypassing conventional intermediate synthetic gasification technology. the base patent for this technology was awarded in 2007. during 2008, we entered into agreements with grt, inc., a delaware corporation, to cooperate on the advancement of gas-to-fuels-related technology. this transaction provides us with access to additional specialized technical and research personnel and lab facilities, and significantly expanded the portfolio of patents available to us via license and through a cooperative development program. in addition, we have acquired a 20 percent interest in grt, inc. also, during 2008, we completed construction of a facility to demonstrate operation of the fully integrated gtf process at a practical scale. we are evaluating the commercialization of this technology and have engaged an engineering contractor to provide engineering and design services for using the gtf technology on a commercial scale. in addition to gtf , we continue to evaluate the application of other natural gas technologies, including lng technology enhancements, gas hydrates and gas-to-liquids technology. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility and expectations for a gtf demonstration facility. factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. factors that could potentially affect the gtf demonstration facility include construction delays, start-up difficulties relating to scale-up in the process and unforeseen difficulties in our testing program related to moving from laboratory to practical scale. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 18 table of contents index to financial statements competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based upon statistics compiled in the 2008 global upstream performance review published by ihs herold inc., we rank ninth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2007 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries in north america. there are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. based upon the the oil &amp; gas journal 2009 worldwide refinery survey , we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2008. we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. we believe we compete with about 45 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 70 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; ten refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded jobbers and dealers; and approximately 280 retailers in the retail sale of refined products. (a jobber is a business who does not carry out refining operations, but who supplies refiner-branded products to gasoline stations or convenience stores. dealers refer to a retail service station or convenience store operator, affiliated with a brand identity.) we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. in recent years, several nontraditional fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business. our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. environmental matters the public policy committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. our corporate health, environment and safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving us or any of our properties. legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. the kyoto protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. canadian federal and provincial laws, the u.s. energy independence and security act of 2007, the european union requirements and california laws contain provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions. other climate change legislation and regulations in the united states, canada and abroad are in various stages of development or implementation. these regulations are further along in development in alberta, canada, and in the european union, where we have significant operations. our industry and businesses 19 table of contents index to financial statements throughout the united states are also awaiting the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) actions upon the remand of the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. usepa, which could have impacts on a number of air permitting and environmental regulatory programs. in july 2008, the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking ( anpr ) to address the supreme court decision and to seek public input on potential actions it may take to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. action by epa on the anpr is expected in 2009. there also is other pending litigation which could affect whether epa regulates greenhouse gas emissions. in addition, a new administration in the u.s. may choose to address greenhouse gas emissions through regulation, permitting or other action in 2009. our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases. likewise, emissions arise from our rm&amp;t operations, including the refining of crude oil and the transportation of crude oil and refined products. although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products) associated with any legislation, regulation, epa or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. private party litigation has also been brought against emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but we have not been named in those cases. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters. new laws are being enacted, and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air of particular significance to our refining operations are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in diesel fuel for off-road use. we have spent approximately $120 million between 2006 and 2008, and plan to spend approximately $50 million in 2009 on refinery investments to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use, in compliance with epa regulations. further, we have estimated that we may spend approximately $1 billion over a five-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with mobile source air toxics ii ( msat ii ) regulations relating to benzene content in refined products. we have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these requirements. our actual msat ii expenditures have totaled $76 million through december 31, 2008 and we expect to spend $200 million in 2009. the cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in 2009. the epa is in the process of implementing regulations to address current national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. in connection with these standards, the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, the epa proposed a rule in 2004 called the interstate air quality rule ( iaqr ) that would require significant emissions reductions in numerous states. the final rule, promulgated in 2005, was renamed the clean air interstate rule ( cair ). while the epa expects that states will meet their 20 table of contents index to financial statements cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units, states were to have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. significant uncertainty in the final requirements of this rule resulted from litigation (state of north carolina, et al. v. epa). in july 2008, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the cair in its entirety and remanded it to epa to promulgate a rule consistent with the court opinion. in december 2008, the court modified its july ruling to leave the cair in effect until epa develops a new rule and control program. it is expected that the cair will be significantly altered, and it could result in changes in emissions control strategies. our refinery operations are located in affected states, and some of these states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair. in addition, the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march 2008, and the epa has commenced the multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act. we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the epa has issued a revised rule and states have taken further action to implement that rule. we also cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the revised ozone standard until the implementing rules are established and judicial challenges over the revised ozone standard are resolved. water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of any such release, opa-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. opa-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90, and we have established spill prevention, control and countermeasures ( spcc ) plans for facilities subject to cwa spcc requirements. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm&amp;t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. in 2011, canada will implement a ban on the land application of certain wastes, and we are developing options to treat or dispose of these wastes consistent with these new restrictions. ongoing waste handling and disposal-related costs, however, are not expected to be material. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. see item 3. legal proceedings environmental proceedings other proceedings for a discussion of these sites. the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction 21 table of contents index to financial statements process which are placed in ponds. the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its on going reclamation work. the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies. in february 2009, the alberta energy resources conservation board issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. the aosp joint venture parties are reviewing this directive to determine the impact on the oil sands operations and the timeline for the required compliance. increased compliance costs may result if tailing pond reclamation technologies prove unsuccessful or the directive requires additional measures. other matters in 2007, the u.s. congress passed the energy independence and security act ( eisa ), which, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020, and contains a multiple-part renewable fuel standard ( rfs ). the rfs was 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, and is 11.1 billion gallons in 2009, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. in the near term, the rfs will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. the rfs presents production and logistic challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries. the rfs has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use. within the overall 36.0 billion gallon rfs, eisa establishes an advanced biofuel rfs that begins with 0.6 billion gallons in 2009 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs include 0.5 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2009, increasing to 1.0 billion gallons in 2012, and 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel in 2010, increasing to 16.0 gallons by 2022. the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations. we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels. the usx separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the usx separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the usx separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. in connection with the usx separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the usx separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the usx separation. the following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements. 22 table of contents index to financial statements financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the usx separation, united states steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. the financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. the agreement also obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. while no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, we have significant exposures to united states steel arising from the transaction discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 30,360 active employees as of december 31, 2008. of that number, 19,794 were employees of ssa, most of who were employed at our retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2012. negotiations are currently underway with the same union in texas 23 table of contents index to financial statements city with a contract expiration of march 31, 2009. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may

are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, or in refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products; utilization rates of refineries; natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain. lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves. the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group or third-party consultants we have retained. the estimates were calculated using liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices in effect as of december 31, 2008, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. any significant future price 25 table of contents index to financial statements changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. estimates of economically recoverable liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; and assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. the proved bitumen reserves information included in this report has also been derived from engineering estimates. reserves related to mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. proved reserves are measured by various testing and sampling methods. bitumen reserves as of december 31, 2008 were estimated by third-party consultants, using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and are subject to many of the same uncertainties discussed above, except that estimates of bitumen reserves are based on average annual prices consistent with industry practice in canada. the estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. future proved bitumen reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and taxation. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production 26 table of contents index to financial statements performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce our refining, marketing and transportation profitability and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall refining, marketing and transportation profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and facility security. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in the united states, canada and european union. these include proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. these actions could result in increased costs to (1) operate and maintain our facilities, (2) install new emission controls at our refineries and other facilities and (3) administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon tax program. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous 27 table of contents index to financial statements substances. for example, we have been, and presently are, a defendant in various litigation and other proceedings involving products liability and other claims related to alleged contamination of groundwater with the oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether, or mtbe. we may become involved in further litigation or other proceedings, or we may be held responsible in existing or future litigation or proceedings, the costs of which could be material. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. in 2007, the u.s. congress passed the energy independence and security act ( eisa ), which, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020, and contains a multiple-part renewable fuel standard ( rfs ). the rfs was 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, and is 11.1 billion gallons in 2009, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. in the near term, the rfs will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. the rfs presents production and logistics challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries. the rfs has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use. the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations. we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage per gallon or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels. in addition, tax incentives and other subsidies have made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may have reduced and may further reduce refined product margins and refined products ability to compete with renewable fuels. the recent distress in the financial markets may impact our ability to obtain future financing and could adversely affect entities with which we do business. in the future we may require financing to grow our business. financial institutions participate in our revolving credit facility and provide us with business insurance coverage, cash management services, commercial letters of credit and short-term investments. the recent distress affecting the financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go bankrupt has reduced levels of activity in the credit markets. this could diminish the amount of financing available to companies. in addition, such turmoil in the financial markets could significantly increase our costs associated with borrowing. our liquidity and our ability to access the credit or capital markets may also be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. continuing turmoil in the financial markets could make it more difficult for us to access capital, sell assets, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. in addition, there could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on us, including insolvency of customers, key suppliers and other counterparties to our commodity and foreign exchange derivative instruments. worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 63 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2008 was derived from production outside the united states and 70 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2008, were located outside the united states. all of our bitumen production and proved reserves are located in canada. in addition, a significant portion of the feedstock requirements for our refineries is satisfied through supplies originating in saudi arabia, kuwait, canada, mexico and various other foreign countries. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. there are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. 28 table of contents index to financial statements continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the united states and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, severe weather and labor disputes. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision, acts of piracy and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. there has been a trend in recent years of litigation by attorneys general and other government officials seeking to recover civil damages from companies. we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. 29 table of contents index to financial statements if ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland. as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland in 2005, marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to ashland interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions. however, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service. if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland. in that event, our indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland. we are required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland, which could be material. we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions. under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two baskets, as described below: basket one this applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32 percent (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland. the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one. upon specified events related to ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two. in addition, basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two. because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland pre-transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two. the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a with and without basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group. thus, if the marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland. because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group tax liability for a particular year. this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation, ashland is required to repay 30 table of contents index to financial statements such compensation to marathon. in the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc that was previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland. under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or, in some jurisdictions, less than fair consideration or valuable consideration ; and the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. in connection with our transactions with ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of marathon common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland shareholders. in order to help establish that ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired. we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to ashland existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverage. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) ashland receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) ashland solvency, it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon, united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $513 million as of december 31, 2008, including accrued interest of $8 million. if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel. in that event, our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel. the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. 31 table of contents index to financial statements many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly those where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. this could affect our operational performance, financial position and reputation. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 69 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict, target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, bitumen and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the usx separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the usx separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001, and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions, map is wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. on october 18, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of western oil sands inc. ( western ). western primary asset was a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of alberta, canada. the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include western results from october 18, 2007. western oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment. 2 table of contents index to financial statements segment and geographic information our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and by-products; 3) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states; and 4) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. we conduct exploration, development and production activities in ten countries: the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, gabon, indonesia, ireland, libya, norway and the united kingdom. our 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 211 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2008 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 1,016 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2008 worldwide net sales averaged 381 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe. exploration in the united states during 2008, we drilled 71 gross (48 net) exploratory wells of which 60 gross (42 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 60 wells, 3 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 12 gross (3 net) exploratory wells of which 11 gross (3 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 11 wells, 5 gross (1 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2008. united states the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area. at the end of 2008, we had interests in 103 blocks in the gulf of mexico, including 97 in the deepwater area. we have been awarded 42 blocks on which we were the high bidder in the federal outer continental shelf lease sales no. 205 and 206 conducted by the u.s. minerals management service ( mms ) in late 2007 and early 2008. our initial net investment in these blocks was $343 million. we own 100 percent of fifteen of the blocks. we acquired the remaining blocks in conjunction with partners. our plans call for initial drilling on some of these leases in 2009 and 2010. in 2008, a successful appraisal well was drilled on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508 after a 2005 discovery. we hold a 25 percent outside-operated interest in the stones prospect. in the third quarter of 2008, we announced a gulf of mexico deepwater discovery on the gunflint prospect located on mississippi canyon block 948. we own a 13 percent outside-operated interest in the prospect. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the prospect. in 2008, we successfully completed our first horizontal well in the woodford shale resource play in the anadarko basin of oklahoma. we are currently participating in additional horizontal wells in the area where we hold 30,000 net acres. we hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the u.s. in the appalachian basin we hold 65,000 net acres in the marcellus shale resource play in pennsylvania and west virginia. we hold 25,000 net acres, primarily in texas, in the haynesville shale resource play located in north louisiana and east texas. initial drilling on some of these leases is planned for 2009. angola offshore angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in block 32. through december 2008, 28 discoveries on these blocks have been announced, including the portia and dione discoveries on angola block 31 in 2008. 3 table of contents index to financial statements norway we hold interests in over 510,000 gross acres offshore norway, including production license 505 ( pl 505 ) that was awarded in january 2009. in 2009, exploration drilling is expected to commence on additional prospects with the potential to be tied back to the alvheim complex. indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3d seismic acquisition in may 2008. we expect to begin exploratory drilling in early 2010. additionally, in october 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the bone bay block offshore indonesia. the bone bay block is 200 miles southeast of our pasangkayu block. current exploration plans for bone bay call for the acquisition of seismic data starting in 2010, followed by drilling in 2011. we are the operator of a drilling rig consortium that has secured a two-year contract for a deepwater exploration drilling rig. the rig will be used for deepwater exploration activities by us and by five other companies in indonesia. the participants have the right to extend this rig commitment. we continue to participate in joint study agreements in indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. we completed two joint study agreements in 2008. equatorial guinea during 2004, we announced the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, in which we hold a 63 percent operated interest, and the corona well on block d, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline. libya we hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2008 included the drilling of three wells, all of which were successful. most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration-stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. initial test drilling on the 100 percent interest birchwood prospect positively confirmed bitumen presence with additional test drilling required to confirm reservoir quality. united kingdom we have a 45 percent interest in five exploratory u.k. onshore coal seam gas ( csg ) licenses. drilling has been completed in five exploration wells in three of the licenses. one test well was completed in 2007 and three lateral wells for production testing were drilled in 2008. we and our partners were awarded 11 new blocks for csg exploration and potential future development during the 13th onshore licensing round in 2008. after the 2008 licensing our interest covers 520,000 acres. we are the operator of these new licenses and have a 55 percent working interest. production (including development activities) united states our u.s. operations accounted for 30 percent of our 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 44 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. during 2008, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 23 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 36 percent of our total u.s. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 20 mmcfd of natural gas, representing five percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales. at year end 2008, we held interests in six producing fields and five platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which we operate one platform. hurricanes gustav and ike impacted gulf of mexico operations in the latter part of the third quarter of 2008, resulting in approximately 9.5 net mboepd being shut-in during the quarter. the ewing bank development resumed production in october 2008, but the outside-operated ursa and troika fields were shut-in for repairs until november 2008 and january 2009, respectively, impacting fourth quarter sales by approximately 7 mboepd. we have a 65 percent working interest in ewing bank, a four percent overriding royalty interest in ursa and a 50 percent working interest in troika. we own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in the petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. the petronius platform also provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. for example, petronius processes liquid hydrocarbons from our perseus field which commenced production in april 2005 and is located five miles from the platform. 4 table of contents index to financial statements the neptune development in the gulf of mexico commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in july 2008. we hold a 30 percent outside-operated working interest in this development located on atwater valley area in the gulf of mexico, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the development plan included seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform and six wells have been drilled and completed. in october 2008, development of the droshky discovery, located in the gulf of mexico on green canyon block 244, was authorized by our board of directors. the initial droshky discovery well and two sidetracks were drilled in 2007, followed in 2008 by a second delineation and sidetrack well. the project will consist of development wells, which will be tied back to the nearby third-party owned and operated bullwinkle platform. we have secured a rig to begin drilling in 2009, and first production is targeted for 2010. net sales after royalties are expected to peak at about 45 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 43 mmcfd of natural gas. we hold a 100 percent working interest in droshky. also in october 2008, development of the ozona prospect, located in the gulf of mexico on garden banks block 515 was authorized by our board of directors. we have secured a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby outside-operated auger platform. first production is expected in 2011. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. in 2008, our net natural gas sales from alaska averaged 126 mmcfd, representing 28 percent of our total u.s. net natural gas sales volumes. our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 19 mbpd and 123 mmcfd in 2008. our wyoming net natural gas sales decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of natural field declines, partially offset by new wells in the wamsutter field and powder river basin areas. development of the powder river basin continued in 2008 with 100 operated wells drilled, which was down from the 170 wells drilled in 2007. additional development of our southwest wyoming interests continued in 2008 where we participated in the drilling of six wells. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas and north louisiana, with combined net sales of 137 mmcfd in 2008, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the permian basin of southeast new mexico and west texas, with net sales of 11 mbpd in 2008. we hold 320,000 acres in the williston basin (the bakken shale resource play). the majority of the acreage is located in north dakota with the remainder in eastern montana. this represents a substantial position in the bakken shale where approximately 225 locations will be drilled over the next four to five years. we currently have four operated drilling rigs running and ended 2008 with december average net sales of 8.2 mboepd. we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. our plans include drilling approximately 150 wells over the next five years. drilling and production commenced in late 2007. we currently have one operated drilling rig running and ended 2008 with december average net sales of 10 mmcfd. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. the east brae platform hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 26 percent working interest. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the brae area averaged 12 mbpd in 2008. net brae natural gas sales averaged 119 mmcfd, or 21 percent, of our international natural gas sales volumes in 2008. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area and the third-party beryl area and has a 5 table of contents index to financial statements total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline and has the capacity for almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the britannia, atlantic and cromarty fields. in the u.k. atlantic margin, we own a 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. net sales from the foinaven fields averaged 12 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 6 mmcfd of natural gas in 2008. norway norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed above. we were approved for our first operatorship on the norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate seven licenses, including the pl 505, which was awarded in january 2009. the operated alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf commenced production in june 2008. the complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ( fpso ) with subsea infrastructure. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas transported to the sage system using a new 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. first production to the complex was from the alvheim development which is comprised of the kameleon and kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. at the end of 2008, the alvheim development included ten producing wells and two water disposal wells. the nearby vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. the two vilje development wells were drilled and completed in 2007. additionally, in 2007, the norwegian government approved a plan for development and operation to develop the volund field as a subsea tie-back to the alvheim complex. the volund development will consist of three production wells and one water disposal well, all to be drilled in the 2009 and 2010. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent working interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in late 2009. in addition, we hold a 28 percent outside-operated interest in the gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of norway, where a successful appraisal well was drilled in 2006. in january 2009, the operator announced a development concept that includes a fixed processing platform with seven production wells that would be tied to existing facilities on the sleipner field. a final investment decision is expected in 2009. on october 31, 2008, we closed the sale of our non-core, outside-operated interests (24 percent of heimdal field, 47 percent of vale field and 20 percent of skirne field) and associated undeveloped acreage in offshore norway. ireland in december 2008, we announced an agreement to sell our wholly-owned subsidiary which owns our producing properties in ireland. closing is subject to customary closing conditions. properties included in the sale are our 100 percent working interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale natural gas fields and our 87 percent operated working interest in the seven heads natural gas field in the celtic sea offshore ireland. also included is a 100 percent interest in our gas storage business which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the southwest kinsale field. we own a 19 percent working interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off ireland northwest coast, where six of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. four of these wells were completed and tested at the end of 2008. terminal construction and offshore pipe installation are currently underway and onshore pipeline installation is planned to commence in 2009. the operator expects first production from the field in late 2010 or early 2011. equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea during 2008, net liquid hydrocarbon sales average 41 mbpd or 28 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 366 mmcfd, or 64 percent of our international natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2008 included 26 mbpd of condensate. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant. alba field natural gas is supplied to the lpg plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price. during 2008, a gross 883 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and our net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2008 included 11 mbpd of lpg and 4 mbpd of secondary condensate produced by alba plant llc. 6 table of contents index to financial statements as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ). ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. alba field dry natural gas, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. during 2008, a gross 94 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 565 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba reservoir for later production. angola the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the psvm development. key contracts were awarded and construction work commenced in the second half of 2008. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned for the psvm development. other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. seven of the block 32 discoveries form a potential development in the eastern area of that block. libya we resumed operations in libya in 2006, holding a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the waha concessions. net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 46 mbpd in 2008 compared to 45 mbpd in 2007. the 2008 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya represented 31 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. net natural gas sales in libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2008. gabon we are the operator of the tchatamba south, tchatamba west and tchatamba marin fields offshore gabon with a 56 percent working interest. net sales in gabon averaged 6 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2008. production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at tchatamba marin, with the processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility. other matters during the first quarter of 2008, we relinquished our interest in an exploration and production license in sudan, and as a result, we no longer have any interests in sudan. we ceased efforts to pursue exploration opportunities in ukraine and closed our kiev office in the third quarter of 2008. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, the equatorial guinea discoveries, the timing of production from the woodford shale resource play, the droshky and ozona developments in the gulf of mexico, the volund development, the sale of a subsidiary which owns producing properties in ireland and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. except for the volund development, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments on blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola, and the equatorial guinea discoveries could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. factors that could affect the sale of the subsidiary include customary closing conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 7 table of contents index to financial statements reserves at december 31, 2008, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1,195 million boe, of which 43 percent were located in organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) countries. the following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years. estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves at december 31 developed developed and undeveloped 2008

of reserves in place (b) (3 ) end of year 1,195 (a) additions were principally in norway, the gulf of mexico and libya. (b) the sale of outside-operated properties in norway was the most significant disposition. during 2008, we transferred 126 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, were $1,189 million, $1,250 million and $1,010 million. of the 289 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2008, 64 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 19 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2008. as of december 31, 2008, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves for the years 2009 through 2011 are projected to be $1,244 million, $508 million and $262 million. the above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas 8 table of contents index to financial statements reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for a discussion of the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation process, see item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk). results for 2008 include a full year of operations in comparison to two and one-half months of operation in 2007. bitumen was produced at an average rate of 25 mbpd in 2008. production and processing levels were adversely impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance, reliability issues and the implementation of a revised tailings management plan that impacted ore grade, which also increased operating costs. rm&amp;t segment income decreased $898 million in 2008 from 2007, primarily a result of a decrease in our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon from 18.48 cents in 2007 to 11.66 cents in 2008. the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin decline was consistent with the market indicators (crack spreads) in the midwest and gulf coast regions. in addition, manufacturing expenses were higher in 2008 due primarily to higher energy costs and maintenance activities. included in the refining and wholesale marketing gross margins were pretax derivative losses of $87 million in 2008 and $899 million in 2007. the variance primarily reflects falling crude futures prices in the second half of 2008, as well as the fact that we no longer use derivatives to mitigate domestic crude oil acquisition price risk. for 46 table of contents index to financial statements a more complete explanation of our strategies to manage market risk related to commodity prices, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. we averaged 944 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2008 and 1,010 mbpd in 2007. total refinery throughputs averaged 1,151 mbpd in 2008 compared to 1,224 mbpd in 2007. crude and total throughputs were lower in 2008 than in 2007 in part due to the effect hurricane gustav and ike had on u.s. gulf coast operations in 2008. the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the rm&amp;t segment for 2008 and 2007. rm&amp;t operating statistics 2008 2007 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1166 $ 0.1848 refined products sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) 1,352 1,410 (a) sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs (including transportation), purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. ig segment income increased $170 million, or 129 percent in 2008 from 2007. the increase in income was primarily related to a full year of operation of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea, which commenced operations in may 2007. we hold a 60 percent interest in the facility. segment expenses increased slightly in 2008 as we continue to develop new technologies. in 2008, we spent $92 million on gas commercialization technologies, including completing construction of a gas-to-fuels demonstration plant. such expense in 2007 was $42 million. consolidated results of operations: 2007 compared to 2006 revenues are summarized in the following table. (in millions) 2007 2006 e&amp;p $ 9,155 $ 9,010 osm 221 rm&amp;t 56,075 55,941 ig 218 179 segment revenues 65,669 65,130 elimination of intersegment revenues (885 ) (688 ) gain (loss) on long-term u.k. gas contracts (232 ) 454 total revenues $ 64,552 $ 64,896 items included in both revenue and costs and expenses: consumer excise taxes on petroleum products and merchandise $ 5,163 $ 4,979 matching crude oil and refined product buy/sell transactions settled in cash: e&amp;p 16 rm&amp;t 127 5,441 total buy/sell transactions included in revenues $ 127 $ 5,457 e&amp;p segment revenues increased $145 million in 2007 from 2006. the 2007 increase was primarily related to increased international crude oil marketing activities. higher liquid hydrocarbon realized prices were not sufficient to offset the impact of sales volume declines as illustrated in the table below. both liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes from domestic operations decreased in 2007 primarily due to normal production declines in the gulf of mexico and permian basin, while international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were lower primarily because our libya sales returned to normal levels compared to 2006, which included volumes owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations there. while international natural gas sales volumes increased, the majority of the increase was due sales to egholdings lng production facility in equatorial guinea that began operations in the second quarter of 2007. this increase in fixed-price sales volumes also contributed to the decline in our average international natural gas realizations. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of lng produced by egholdings, as well as methanol produced by ampco is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. 47 table of contents index to financial statements e&amp;p operating statistics 2007 2006 net liquid hydrocarbon sales (thousands of barrels per day) (a) united states 64 76 europe (b) 33 35 africa (b) 100 112 total international (b) 133 147 worldwide continuing operations 197 223 discontinued operations (c) 12 worldwide 197 235 net natural gas sales (millions of cubic feet per day) (d)(e) united states 477 532 europe 216 243 africa 232 72 total international 448 315 worldwide 925 847 total worldwide sales (thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day) continuing operations 351 365 discontinued operations 12 worldwide 351 377 average realizations (f) liquid hydrocarbons (dollars per barrel) united states $ 60.15 $ 54.41 europe 70.31 64.02 africa 66.09 59.83 total international 67.15 60.81 worldwide continuing operations 64.86 58.63 discontinued operations 38.38 worldwide $ 64.86 $ 57.58 natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) united states $ 5.73 $ 5.76 europe 6.53 6.74 africa 0.25 0.27 total international 3.28 5.27 worldwide $ 4.54 $ 5.58 (a) includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.

(f) excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments and the unrealized effects of u.k. natural gas contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. e&amp;p segment revenues included derivative losses of $15 million in 2007 and gains of $25 million in 2006. excluded from e&amp;p segment revenues were losses of $232 million in 2007 and gains of $454 million in 2006 related to natural gas sales contracts in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. osm segment revenues totaled $221 million in 2007, reflecting sales for the period subsequent to the october 18, 2007, western acquisition date. revenues during this period were reduced by $53 million of unrealized losses on derivative instruments held by western at the acquisition date intended to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude oil. revenues were also negatively impacted by a mid-november fire and the subsequent curtailment of operations at the scotford upgrader. maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december. rm&amp;t segment revenues increased $134 million in 2007 from 2006, while the portion related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $5,314 million. matching buy/sell transactions arise from arrangements in which we agree to buy a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or refined product to be delivered to a specified location 48 table of contents index to financial statements while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of the same commodity at a specified location to the same counterparty. prior to april 1, 2006, all matching buy/sell transactions were recorded as separate sale and purchase transactions, or on a gross basis. for contracts entered into on or after april 1, 2006, the income effects of matching buy/sell transactions are reported in cost of revenues, or on a net basis. transactions under contracts entered into before april 1, 2006 continued to be reported on a gross basis until their termination. this accounting change had no effect on net or segment income but the amounts of revenues and cost of revenues recognized after april 1, 2006 are less than the amounts that would have been recognized under previous accounting practices. the decrease in revenues from matching buy/sell transactions was a result of the change in accounting for these transactions effective april 1, 2006, discussed above. excluding matching buy/sell transactions, 2007 revenues increased primarily as a result of higher refined product prices. income from equity method investments increased $154 million in 2007 from 2006. income from the lng production facility in equatorial guinea accounts for most of the increase for 2007, as it began operations in may 2007 and delivered 24 cargoes during the year. cost of revenues increased $6,689 million in 2007 from 2006. the increase was primarily in the rm&amp;t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil, refinery charge and blendstocks and purchased refined products. the increase was also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses, primarily planned maintenance projects, or turnarounds, in 2007. purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $5,247 million in 2007 from 2006 as a result of the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above. depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $95 million in 2007 from 2006. the increase in 2007 primarily relates to the addition of the oil sands mining assets recorded as a result of the western acquisition, increased accretion of asset retirement obligations associated with international e&amp;p properties and increased depreciation related to various refinery improvements in 2006 and 2007, such as our low-sulfur diesel projects. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $99 million in 2007 from 2006. the 2007 expense increases were primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity. contingency accruals also contributed to the 2007 increase. exploration expenses increased $89 million in 2007 from 2006. exploration expenses related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $233 million and $166 million in 2007 and 2006. net interest and other financial income or costs reflected $41 million of income for 2007, a favorable change of $4 million from 2006. included in net interest and other financial income or costs were foreign currency transaction gains of $2 million and $16 million for 2007 and 2006. gain on foreign currency derivative instruments in 2007 represents gains on foreign currency derivative instruments entered to limit our exposure to changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate related to the cash portion of the purchase price for western. these derivative instruments were settled on october 17, 2007. provision for income taxes decreased $1,121 million in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to the $2,130 million decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes. the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2007 was primarily a result of the $193 million benefit of applying the canadian income tax rate reductions enacted subsequent to our acquisition of western to the applicable net deferred tax liabilities. these tax rates will decrease from 32 percent to 25 percent by 2012. the following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for continuing operations for 2007 and 2006. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 2007 2006 statutory u.s. income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits 9.8 10.1 state and local income taxes, net of

contents index to financial statements discontinued operations related to the exploration and production businesses which were sold in june 2006. after-tax gains on the disposal of $8 million and $243 million were also included in discontinued operations for 2007 and 2006. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. segment results: 2007 compared to 2006 as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we sold our russian oil exploration and production businesses during 2006. the activities of these operations have been reported as discontinued operations and therefore are excluded from segment results for all periods presented. segment income or loss for 2007 and 2006 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table.

(b) other deferred tax adjustments in 2006 represent a benefit recorded for cumulative income tax basis differences associated with prior periods. united states e&amp;p income decreased $250 million, or 29 percent, in 2007 from 2006. the decrease was primarily due to the revenue decline discussed above. in addition, exploration expenses were $105 million higher in 2007 than in 2006, primarily as a result of expensing non-commercial wells on the flathead prospect in the gulf of mexico in 2007. international e&amp;p income decreased $24 million in 2007 from 2006. the revenue decrease associated with lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes discussed above had the most significant impact on pretax income. osm segment loss totaled $63 million in 2007, reflecting results for the period subsequent to the october 18, 2007, western acquisition date. this loss includes a $40 million after-tax unrealized loss on derivative instruments held by western at the acquisition date intended to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude oil. segment income was also impacted by a mid-november fire and subsequent curtailment of operations at the scotford upgrader. maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. the scotford upgrader returned to operation in late december. rm&amp;t segment income decreased $718 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily a result of a decrease in our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon from 22.88 cents in 2006 to 18.48 cents in 2007. though the market-based crack spreads for 2007 were stronger than in 2006, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin declined primarily due to the significant and rapid increase in our crude oil costs during 2007, including the impact of derivatives, and lagging wholesale price realizations. our refining and marketing wholesale gross margin was further reduced by higher manufacturing costs related to planned maintenance at several refineries. in addition to the lower refining and wholesale gross margin, segment income was impacted by higher operating and administrative expenses. 50 table of contents index to financial statements included in the refining and wholesale marketing gross margins were pretax derivative losses of $899 million in 2007 and gains of $400 million in 2006. for a more complete explanation of our strategies to manage market risk related to commodity prices, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. we averaged 1,010 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2007 and 980 mbpd in 2006. our reported crude oil refining capacity increased to 1,016 mbpd in 2007 from 974 mbpd in 2006 due to overall efficiency gains in the operation of the refining units, reflecting the cumulative effect of regular maintenance, capital improvements and other process optimization efforts. the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the rm&amp;t segment for 2007 and 2006. rm&amp;t operating statistics 2007 2006 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1848 $ 0.2288 refined products sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) 1,410 1,425 (a) sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs (including transportation), purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. ig segment income increased $116 million in 2007 from 2006. during 2007, construction of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea was completed ahead of schedule and on budget. the increase in 2007 segment income over the previous year was largely due to the facility beginning operations in may 2007 and delivering 24 cargoes during the year. additionally, income from our equity method investment in ampco was higher in 2007 on increased methanol production due to plant downtime in 2006 and higher realized prices in 2007. in 2006, a $17 million pretax loss was recognized as a result of the renegotiation of a technology agreement and income from our equity method investment in ampco was lower due to plant downtime during a planned turnaround and subsequent compressor repair. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity cash flows net cash provided from operating activities totaled $6,782 million in 2008, compared to $6,521 million in 2007 and $5,488 million in 2006. the $261 million increase in 2008 primarily reflects the impact of higher average realized prices. the $1,033 million increase in 2007 primarily reflects working capital changes partially offset by lower net income. net cash used in investing activities totaled $5,435 million in 2008, compared with $8,102 million in 2007 and $2,955 million in 2006. significant investing activities include capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and asset disposals. capital expenditures by segment for continuing operations for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table. (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 e&amp;p united states $ 2,036 $ 1,354 $ 1,302 international 1,077 1,157 867 total e&amp;p 3,113 2,511 2,169 osm 1,038 165 rm&amp;t 2,954 1,640 916 ig 4 93 307 corporate 37 57 41 total $ 7,146 $ 4,466 $ 3,433 capital expenditures for multiple years are impacted by the following projects. in our e&amp;p segment, development and completion of the alvheim/vilje project affected our capital expenditures in 2006, 2007 and to a lesser extent in 2008. similarly, our angola exploration and development projects impacted all three years. in our rm&amp;t segment, the expansion of our garyville, louisiana refinery commenced with front-end engineering and design ( feed ) in 2006 followed by construction in 2007 and 2008. also in rm&amp;t, the expansion and upgrading 51 table of contents index to financial statements of our detroit, michigan refinery commenced with feed in 2007 and construction in 2008. integrated gas spending in 2006 and through may 2007 reflects the completion of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea. new capital spending in 2008 was primarily related to the ongoing aosp expansion 1 in the osm segment, and in u.s. exploration and development projects primarily in the gulf of mexico. acquisitions in 2007 consist primarily of the $3,907 million cash portion of the western acquisition purchase price, net of the $44 million of cash acquired. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the western acquisition. in 2006, acquisitions primarily included cash payments of $718 million associated with our re-entry into libya. disposal of assets totaled $999 million, $137 million and $134 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006. in 2008, disposal of assets included proceeds from the sale of our outside-operated interests and related undeveloped acreage in norway and our share of ptc. disposal of assets included proceeds from the sale of our interests in two lng tankers in alaska in 2007 and proceeds from the sale of 90 percent of our interest in syrian natural gas fields in 2006. disposals for all years included proceeds from the sale of various domestic producing properties and ssa stores. disposal of discontinued operations of $832 million in 2006 related to the sale of our russian exploration and production businesses in june 2006. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,193 million in 2008, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $184 million in 2007 and cash used in financing activities of $2,581 million in 2006. sources of cash in 2008 included the issuance of $1.0 billion in senior notes. sources of cash in 2007 included the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes and borrowings of $578 million from the norwegian export credit agency. significant uses of cash in financing activities in all years were common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plan, dividend payments and debt repayments. significant noncash transactions during 2007 included the issuance of $1.0 billion of 5.125 percent fixed rate revenue bonds (marathon oil corporation project) series 2007a, with a maturity date of june 1, 2037. the proceeds from the bonds, along with interest income, are held in trust to be disbursed to us upon our request for reimbursement of expenditures related to our garyville, louisiana refinery expansion. through december 31, 2008, such reimbursements have totaled $1,032 million. the $1.0 billion obligation is reflected as long-term debt and the remaining $16 million of trusteed funds, including interest income earned to date, is reflected as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2008. liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, and our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility. because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, share repurchase program, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. capital resources credit arrangements and borrowings at december 31, 2008, we had $7,087 million in long term debt outstanding. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor corporation, moody investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+ (outlook stable), baa1 (outlook stable), and bbb+ (outlook negative). should one or all of these agencies decide to downgrade our ratings, it could become more difficult and more costly for us to issue new debt or commercial paper. we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. at december 31, 2008, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our u.s. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility. 52 table of contents index to financial statements effective april 3, 2008, we amended our revolving credit facility, extending the termination date on $2,625 million from may 2012 to may 2013. the remaining $375 million continues to have a termination date of may 2012. no single lender holds more than 10 percent of the $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. on march 12, 2008, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at 5.9 percent with a maturity date of march 15, 2018. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually beginning september 15, 2008. subsequent to year end 2008, on february 17, 2009, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at 6.5 percent with a maturity date of february 15, 2014 and $800 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at 7.5 percent with a maturity date of february 15, 2019. interest on both issues is payable semi-annually beginning august 15, 2009. asset sales in 2008, we commenced a review of our portfolio of assets with the intent of monetizing those assets which are either mature or otherwise non-strategic. through december 31, 2008, net proceeds of $999 million have been received from the sale of assets identified in this review. shelf registration on july 26, 2007, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 22 percent at december 31, 2008 and 2007. this includes $485 million of debt that is serviced by united states steel.

following the issuance of the $1.0 billion of revenue bonds by the parish of st. john the baptist, the proceeds were trusteed and will be disbursed to us upon our request for reimbursement of expenditures related to the garyville refinery expansion. the trusteed funds are reflected as other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2008 and 2007. capital requirements capital spending we have approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $5,738 million for 2009, which represents a 24 percent decrease from our 2008 spending. additional details related to the 2009 budget are discussed in outlook capital, investment and exploration budget. 53 table of contents index to financial statements other significant expected cash outflows we plan to make contributions of up to $439 million to our pension plans during 2009. as of december 31, 2008, $98 million of our long-term debt is due in the next twelve months. dividends of $0.96 per common share or $681 million were paid during 2008. on february 2, 2009, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.24 cents per share on marathon common stock, payable march 10, 2009, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 18, 2009. share repurchase program since january 2006, our board of directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. as of december 31, 2008, we had repurchased 66 million common shares at a cost of $2,922 million. we have not made any purchases under the program since august 2008. purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. this program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. the program authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. the timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales and cash from available borrowings. our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. the discussion of liquidity above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital, investment and exploration spending and a review of our portfolio of assets. the forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading or refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. factors that could affect the review of our portfolio of assets include the identification of buyers and the negotiation of acceptable prices and other terms, as well as other customary closing conditions. the forward-looking statements about our common share repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or refining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. 54 table of contents index to financial statements contractual cash obligations the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31, 2008. (in millions) total 2009 2010- 2011 2012- 2013 later years long-term debt (excludes interest) (a)(b) $ 6,880 $ 68 $ 279 $ 1,718 $ 4,815 sale-leaseback financing (a)(k) 297 14 55 44 184 capital lease obligations (a)(k) 360 26 37 55 242 operating lease obligations (a) 967 176 233 180 378 operating lease obligations under sublease (a) 21 5 10 6 purchase obligations: crude oil, feedstock, refined product and ethanol contracts (c) 9,955 8,322 662 479 492 transportation and related contracts 1,657 430 401 223 603 contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment 4,070 1,949 1,242 389 490 lng terminal operating costs (d) 153 13 25 25 90 service and materials contracts (e) 1,567 379 442 205 541 unconditional purchase obligations (f) 50 8 14 14 14 commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) (g) 21 19 2 total purchase obligations 17,473 11,120 2,788 1,335 2,230 other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (h) 3,562 500 704 871 1,487 total contractual cash obligations ( i )(j) $ 29,560 $ 11,909 $ 4,106 $ 4,209 $ 9,336 (a) upon the usx separation, united states steel assumed certain debt and lease obligations, including $415 of long-term debt obligations related to industrial revenue bonds. the financial matters agreement provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the usx separation, united states steel will provide for marathon discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. such amounts are included in the above table because we remain primarily liable. (b) we anticipate cash payments for interest of $426 million for 2009, $842 million for 2010-2011, $646 million for 2012-2013 and $3,603 million for the remaining years for a total of $5,517 million. of these, we anticipate cash payments for interest of $23 million for 2009, $45 million for 2010-2011, $32 million for 2012-2013 and $207 million for the later years to be made by united states steel. (c) the majority of these contractual obligations as of december 31, 2008, relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of 2009. these contracts include variable price arrangements. (d) we have acquired the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal. the agreement primary term ends in 2021. pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the terminal. (e) service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (f) we are a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with alliance pipeline. this agreement was used by alliance pipeline to secure its financing. this arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. (g) commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs. (h) primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. we have estimated projected funding requirements through 2018. also includes certain tax obligations recorded in accordance with fin 48. ( i ) includes $497 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel. (j) this table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $ 965 million. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. (k) during the interim period between lease inception and effective date, long-term debt costs equal estimated or reported construction costs as of the end of the reporting period, not the minimum lease payment/rentals. off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s.. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. 55 table of contents index to financial statements we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees, united states steel and others. these arrangements are described in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements. transactions with related parties we own a 63 percent working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea. onshore equatorial guinea, we own a 52 percent interest in an lpg processing plant, a 60 percent interest in an lng production facility and a 45 percent interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. we sell our natural gas from the alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. the methanol that is produced is then sold through another equity method investee. sales of refined petroleum products to our 50 percent equity method investee, ptc, which was sold in october 2008, accounted for 2.5 percent or less of our total sales revenue for 2008, 2007 and 2006. we believe that these transactions with related parties have been conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. obligations associated with the separation of united states steel we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the usx separation. united states steel obligations to us are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. if united states steel fails to satisfy these obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. as of december 31, 2008, we have identified the following obligations that have been assumed by united states steel: $415 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $8 million at december 31, 2008. we anticipate united states steel will make future interest payments of $23 million for 2009, $45 million for 2010-2011, $32 million for 2012-2013 and $207 million for the later years. $37 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2008. $32 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel clairton coke-making facility, with a term extending to 2012. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2008. $21 million of operating lease obligations, all of which was assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee with respect to all obligations of united states steel to the limited partners of the clairton 1314b partnership, l.p., which was terminated on october 31, 2008. upon termination of the partnership, we were not released from our obligations under guarantee. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $513 million, obligations of $492 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2008, (current portion $23 million; long-term portion $469 million). the remaining $21 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. united states steel has restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. in its form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2008, united states steel reported that it was in compliance with all debt covenants, but that the current global recession may affect its 56 table of contents index to financial statements ability to comply with those covenant and conditions in the future. such circumstances could trigger a need for united states steel to modify or replace credit agreements on less favorable terms that could adversely affect its flexibility, cash flow and profitability. outlook capital, investment and exploration budget our board of directors approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $5,738 million for 2009, which includes budgeted capital expenditures of $5,547 million. this represents a 24 percent decrease from 2008 spending. the focus of our 2009 budget is to maintain solid production performance, enhance our downstream business and provide necessary investments in mid- and long-term growth projects. the budget includes worldwide exploration and production spending of $2,468 million. a significant amount of this budget, 45 percent, is targeted on projects that will sustain and grow production in the short-term, including domestic assets such as those in the bakken shale and piceance basin and international development projects like volund in norway. mid-term production growth projects such as droshky and ozona in the gulf of mexico and emerging resource plays in the marcellus and woodford shales account for 34 percent of the 2009 budget. long-term projects will require about 20 percent of budgeted funds in 2009. the psvm development on angola block 31, the gudrun development in norway, as well as exploration in the gulf of mexico, angola, norway and indonesia are our significant long-term projects. the budget includes $887 million for the oil sands mining segment in 2009, primarily for the continuation of expansion 1. this is slightly lower than 2008 spending due in part to the stronger u.s. dollar and to the expected deferral of some nonessential projects. the budget includes $1,944 million for rm&amp;t projects, with about 52 percent budgeted for the garyville refinery expansion and 17 percent for the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. the remainder of the budget is allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements, notably the mobile source air toxics ( msat ) regulations that will be effective at the beginning of 2011. the remaining $439 million relates to capitalized interest and corporate activities. the forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. exploration major exploration activities are currently underway or under evaluation worldwide. angola we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in offshore block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in offshore block 32. we plan to participate in four to six exploration or appraisal wells in these deepwater blocks in 2009. four potential development hubs have been identified on these two blocks and we continue to evaluate our discoveries for future development. norway we hold interests in over 510,000 acres offshore norway and plan to continue our exploration efforts there. in 2009, exploration drilling is expected to commence on additional prospects with the potential to be tied back to the alvheim complex. gulf of mexico we plan to participate in one to three exploration wells during 2009. the exploration success on the shenandoah prospect was announced in february 2009 by the operator. we own a 10 percent outside-operated interest in this prospect. additional prospects have been identified in the gulf of mexico deepwater leases acquired in 2007 and 2008. these projects make up the core of our 2009 through 2010 gulf of mexico exploration drilling plans. 57 table of contents index to financial statements indonesia we continue to evaluate seismic data on the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia and plan to start exploratory drilling there in early 2010. we are the operator of this block and hold a 70 percent interest. evaluation of the bone bay block offshore indonesia, which we were awarded in 2008, continues with plans to collect seismic data in 2010. exploratory drilling on this block could begin in 2011. we have a 49 percent interest in the bone bay block and are the operator. u.s. onshore we announced a discovery in the woodford shale in january 2009. we hold 30,000 net acres in the woodford shale resource play in the anadarko basin of oklahoma and plan to participate in more horizontal wells in 2009. we also hold prospective acreage in two emerging shale resource plays in the u.s. in the appalachian basin we hold 65,000 net acres in the marcellus shale resource play in pennsylvania and west virginia. we also hold 25,000 net acres, primarily in texas, in the haynesville shale resource play in north louisiana and east texas . our plans call for initial drilling on some of these leases in 2009. equatorial guinea we are evaluating development scenarios for the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block, one of which includes production through the alba field infrastructure. we own a 63 percent interest in the alba block and serve as operator. production during 2008, several of our development projects were completed and began producing. we have approved new development projects, are evaluating others and will continue working on ongoing projects in 2009. angola in 2008 we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater psvm development project. the development is comprised of the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries. key contracts were awarded and construction work commenced in the second half of 2008. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned for the psvm development. first production is targeted for 2012 with a design capacity of about 150,000 gross bpd norway tie back of the volund field offshore norway to the alvheim/vilje production facility continues with first production expected in late 2009. we own a 65 percent interest in volund and serve as operator. in addition, we hold a 28 percent outside-operated interest in the gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of norway, where a successful appraisal well was drilled in 2006. in january 2009, the operator announced a development concept that includes a fixed processing platform with seven production wells that would be tied to existing facilities on the sleipner field. a final investment decision is expected in 2009. gulf of mexico the droshky and ozona developments in deepwater gulf of mexico were approved in 2008. rig capacity has been secured for droshky development drilling which is expected to begin in february 2009 with first production targeted for 2010. the project will consist of four development wells which will be tied back to the nearby third-party owned and operated bullwinkle platform. we own a 100 percent working interest in droshky. ozona development on garden banks block 515 will begin in 2009, with first production expected in 2011. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. u.s. onshore we continue drilling on resource plays in the piceance basin of colorado and the williston basin of north dakota and eastern montana (the bakken shale resource play). in the piceance basin, drilling and production commenced in late 2007. plans are to drill 150 wells during the next five years. more than 100 operated wells have already been drilled with plans to drill approximately 225 additional wells during the next five years. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola and the droshky discovery in the gulf of mexico, the timing of production from the neptune development, the droshky discovery, the alvheim/vilje development, the volund field and the corrib project. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. except for the neptune, alvheim/vilje and volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the possible developments of the droshky discovery and blocks 31 and 32 offshore angola could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 58 table of contents index to financial statements oil sands mining the aosp expansion 1 continues in 2009 and is expected to begin operations in the 2010 to 2011 timeframe. the expansion includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine and expansion of the scotford upgrader, along with construction of common infrastructure sized to support future mining expansions. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated completion of the aosp expansion. factors which could affect the expansion include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. refining, marketing and transportation the garyville refinery expansion is expected to be completed and ready for start up in the fourth quarter of 2009. total projected costs are now estimated to be $3.35 billion (excluding capitalized interest). this expansion will increase the refinery crude oil throughput capacity by 180 mbpd and will enable the refinery to provide an additional 7.5 million gallons of clean transportation fuels to the market each day. permits were obtained and construction commenced for the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our detroit, michigan, refinery in 2008. due to delays in the projected production from canadian oil sands and current market conditions, we have reevaluated the project construction schedule and now plan to complete this project in mid-2012. we now forecast the project will cost $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest), or about 15 percent more than the original budget, due primarily to additional costs associated with the project deferral as well as a scope change that will allow the refinery to process heavier and more acidic crude oils. through these investment projects, we expect to more than double our coking capacity by 2012, which should lead to lower feedstock costs and increased margins. in addition, as the new units comprising the garyville refinery expansion reach full capacity utilization, we anticipate the percentage of distillate produced to increase. we estimate that we will spend approximately $200 million in 2009 to comply with msat ii regulations. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the planned expansion of the garyville refinery, the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project and msat ii regulations compliance costs. some factors that could affect the garyville, detroit and msat ii projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, other risks customarily associated with construction projects. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas our net worldwide lng sales volumes are expected to average 5,700 to 6,400 metric tonnes per day in 2009. we continue to invest in the development of new technologies to supply new energy sources. in 2008, we completed construction of a facility to demonstrate operation of the fully integrated gas-to-fuels process at a practical scale. we are evaluating the commercialization of this technology and have engaged an engineering contractor to provide engineering and design services for using our proprietary gtf technology on a commercial scale. the above discussion contains forward looking statements with respect to future lng sales and the potential commercialization of our gtf technology. projected lng sales volumes are based upon a number of assumptions, including unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and government or military response thereto and other operating and economic considerations. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we 59 table of contents index to financial statements believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. our environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were: (a) (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 capital $ 421 $ 199 $ 176 compliance operating and maintenance 379 287 309 remediation (b) 26 25 20 total $ 826 $ 511 $ 505 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines regarding the definition of environmental expenditures. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. our environmental capital expenditures accounted for six percent of capital expenditures for continuing operations in 2008, four percent in 2007 and five percent in 2006. we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be $373 million or seven percent of capital expenditures in 2009. predictions beyond 2009 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $426 million in 2010; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, see item 1. business environmental matters and item 3. legal proceedings. critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. 60 table of contents index to financial statements estimated net recoverable reserve quantities proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. during 2008, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 23 million boe (less than 2 percent of the beginning of the year reserve estimate). our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates prepared by these teams are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10(a)(2),(3) and (4) of regulation s-x and sfas no. 25, suspension of certain accounting requirements for oil and gas producing companies (an amendment of financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) statement no. 19), and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of sfas no. 69, disclosures about oil and gas producing activities (an amendment of fasb statements 19, 25, 33 and 39). the sec has amended its disclosure requirements effective for annual reports on form 10-k for fiscal years ending on or after december 31, 2009 see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting standards not yet adopted for additional information. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are based on prices at december 31, 2008. reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group. any change to proved reserves estimates in excess of 2.5 million boe on a total-field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer. the corporate reserves group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions. third-party consultants are engaged to prepare independent reserve estimates for fields that comprise the top 80 percent of our total reserves over a rolling four-year period. we met this goal for the four-year period ended december 31, 2008. for 2006 and thereafter, we established a tolerance level of 10 percent for third-party reserve estimates such that the third-party consultants discontinue their estimation activities once their results are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. if, after this re-examination, the third-party consultants cannot arrive at estimates within our tolerance, we adjust our reserve estimates as necessary to achieve estimates within our tolerance level. this independent third-party reserve estimation process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2008, 2007, or 2006. the reserves of the alba field in equatorial guinea comprise approximately 38 percent of our total proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2008. the reserves of the next five largest asset groups the waha concessions in libya, the alvheim/vilje development offshore norway, the droshky development in green canyon block 244 in the gulf of mexico, the oregon basin field in the rocky mountain area of the united states and the foinaven development in the north sea comprise 32 percent of our total proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. depreciation and depletion of producing liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved developed reserves. the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant. on average, a five percent increase in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.47 per barrel, which would increase pretax 61 table of contents index to financial statements income by approximately $66 million annually, based on 2008 production. on average, a five percent decrease in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.52 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $73 million annually, based on 2008 production. proved bitumen reserves we acquired a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp in alberta, canada with the acquisition of western in october 2007. oil sands mining operations at the aosp are outside the scope of sfas nos. 25 and 69 and sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x; therefore, bitumen production and reserves are not included in our supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. as discussed, the sec has recently issued a release amending these disclosures see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting standards not yet adopted for additional information. the estimated amount of proved bitumen reserves affects the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income. the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets used in testing oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets for impairment also rely, in part, on estimates of proved bitumen reserves. reserves related to oil sands mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. proved bitumen reserves as of december 31, 2008 were based on a third-party consultant estimate using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, except that estimates of bitumen reserves are based on annual average prices for 2008, which is believed to be consistent with industry practice in canada. depreciation and depletion of most oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading assets is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved bitumen reserves. on average, a five percent increase in estimated bitumen reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.98 per barrel and would result in an increase in pretax income of approximately $9 million annually, based on 2008 production. on average, a five percent decrease in estimated bitumen reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.52 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $5 million annually, based on 2008 production. fair value estimates on january 1, 2008, we adopted sfas no. 157 for those financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. sfas no. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. it does not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date, while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. see note 17 of the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. in february 2008, the fasb issued fasb staff position ( fsp ) fas 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no. 157, which deferred the effective date of sfas no. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. this includes impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and initial measurement of asset retirement obligations, asset exchanges, pensions, business combinations and partial sales of proved properties. the primary impact from the adoption of sfas no. 157 at january 1, 2008, related to the fair value measurement of our derivative instruments. additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 62 table of contents index to financial statements significant uses of fair value measurements include: allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions, assessment of impairment of long-lived assets, assessment of impairment of goodwill, and recorded value of derivative instruments. acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. the fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. impairment assessments of goodwill and long-lived assets fair value calculated for the purpose of testing for impairment of our long-lived assets and goodwill is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. a significant amount of judgment is involved performing these fair value estimates for goodwill and long-lived assets since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. significant assumptions include: future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices . our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. although liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. to estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the world-wide resource base, depletion rates, and opec production policies. we believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies, and vehicle stocks. such price estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. there has been significant volatility in the liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and estimates of such price curves are inherently imprecise. estimated recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen . this is based on a combination of proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves. these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants. because of their very nature, probable and possible reserves are less precise than those of proved reserves. we evaluate our probable and possible reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. reserves are adjusted as new information becomes available. expected timing of production . production forecasts are based on a combination of proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves based on engineering studies. the actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. future margins on refined products produced and sold . our estimates of future product margins are based on our own analysis of various supply and demand factors, which includes, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures, and economic conditions. such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. discount rate commensurate with the risks involved . we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. future capital requirements . this is based on authorized spending and internal forecasts. 63 table of contents index to financial statements we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. however, actual results may differ from those projections. the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located. long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field for e&amp;p assets, project level for oil sands mining assets, refinery and associated distribution system level or pipeline system level for refining and transportation assets, or site level for retail stores. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pricing and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. that is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. derivatives we record all derivative instruments at fair value. a large volume of our commodity derivatives are exchange-traded and require few assumptions in arriving at fair value. in our e&amp;p segment, we have two long-term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the united kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. these contracts, which expire in september 2009, were entered into in the early 1990s in support of our investments in the east brae field and the sage pipeline. the contract price is reset annually in october and is indexed to a basket of costs of living and energy commodity indices for the previous twelve months. consequently, the prices under these contracts do not track forward natural gas prices. the fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price to the expected sales volumes under these contracts for the shorter of the remaining contract terms or 18 months. adjustments to the fair value of these contracts result in non-cash charges or credits to income from operations. the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price may fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect income from operations. a 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would decrease the fair value of these derivatives by $21 million, while a 10 percent decrease in natural gas prices would increase the fair value of these derivatives by $21 million in 2008. our osm segment holds crude oil options expiring december 2009, which were designed to protect against price decreases on portions of future synthetic crude oil sales. the fair value of these options is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model that uses prices from the active commodity market and a market volatility calculated by a third-party service. a 10 percent increase in crude oil prices would decrease the fair value of these options by $4 million, while a 10 percent decrease in crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these options by $13 million in 2008. expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. 64 table of contents index to financial statements in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, we consider proved and risk-adjusted probable reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and natural gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the releasing of an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies in the event the forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plans and our unfunded u.s. retiree health care plan due to the different projected liability durations of 8 years and 13 years. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary discount rate modeling tool. this tool applies a yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical aa yield curve. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual discount rates from 1.5 to 30 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. each issue is required to have at least $150 million par value outstanding. the top quartile bonds are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield curve. of the assumptions used to measure the december 31, 2008 obligations and estimated 2009 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. a 0.25 percent decrease in the discount rates of 6.9 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 6.85 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $66 million and $21 million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $9 million and $3 million. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the u.s. funded pension plans and 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent debt securities for the international funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our assumptions are compared to those of peer companies and to historical returns for reasonableness and appropriateness. a 0.25 percent decrease in the asset rate of return assumption would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. 65 table of contents index to financial statements note 23 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the balance sheets as of december 31, 2008, and 2007. in 2006, we made certain plan design changes which included an update of the mortality table used in the plans definition of actuarial equivalence and lump sum calculations and a 20 percent retiree cost of living adjustment for annuitants. this change increased our benefit obligations by $117 million. there were no plan design changes in 2008 or 2007. contingent liabilities we accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. for instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. accounting standards not yet adopted in december 2008, the sec announced that it had approved revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures. the new disclosure requirements include provisions that: introduce a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. this new definition allows companies to include in their reserve base volumes from unconventional resources. such unconventional resources include bitumen extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and shale formations. report oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior 12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each month, rather than year-end prices. the sec indicated that they will continue to communicate with the fasb staff to align their accounting standards with these rules. the fasb currently requires a single-day, year-end price for accounting purposes. permit companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary basis. in the past, proved reserves were the only reserves allowed in the disclosures. require companies to provide additional disclosure regarding the aging of proved undeveloped reserves. permit the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. replace the existing certainty test for areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a productive well with a reasonable certainty test. require additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company overall reserve estimation process. additionally, disclosures regarding internal controls surrounding reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor will be mandatory. require separate disclosure of reserves in foreign countries if they represent more than 15 percent of total proved reserves, based on barrels of oil equivalents. 66 table of contents index to financial statements if finalized, we will apply the new disclosure requirements in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ending december 31, 2009. the new rules may not be applied to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required. we are currently in the process of evaluating the new requirements. also in december 2008, the fasb issued fsp fas 132(r)-1, employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets which provides guidance on an employer disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. this would require additional disclosures about investment policies and strategies, the reporting of fair value by asset category and other information about fair value measurements. the fsp is effective january 1, 2009 and early application is permitted. upon initial application, the provisions of fsp fas 132(r)-1 are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. we will expand our disclosures in accordance with fsp fas 132(r)-1 in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ending december 31, 2009; however, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in november 2008, the fasb ratified eitf 08-6, equity method investment accounting considerations ( eitf 08-6 ) which clarifies how to account for certain transactions involving equity method investments. the initial measurement, decreases in value and changes in the level of ownership of the equity method investment are addressed. eitf 08-6 is effective on a prospective basis for our fiscal year beginning january 1, 2009 and interim periods within the years. early application by an entity that has previously adopted an alternative accounting policy is not permitted. since this standard will be applied prospectively, adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in june 2008, the fasb issued fsp on emerging issues task force ( eitf ) 03-6-1, determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities ( fsp eitf 03-6-1 ) which provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share ( eps ) under the two-class method. fsp eitf 03-6-1 is effective january 1, 2009, and all prior-period eps data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) will be adjusted retrospectively to conform to its provisions. early application of fsp eitf 03-6-1 is not permitted. although restricted stock awards meet this definition of participating securities, we do not expect application of fsp eitf 03-6-1 to have a significant impact on our reported eps. in april 2008, the fasb issued fsp on fas 142-3 ( fsp fas 142-3 ) which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. fsp fas 142-3 is effective on january 1, 2009, early adoption is prohibited. the provisions of fsp fas 142-3 are to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date, except for the disclosure requirements which must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the effective date. since this standard will be applied prospectively, adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in march 2008, the fasb issued sfas no. 161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no. 133. this statement expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments to provide information regarding (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no. 133 and its related interpretations and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. to meet these objectives, the statement requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. this standard is effective january 1, 2009. the statement encourages but does not require disclosures for earlier periods presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption. we will expand our disclosures in accordance with sfas no. 161 beginning in the first quarter of 2009; however, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 141 (revised 2007), business combinations ( sfas no. 141 (r) ). this statement significantly changes the accounting for business combinations. under sfas no.141(r), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling 67 table of contents index to financial statements interest in the acquiree at their acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. the statement expands the definition of a business and is expected to be applicable to more transactions than the previous business combinations standard. the statement also changes the accounting treatment for changes in control, step acquisitions, transaction costs, acquired contingent liabilities, in-process research and development, restructuring costs, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of a business combination and changes in income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date. accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations will impact tax expense instead of impacting recorded goodwill. additional disclosures are also required. sfas no. 141(r) is effective on january 1, 2009, for all new business combinations. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. also in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no. 51. this statement establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. specifically, this statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (sometimes called a minority interest) is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent equity. it requires that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income statement. sfas no. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. in addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, based on the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. additional disclosures are required that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. sfas no. 160 is effective january 1, 2009, and early adoption is prohibited. the statement must be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented in consolidated financial statements. we do not have significant noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, and therefore, adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 68 table of contents index to financial statements item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. we employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. we believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. commodity price risk our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses. we also may utilize the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions. our e&amp;p segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the natural gas price risk during the time that the natural gas is held in storage before it is sold or on natural gas that is purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production. we also may use commodity derivative instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on portions of our future sales of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas when it is deemed advantageous to do so. the majority of these derivatives are measured at fair value with a market approach using broker quotes or third-party pricing services, which have been corroborated with data from active markets, making them a level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described by sfas no. 157. unrealized gains and losses on certain natural gas contracts in the u.k. that are accounted for as derivative instruments are excluded from e&amp;p segment income. these contracts originated in the early 1990s and expire in september 2009. the contract prices are reset annually in october based on the previous twelve-month changes in a basket of energy and other indices. consequently, the prices under these contracts do not track forward natural gas prices. the reported fair value of the u.k. natural gas contracts is measured with an income approach by applying the difference between the contract price and the u.k. forward natural gas strip price to the expected sales volumes for the shorter of the remaining contract term or 18 months. such an internally generated model is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. our osm segment may use commodity derivative instruments to protect against price decreases on portions of our future sales of synthetic crude oil when it is deemed advantageous to do so. the reported fair value of these crude oil options, which expire december 2009, is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model, which is an income approach that utilizes prices from the active commodity market and market volatility calculated by a third-party service. because a third-party service is used, and their inputs represent unobservable market data, these are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. our rm&amp;t segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments on a selective basis to mitigate crude oil price risk during the time that crude oil inventories are held before they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. we also use derivative instruments in our rm&amp;t segment to manage price risk related to refined petroleum products, feedstocks used in the refining process and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products and fixed price sales contracts. we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate crude oil price risk between the time that crude oil purchases are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products, but we have decreased our use of derivatives in this manner as described further below. the majority of these derivatives are exchange-traded contracts for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and ethanol measured at fair value with a market approach using the close-of-day settlement prices for the market making them a level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. when broker accounts are covered by master netting agreements the broker deposits are netted against the value to arrive at the fair values of level 1 and level 2 commodity derivatives. generally, commodity derivative instruments used in our e&amp;p segment qualify for hedge accounting. as a result, we do not recognize in net income any changes in the fair value of those derivative instruments until the 69 table of contents index to financial statements underlying physical transaction occurs. we have not qualified commodity derivative instruments used in our osm or rm&amp;t segments for hedge accounting. as a result, we recognize in net income all changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in those operations. open commodity derivative positions as of december 31, 2008 and sensitivity analysis at december 31, 2008, our e&amp;p segment held open derivative contracts to mitigate the price risk on natural gas held in storage or purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production in amounts that were in line with normal levels of activity. at december 31, 2008, we had no significant open derivative contracts related to our future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and therefore remained substantially exposed to market prices of these commodities. the osm segment holds crude oil options which were purchased by western for a three year period (january 2007 to december 2009). the premiums for the purchased put options had been partially offset through the sale of call options for the same three-year period, resulting in a net premium liability. payment of the net premium liability is deferred until the settlement of the option contracts. as of december 31, 2008, the following put and call options were outstanding: option expiration date 2009 option contract volumes (barrels per day) : put options purchased 20,000 call options sold 15,000 average exercise price (dollars per barrel ): put options $ 50.50 call options $ 90.50 in the first quarter of 2009, we sold derivative instruments at an average exercise price of $50.50 which effectively offset the open put options for the remainder of 2009. at december 31, 2008, the number of open derivative contracts held by our rm&amp;t segment was lower than in previous periods. starting in the second quarter of 2008, we decreased our use of derivatives to mitigate crude oil price risk between the time that domestic spot crude oil purchases are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. instead, we are addressing this price risk through other means, including changes in contractual terms and crude oil acquisition practices. additionally, in previous periods, certain contracts in our rm&amp;t segment for the purchase or sale of commodities were not qualified or designated as normal purchase or normal sales under generally accepted accounting principles and therefore were accounted for as derivative instruments. during the second quarter of 2008, as we decreased our use of derivatives, we began to designate such contracts for the normal purchase and normal sale exclusion. 70 table of contents index to financial statements sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations ( ifo ) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of december 31, 2008, is provided in the following table. the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would result in the largest incremental decrease in ifo when applied to the commodity derivative instruments used to hedge that commodity. incremental decrease in ifo assuming a hypothetical price change of (a) (in millions) 10% 25% commodity derivative instruments (b) crude oil $ 16 (d) $ 15 (d) natural gas 21 (c) 53 (c) refined products 6 (d) 15 (d) (a) we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity. effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis. amounts reflect hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in closing commodity prices for each open contract position at december 31, 2008. included in the natural gas impacts above were $21 million and $53 million for hypothetical price changes of 10 percent and 25 percent related to the u.k. natural gas contracts accounted for as derivative instruments. we evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. changes to the portfolio after december 31, 2008, would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented above. (b) the number of net open contracts for the e&amp;p segment varied throughout 2008, from a low of 3 contracts on october 1, 2008, to a high of 472 contracts on january 29, 2008, and averaged 181 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the rm&amp;t segment varied throughout 2008, from a low of 13 contracts on may 16, 2008, to a high of 15,599 contracts on march 17, 2008, and averaged 3,019 for the year. the number of net open contracts for the osm segment varied throughout 2008, from a low of 12,775 contracts on december 31, 2008, to a high of 24,500 contracts on january 1, 2008, and averaged 18,646 for the year. the commodity derivative instruments used and positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects. (c) price increase. (d) price decrease. interest rate risk we are impacted by interest rate fluctuations which affect the fair value of certain financial instruments. we manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing the mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt in our portfolio. as of december 31, 2008, we had multiple interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $450 million, designated as a fair value hedge, which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. the weighted average floating rate on these swap agreements is libor plus 2.060 percent. sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2008, is provided in the following table.

(1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the usx separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the usx separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001, and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions, map is wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. on october 18, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of western oil sands inc. ( western ). western primary asset was a 20 percent interest in the outside-operated athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of alberta, canada. the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include western results from october 18, 2007. western oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining 1 table of contents segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment. segment and geographic information our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil; 3) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis; and 4) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, transports and markets crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. the e&amp;p, osm and ig segments comprise our upstream operations. the rm&amp;t segment comprises our downstream operations. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. at the end of 2009, we were conducting oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in eight countries: the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, indonesia, libya, norway and the united kingdom. during 2009, we exited gabon and ireland. we plan to begin exploration activities in poland during 2010. our 2009 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 243 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2009 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 941 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2009 worldwide net sales averaged 400 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe. these volumes exclude 7 mboepd related to discontinued operations. in the united states during 2009, we drilled 76 gross (50 net) exploratory wells of which 72 gross (48 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 72 wells, 6 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 9 gross (1 net) exploratory wells of which 6 gross (1 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. all 6 wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2009. north america united states our u.s. operations accounted for 26 percent of our 2009 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 40 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. offshore the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area. during 2009, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 24 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 20 mmcfd of natural gas. at year end 2009, we held interests in seven producing fields and four platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which we operate one platform. we operate the ewing bank 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the lobster, oyster and arnold fields. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. we own a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. an additional development well was successfully completed in 2009. the petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. 2 table of contents the neptune development commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in july 2008. we hold a 30 percent working interest in this outside-operated development located on atwater valley 575, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the completed phase i development included six subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. phase ii development activities have begun and the first well in this program was successfully drilled and completed in late 2009. development of the droshky discovery, located on green canyon block 244, continued in 2009. droshky phase i is a four well liquid hydrocarbon development with first production targeted for mid-year 2010. ongoing development activities include running intelligent well completions, installation of the subsea facilities and topside modifications to the third-party bullwinkle host platform. expected net peak production is approximately 50 mboepd. we hold a 100 percent operated working interest in droshky. development of the ozona prospect, located on garden banks block 515, has also continued. we have secured a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby third-party auger platform. first production is expected in 2011. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. in 2008, we drilled a successful liquid hydrocarbon appraisal well on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508. we hold a 25 percent interest in the outside-operated stones prospect. in the third quarter of 2008, we announced deepwater liquid hydrocarbon discovery on the gunflint prospect located on mississippi canyon block 948. we own a 13 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater liquid hydrocarbon discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 20 percent interest in the outside-operated prospect. in december 2009, we began drilling the flying dutchman well, on green canyon block 511, where we have 63 percent ownership and are the operator of this liquid hydrocarbon prospect. in addition to the prospects listed above, we held interests in 103 blocks in the gulf of mexico at the end of 2009, including 97 in the deepwater area. our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in 2010 and 2011. onshore we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. we have operated and outside-operated interests in 10 fields and hold a 51 to 100 percent working interest in each. in 2009, our net natural gas sales from alaska averaged 87 mmcfd. typically, our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. in 2009, we drilled six wells in alaska and plan to drill four to six wells per year during 2010 through 2012. we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. our plans include drilling approximately 65 wells over the next five years. we currently have one operated drilling rig running and averaged net sales of 15 mmcfd in 2009. we hold 336,000 acres over the bakken shale oil play in the williston basin of north dakota with a working interest of approximately 84 percent. approximately 225 locations will be drilled over the next four to five years. we are evaluating other potential horizons above and below the middle bakken. we currently have four operated drilling rigs running in our bakken program. we exited 2009 with average net sales of 11 mboepd in december. in 2008, we successfully completed our first horizontal well in the woodford shale natural gas play in the anadarko basin of oklahoma. we are currently participating in additional horizontal wells in the area where we hold 52,000 net acres. in 2009, we drilled 13 wells, five of which were operated. we plan to drill 10 to 15 wells in 2010. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas and north louisiana, with combined net sales of 121 mmcfd in 2009, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the permian basin of west texas, with net sales of 8 mbpd in 2009. in june 2009, we completed the sales of our operated and a portion of our outside-operated permian basin producing assets in new mexico and west texas. we still retain interests in 12 permian basin fields. we hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the u.s. in the appalachian basin we hold 70,000 net acres in the marcellus shale natural gas play in pennsylvania and west virginia. we drilled five wells 3 table of contents in 2009 and plan to drill another 8 to 12 wells in 2010. in louisiana and east texas, we hold 25,000 net acres in the haynesville shale natural gas play, where we drilled one well in 2009. we plan to drill three to four wells in 2010. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 18 mbpd and 113 mmcfd in 2009. we plan to drill 24 wells in 2010. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. the three potential in-situ developments are namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest, birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest, and ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest. initial test drilling on the birchwood prospect positively confirmed bitumen presence with additional test drilling required to confirm reservoir quality. africa equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field which is offshore equatorial guinea. during 2009, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 42 mbpd, or 17 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 426 mmcfd, or 45 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2009 included 30 mbpd of primary condensate. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price for the british thermal units used in the operations of the lpg plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and lpg. during 2009, a gross 943 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2009 included 4 mbpd of secondary condensate and 12 mbpd of lpg produced by alba plant llc. as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ), both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) production facility, both located on bioko island. dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. during 2009, a gross 115 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 647 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected back into the alba field for later production. we hold a 63 percent operated interest in the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the corona well on block d. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline. angola offshore angola, we hold 10 percent interests in block 31 and block 32, both of which are outside-operated. the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the psvm development. the psvm development will utilize a floating, production, storage and offloading ( fpso ) vessel. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned with the drilling of the first three to four development wells planned in 2010. first production is anticipated in late 2011 to early 2012. other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. eight of the block 32 discoveries form a potential development in the eastern area of that block. we expect first production on block 32 in 2015 or 2016. 4 table of contents libya we hold a 16 percent interest in the outside-operated waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2009 included the drilling of four wells. one well is waiting on completion, one was dry and abandoned, and two are currently drilling. we also drilled 5 development wells in libya during the year. net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 46 mbpd in 2009. the 2009 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya represented 19 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. net natural gas sales in libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2009. our faregh phase ii gas plant project is expected to deliver a gross 180 mmcfd of natural gas and 15 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons into the libyan domestic market. commissioning will begin in 2010, with startup planned for first quarter of 2011. europe norway norway is a growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed below. we were approved for our first operatorship on the offshore norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate eight licenses and hold interests in over 600,000 gross acres. the operated alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf commenced production in june 2008. the complex consists of an fpso with subsea infrastructure. improved reliability, combined with optimization work, increased the throughput of the fpso to 142 mbpd, up from the original design of 120 mbpd. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the existing u.k. scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system using a 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. first production to the complex was from the alvheim development which is comprised of the kameleon, east kameleon and kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. at the end of 2009, the alvheim development included ten producing wells and two water disposal wells. a phase 2 drilling program targeting three additional production wells, and a phase 2b drilling program with two additional production wells, is planned in 2010 through 2012. net sales for 2009 averaged 56 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 30 mmcfd of natural gas. the nearby outside-operated vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. during 2009, net liquid hydrocarbon sales from vilje averaged 12 mbpd. in june 2009, we completed the drilling program for the volund field as a subsea tieback to the alvheim complex. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated interest, is located approximately five miles south of the alvheim area and consists of one production well and one water disposal well. first production from volund was announced in september 2009. the volund owners have contracted for 25 gross mbpd (16 mbpd net) firm capacity on the alvheim fpso beginning in july 2010. until that date, volund will act as a swing producer, filling any available capacity and allowing the fpso to be fully utilized. also offshore norway, we and our partners announced the marihone and viper discoveries, both located within tie-back distance of the alvheim fpso. the marihone oil discovery is located in license pl340 about 12 miles south of the volund and alvheim fields. we hold a 65 percent operated working interest in marihone. the viper oil discovery is located immediately next to volund field in pl203, about 12 miles south of the alvheim fpso. we are the operator and hold a 65 percent interest in viper. conceptual development studies for both discoveries have begun. in addition, we hold a 28 percent interest in the outside-operated gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of norway. in january 2009, the operator announced a development concept that includes a fixed processing platform with seven production wells that would be tied to existing facilities on the sleipner field, and one water disposal well. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. a two well development program is scheduled in 2010 for west brae. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. the east brae platform hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the brae area 5 table of contents averaged 11 mbpd in 2009. net brae natural gas sales averaged 101 mmcfd, or 11 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes, in 2009. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. in the u.k. atlantic margin west of the shetland islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. net sales from the foinaven fields averaged 13 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 7 mmcfd of natural gas in 2009. we are upgrading the fpso which will extend the life of this project through 2021. we have a 45 percent interest in five exploratory u.k. onshore coal seam gas licenses. drilling has been completed in five exploration wells in three of the licenses. we also hold a 55 percent operated working interest in 11 blocks awarded in a 2008 bid round. our interest covers 520,000 gross acres. poland we have recently added a new opportunity to our portfolio, poland shale gas. in november we were awarded the 296,000 acre kwidzyn block, followed by the 249,000 acre orzechow block in december. the five and a half year exploration phase for each block includes 2d seismic and at least one well. we were awarded the 269,000 acre brodnica block in january 2010, and we continue to look for additional opportunities in poland. we hold a 100 percent interest and operatorship in all three blocks. other international indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3d seismic acquisition in may 2008. a mandatory 25 percent relinquishment was submitted to the indonesian government in september 2009 and upon approval, the block size will be reduced from 1.2 million gross acres to 872,400 gross acres. we expect to drill two wells in 2010. in october 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the bone bay block offshore sulawesi. an increase in ownership to 55 percent is pending indonesian government approval. the bone bay block covers an area of 1.23 million acres and is 200 miles southeast of our pasangkayu block. current exploration plans for bone bay call for the acquisition of seismic data starting in 2010, followed by drilling of one exploration well in 2011. in the second quarter of 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the kumawa block, our third indonesia offshore exploration block, located offshore west papua. an increase in ownership to 55 percent is pending indonesian government approval. the kumawa block encompasses 1.24 million acres. a 2d seismic survey is planned in the first quarter of 2010 and we expect to drill one exploration well in 2011-2012. we are the operator of a drilling rig consortium, with five other operators, that has secured a deepwater exploration drilling rig to drill exploratory wells in indonesia over a two-year period commencing in the second quarter of 2010. the participants have the right to extend this rig contract for up to one additional year. we continue to participate in joint study agreements in indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. we completed two joint study agreements in 2008 and have one in progress. divestitures angola in february 2010, we closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent interest in the outside-operated production sharing contract and joint operating agreement on block 32 offshore angola for $1.3 billion, excluding any purchase price adjustments, with an effective date of january 1, 2009. we retained a 10 percent interest in block 32. 6 table of contents gabon in december 2009, we closed the sale of our operated properties in gabon. net production from these operations averaged 6 mbpd in 2009. the results of our gabonese operations have been reported as discontinued operations. united states in june 2009, we completed the sale of our operated and a portion of our outside-operated permian basin producing assets in new mexico and west texas for net proceeds after closing adjustments of $293 million. a $196 million pretax gain on the sale was recorded. net production from these sold properties averaged 8,150 boepd in the first quarter of 2009. ireland in april 2009, we closed the sale of our operated properties offshore ireland, which consisted of our 100 percent working interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale natural gas fields and our 87 percent working interest in the seven heads natural gas field. net production from these operations averaged 5 mboepd in the first quarter of 2009. in july 2009 we closed the sale of our subsidiary holding our 19 percent interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development offshore ireland. as a result of these dispositions, our irish exploration and production businesses have been reported as discontinued operations. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the timing of production from the droshky and ozona developments in the gulf of mexico, the faregh phase ii gas plant, the psvm development on block 31 offshore angola and block 32 and other possible developments. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking

our acquisition of western in 2007, we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the aosp mining and extractions assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta and include the muskeg river mine which began bitumen production in 2003 and the jackpine mine which is currently under construction and anticipated to commence bitumen production in the second half of 2010. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. the upgrading assets are located at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. additional upgrading capacity is being constructed with an anticipated startup in late 2010 or early 2011. 9 table of contents in the second quarter of 2009, the operator of aosp offered three additional leases to the other joint venture partners for the muskeg river mine. terms of the transaction were as agreed in the original 1999 aosp joint venture agreement. we elected to participate in these leases and our net proved bitumen reserves increased 168 million barrels. see item 1. business reserves for comprehensive discussion of reserves related to our oil sands mining and conventional exploration and production operations. as of december 31, 2009, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross (45,000 net) acres. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile corridor pipeline. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the three major products that the scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil, heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. net synthetic crude oil sales were 32 mbpd in both 2009 and 2008, but were 4 mbpd in 2007. daily volumes for 2007 represent total volumes since the acquisition date over total days in the period. prior to our acquisition of western, the first fully integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved in 2006. expansion 1, which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine, addition of a new processing train at the scotford upgrading facility and development of related infrastructure, is on track and anticipated to begin mining operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010 or early 2011. when expansion 1 is complete, we will have more than 50 mbpd of production and upgrading capacity in the canadian oil sands. the timing and scope of potential future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review. the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of aosp expansion 1 and the timing of production. factors which could affect the expansion project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the aosp expansion could be further affected by commissioning and start-up risks associated with prototype equipment and new technology. reserves in december 2008, the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) announced revisions to its regulations on oil and gas reporting. in january 2010, the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update which was intended to harmonize the accounting literature with the sec new regulations. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the changes. the revised regulations were applied in estimating and reporting our reserves as of december 31, 2009, which totaled 1,679 mmboe. estimated reserve quantities the following table sets forth estimated quantities of our net proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2009. approximately 61 percent of our proved reserves are located in organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) countries. 10 table of contents under the new regulations, reserves are now disclosed by continent, by country, if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil-equivalent barrel basis represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent. reserve quantities previously reported for 2008 and 2007 have been reorganized into these geographic groupings below for comparability. north america africa europe december 31, 2009

(b) our businesses in ireland and gabon were sold in 2009. all periods have been recast to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. we previously reported osm segment reserves as bitumen because oil sands mining was not considered an oil and gas producing activity by the sec. proved bitumen reserves reported as of december 31, 2008 and 2007 were 388 mmboe and 421 mmboe. december 31, 2009 reserve quantities under the new regulations include 603 mmboe of proved synthetic crude oil (bitumen after upgrading excluding blendstocks) related to our oil sands mining operations. while the change from bitumen to synthetic crude oil is responsible for some of the 2008 to 2009 increase in reported osm segment reserves, the majority of the reserve increase is related to the three leases added to the muskeg river mine in the second quarter of 2009. there were no other significant changes to our proved reserves in 2009. the above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. the above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. preparation of reserve estimates our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x. beginning december 31, 2009, reserve estimates are based upon the average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2009. in previous periods, reserve estimates were based on prices at december 31. liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group, which includes our director of corporate reserves and her staff of reserves coordinators. reserves estimates are developed and reviewed by qualified reserves estimators ( qre ). qre are engineers or geoscientists with a minimum of a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of 3 years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed marathon qualified reserve estimator training course. the reserve coordinators review all reserves estimates for all fields with proved reserves greater than 3 million boe at a minimum of once every 3 years. any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 million boe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the director of corporate reserves. all other proved reserve changes must be approved by a reserve coordinator. 12 table of contents our director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and a master of business administration. her 35 years of experience in the industry include 24 with marathon. she is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the society of petroleum engineers ( spe ) oil and gas reserves committee ( ogrc ) since 2004, chairing in 2008 and 2009. as a member of the ogrc, she participated in the development of the petroleum resource management system ( prms ) and served on the technical program committee for a 2007 spe reserves estimation workshop: sharing the vision focusing on prms. she chaired the development of the ogrc comments on the sec proposed modernization of oil and gas reporting and was a member of the american petroleum institute ad hoc group that provided comments on the same topic. estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by glj petroleum consultants of calgary, canada, third-party consultants. a copy of their report is filed as exhibit 99.1 to this form 10-k. the engineer responsible for the estimates of our oil sands mining reserves has 31 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. he is a member of spe, having served as regional director 1998 through 2001 and is a registered practicing professional engineer in the province of alberta. audits of estimates third-party consultants are engaged to audit the in-house reserve estimates for fields that comprise the top 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. we met this goal for the four-year period ended december 31, 2009. we established a tolerance level of 10 percent for reserve audits such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. this resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. this process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2009, 2008, or 2007. netherland, sewell and associates, inc. ( nsai ) prepared an independent estimate of december 31, 2008 reserves for alba field. this reserve estimate was used by corporate reserves in much the same way third-party audits are now used. the nsai summary report is filed as exhibit 99.2 to this form 10-k. the senior members of the nsai team have over fifty years of industry experience between them, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. the team lead has a master of science in mechanical engineering and is a member of spe. the senior technical advisor has a bachelor of science in geophysics and is a member of the society of exploration geophysicists, the american association of petroleum geologists and the european association of geoscientists and engineers. both are licensed in the state of texas. ryder scott company ( ryder scott ) performed audits of several of our fields in 2009. their summary report on audits performed in 2009 is filed as exhibit 99.3 to this form 10-k. the team lead for ryder scott has over 18 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott. he has a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering, is a member of spe and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. the corporate reserves group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions. changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2009, 492 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, an increase of 203 mmboe from december 31, 2008, primarily due to the inclusion of synthetic crude oil. of the 492 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2009, 31 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in equatorial guinea that was sanctioned by the board of directors in 2004 and is expected to be completed in 2014. there are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years from now. projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in many situations such as behind-pipe zones where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. during 2009, we added 290 mmboe to proved undeveloped reserves and transferred 38 mmboe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. costs incurred for the periods ended december 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $792 million, $1,189 million and $1,250 million. 13 table of contents as of december 31, 2009, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2010 through 2014 are projected to be $1,083 million, $565 million, $244 million, $331 million, and $123 million. the above estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. net production sold north america africa europe disc. ops (b) total united states canada (a) total eg other total total year ended december 31, 2009 liquid hydrocarbon (mbpd) (c) 64 - 64 42 45 87 92 5 248 natural gas (mmcfd) (d)(e) 373 - 373 426 4 430 116 17 936 total production sold (mboed) 126 - 126 113 46 159 111 7 403 year ended december 31, 2008 liquid hydrocarbon (mbpd) (c) 63 - 63 40 47 87 55 6 211 natural gas (mmcfd) (d)(e) 448 - 448 366 4 370 129 37 984 total production sold (mboed) 138 - 138 101 48 149 77 12 376 year ended december 31, 2007 liquid hydrocarbon (mbpd) (c) 64 - 64 45 45 90 33 10 197 natural gas (mmcfd) (d)(e) 477 - 477 227 5 232 130 39 878 total production sold (mboed) 144 - 144 83 46 129 54 17 344 (a) before december 31, 2009, reserves related to oil sands mining were not included in the sec definition of oil and gas producing activities; therefore, synthetic crude oil production of 27 mbpd is not reported for 2009.

natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. in may 2007, egholdings completed construction of a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum ( mmtpa ) lng production facility on bioko island. lng from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 3.9 million metric tonnes in 2009. in 2009, we continued discussions with the government of equatorial guinea and our partners regarding a potential second lng production facility on bioko island. we also own a 30 percent interest in a kenai, alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant, and lease two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan. feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet. from the first production in 1969, we have sold our share of the lng plant production under long-term contracts with two of japan largest utility companies. in june 2008 we, along with our partner, received approval from the u.s. department of energy to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through march 2011. we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ampco owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field. gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 960,374 metric tonnes in 2009. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the united states. in addition to our expertise in utilizing existing gas technologies to manufacture and market products such as lng and methanol, we continue to conduct research to develop new leading-edge natural gas technologies. while existing known natural gas resources are much more abundant than the world remaining oil resources, natural gas is more difficult to transport to global markets without the use of advanced gas technologies. our gas-to-fuels ( gtf ) technology is one such promising technology. our gtf tm technology program is focused on converting natural gas into gasoline blendstocks and petrochemicals. global markets for these products are significantly larger than the global markets for either lng or methanol, further expanding the uses of natural gas. during 2009, we completed the initial run program of our newly-constructed gtf process demonstration unit, which was commissioned during 2008. this technology demonstration program has provided valuable information about materials of construction, process chemistry, and gtf plant operations. during 2008, we entered into agreements with grt, inc., a delaware corporation, to cooperate on the advancement of gas-to-fuels-related technology. this transaction provides us with access to additional specialized 15 table of contents technical and research personnel and lab facilities, and significantly expanded the portfolio of patents available to us via license and through a cooperative development program. in addition, we have acquired a 20 percent interest in grt, inc. the gtf tm technology is protected by an intellectual property protection program. the u.s. has granted 17 patents for the technology, with another 22 pending. worldwide, there are over 300 patents issued or pending, covering over 100 countries including regional and direct foreign filings. another innovative technology that we are developing focuses on reducing the processing and transportation costs of natural gas by artificially creating natural gas hydrates, which are more easily transportable than natural gas in its gaseous form. much like lng, gas hydrates would then be regasified upon delivery to the receiving market. we have an active pilot program in place to test and further develop a proprietary natural gas hydrates manufacturing system. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility. factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. refining, marketing and transportation we have refining, marketing and transportation operations concentrated primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeast regions of the u.s. we rank as the fifth largest crude oil refiner in the u.s. and the largest in the midwest. our operations include a seven-plant refining network and an integrated terminal and transportation system which supplies wholesale and marathon-brand customers as well as our own retail operations. our wholly-owned retail marketing subsidiary speedway superamerica llc ( ssa ) is the third largest chain of company-owned and -operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the u.s. and the largest in the midwest. refining we own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1.188 million barrels per day ( mmbpd ) of crude oil as of december 31, 2009. during 2009, our refineries processed 957 mbpd of crude oil and 196 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. the table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries as of december 31, 2009.

st. paul park, minnesota 74 total 1,188 our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, cumene, propane, propylene, sulfur and maleic anhydride. our garyville, louisiana, refinery is located along the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana between new orleans and baton rouge. the garyville refinery predominantly processes heavy sour crude oil into products 16 table of contents such as gasoline, distillates, sulfur, asphalt, propane, polymer grade propylene, isobutane and coke. our garyville refinery has earned designation as a u.s. occupational safety and health administration (osha) voluntary protection program (vpp) star site. the garyville major expansion project, completed on schedule during the fourth quarter of 2009, is currently being fully integrated into the base garyville refinery. as a result of the expansion, the refinery crude oil refining capacity has grown from 256 mbpd to 436 mbpd, making it among the largest crude oil refineries in the country. the expansion also improves scale efficiencies, feedstock flexibility and refined product yields. the expansion project cost approximately $3.9 billion (excluding capitalized interest). our catlettsburg, kentucky, refinery is located in northeastern kentucky on the western bank of the big sandy river, near the confluence with the ohio river. the catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, asphalt, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, propane, propylene and sulfur. our robinson, illinois, refinery is located in southeastern illinois. the robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, propane, propylene, sulfur and anode-grade coke. the robinson refinery has earned designation as an osha vpp star site. our detroit, michigan, refinery is located near interstate 75 in southwest detroit. it is the only petroleum refinery currently operating in michigan. the detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils, including canadian crude oils, into products such as gasoline, diesel, asphalt, slurry, propane, chemical grade propylene and sulfur. in 2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at this refinery, with a current projected cost of $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). this project will enable the refinery to process an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour crude oils, including canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 10 percent. construction began in the first half of 2008 and is presently expected to be complete in the second half of 2012. our detroit refinery is certified as a michigan vpp site, receiving rising star status, and expects to satisfy the requirements for star status in the first quarter of 2010. our canton, ohio, refinery is located approximately 60 miles southeast of cleveland, ohio. the canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel fuels, kerosene, propane, sulfur, asphalt, roofing flux, home heating oil and no. 6 industrial fuel oil. our texas city, texas, refinery is located on the texas gulf coast approximately 30 miles south of houston, texas. the refinery processes sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline, propane, chemical grade propylene, slurry, sulfur and aromatics. our st. paul park, minnesota, refinery is located in southeastern minnesota where it is one of only two refineries in the state. the st. paul park refinery processes predominantly canadian crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, asphalt, propane, propylene and sulfur. our st. paul park refinery is certified as a minnesota vpp site, receiving rising star status, and expects to satisfy the requirements for star status in 2010. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of crude oil, feedstocks and intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently. 17 table of contents the following table

most of the crude oil we refine through negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. our crude oil supply contracts are generally term contracts with market related pricing provisions. the following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years. the crude oil sourced outside of north america was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. of the u.s. and canadian sourced crude processed at our refineries, 33 mbpd, or four percent, was supplied by a combination of our

distribute our refined products through a variety of channels, including pipelines, trucks, railcars, ships and barges. refined products marketing and distribution we are a supplier of refined products to resellers and consumers within our 24-state market area in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. our market area includes approximately 4,600 marathon branded-retail outlets concentrated in the midwest and southeastern states. we currently own and distribute from 64 light product and 22 asphalt terminals. in addition, we distribute through 60 third-party terminals in our market area. our marine transportation operations include 16 towboats, as well as 183 owned and 8 leased barges that transport refined products on the ohio, mississippi and illinois rivers and their tributaries as well as the intercoastal waterway. we lease or own approximately 2,400 railcars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of refined products. in addition, we own over 120 transport trucks for the movement of light products. the following table sets forth, as a percentage of total refined product sales, sales of refined

and no. 1 and no. 2 fuel oils (including kerosene, jet fuel and diesel fuel) to wholesale marketing customers in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. we sold 51 percent of our gasoline volumes and 87 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2009. the demand for gasoline is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically being at its highest levels during the summer months. we have blended ethanol into gasoline for over 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were 60 mbpd in 2009, 54 mbpd in 2008 and 40 mbpd in 2007. the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. we sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our marketing territory, including: chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; milwaukee, wisconsin, and hartford, illinois. we also sell biodiesel-blended diesel in minnesota, illinois and kentucky. we produce propane at all seven of our refineries. propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers. we are a producer and marketer of petrochemicals and specialty products. product availability varies by refinery and includes benzene, cumene, dilute naphthalene oil, molten maleic anhydride, molten sulfur, propylene, toluene and xylene. we market propylene, cumene and sulfur domestically to customers in the chemical industry. we sell maleic anhydride throughout the united states and canada. we also have the capacity to produce 1,400 tons per day of anode grade coke at our robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry, and 5,500 tons per day of fuel grade coke at the garyville refinery, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications. in early 2009, we discontinued production and sales of petroleum pitch and aliphatic solvents at our catlettsburg refinery. we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all seven of our refineries. another product of crude oil, heavy residual fuel oil, is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product. we have refinery based asphalt production capacity of up to 108 mbpd. we market asphalt through 33 owned or leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. we have a broad customer base, including approximately 675 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. we sell asphalt in the wholesale and cargo markets via rail and barge. we also produce asphalt cements, polymer modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts. in 2007, we acquired a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in clymers, indiana. we also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in greenville, ohio. the greenville plant began production in february 2008. both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner . 19 table of contents pipeline transportation we own a system of pipelines through marathon pipe line llc ( mpl ) and ohio river pipe line llc ( orpl ), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the midwest and gulf coast regions to our refineries, our terminals and other pipeline systems. our mpl and orpl wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1,737 miles of crude oil lines and 1,825 miles of refined product lines comprising 32 systems located in 11 states. the mpl common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states, based on total barrels delivered. our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and federal energy regulatory commission regulations and guidelines, including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products. third parties generated 13 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines in 2009. our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years. pipeline barrels handled (thousands of barrels per day) 2009 2008 2007 crude oil trunk lines 1,279 1,405 1,451 refined products trunk lines 953 960 1,049 total 2,232 2,365 2,500 we also own 196 miles of private crude oil pipelines and 850 miles of private refined products pipelines, and we lease 217 miles of common carrier refined product pipelines. we have partial ownership interests in several pipeline companies that have approximately 780 miles of crude oil pipelines and 3,600 miles of refined products pipelines, including about 970 miles operated by mpl. in addition, mpl operates most of our private pipelines and 985 miles of crude oil and 160 miles of natural gas pipelines owned by our e&amp;p segment. our major refined product pipelines include the owned and operated cardinal products pipeline and the wabash pipeline. the cardinal products pipeline delivers refined products from kenova, west virginia, to columbus, ohio. the wabash pipeline system delivers product from robinson, illinois, to various terminals in the area of chicago, illinois. other significant refined product pipelines owned and operated by mpl extend from: robinson, illinois, to louisville, kentucky; garyville, louisiana, to zachary, louisiana; and texas city, texas, to pasadena, texas. in addition, as of december 31, 2009, we had interests in the following refined product pipelines: 65 percent undivided ownership interest in the louisville-lexington system, a petroleum products pipeline system extending from louisville to lexington, kentucky; 60 percent interest in muskegon pipeline llc, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from griffith, indiana, to north muskegon, michigan; 50 percent interest in centennial pipeline llc, which owns a refined products system connecting the gulf coast region with the midwest market; 17 percent interest in explorer pipeline company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the gulf coast to the midwest; and 6 percent interest in wolverine pipe line company, a refined products pipeline system extending from chicago, illinois, to toledo, ohio. our major owned and operated crude oil lines run from: patoka, illinois, to catlettsburg, kentucky; patoka, illinois, to robinson, illinois; patoka, illinois, to lima, ohio; lima, ohio to canton, ohio; samaria, michigan, to detroit, michigan; and st. james, louisiana, to garyville, louisiana. as of december 31, 2009, we had interests in the following crude oil pipelines: 51 percent interest in loop llc, the owner and operator of loop, which is the only u.s. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at clovelly, louisiana; 59 percent interest in locap llc, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting loop and the capline system; 20 table of contents 33 percent undivided joint interest in the capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana, to patoka, illinois; 26 percent undivided joint interest in the maumee pipeline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from lima, ohio, to samaria, michigan; and 17 percent interest in minnesota pipe line company, llc, which owns crude oil pipelines extending from clearbrook, minnesota, to cottage grove, minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our st. paul park, minnesota refinery. we plan to construct, by the year 2012, a new section of pipeline connecting with the existing crude line from samaria, michigan, to detroit, michigan. this new section will deliver additional supplies of canadian crude to our detroit refinery. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the construction of a new section of pipeline in michigan. some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by government or third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. retail marketing ssa, our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in enon, ohio, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the speedway &reg; and superamerica &reg; brands. diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. ssa retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. for eight consecutive quarters, ssa has been rated as the best convenience store chain in terms of overall customer satisfaction in a national consumer perception survey conducted by corporate research international &reg; . in 2009, harris interactive equitrend &reg; annual brand equity study named speedway &reg; the number one gasoline brand with consumers. ssa speedy rewards , an industry-leading customer loyalty program, has built active membership to 3.2 million customers. as of december 31, 2009, ssa had 1,603 retail outlets in nine states. sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2009 and provide us with a base of ratable sales. revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $3,109 million in 2009, $2,838 million in 2008 and $2,796 million in 2007. the demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of ssa markets, with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season. margins from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based upon statistics compiled in the 2009 global upstream performance review published by ihs herold inc., we rank eighth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2008 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. there are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. based upon the the oil &amp; gas journal 21 table of contents 2010 worldwide refinery survey , we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2009. we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. we believe we compete with about 64 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; ten refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded jobbers and dealers; and approximately 290 retailers in the retail sale of refined products. (a jobber is a business that does not carry out refining operations but supplies refiner-branded products to gasoline stations or convenience stores. dealers refer to retail service station or convenience store operators affiliated with a brand identity.) we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. several nontraditional fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry and the national petroleum news estimates such retailers had 11 percent of the u.s. gasoline market in 2009. our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. environmental matters the public policy committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. state, national and international legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are being proposed and, in some cases, promulgated. this legislation applies or could apply in countries in which we operate. potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters. new laws are being enacted, and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial 22 table of contents condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air the epa is in the process of implementing regulations to address the national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. in connection with these standards, the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. to address these nonattainment areas, the epa proposed a rule in 2004 called the interstate air quality rule ( iaqr ) that would require significant emissions reductions in numerous states. the final rule, promulgated in 2005, was renamed the clean air interstate rule ( cair ). while the epa expects that states will meet their cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units, states were to have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. significant uncertainty in the final requirements of this rule resulted from litigation (state of north carolina, et al. v. epa). in july 2008, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the cair in its entirety and remanded it to epa to promulgate a rule consistent with the court opinion. in december 2008, the court modified its july ruling to leave the cair in effect until epa develops a new rule and control program. the epa has announced that it plans to propose a new clean air transport rule in july of 2010. it is expected that the cair will be significantly altered, and it could result in changes in emissions control strategies. our refinery operations are located in affected states, and some of these states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements on our refineries in order to meet the cair. we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the epa has issued a revised rule and states have taken further action to implement that rule. the epa is reviewing and is proposing to revise, all naaqs for criteria air pollutants. the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march 2008, and commenced the multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act. on september 16, 2009, the epa announced that they would reconsider the level of the ozone standard. by court order a final rule is to be signed by august 31, 2010. also, on july 15, 2009, the epa proposed a new short-term nitrogen dioxide standard. the final standard was issued january 22, 2010. in addition, on december 8, 2009, the epa proposed a new short term standard for sulfur dioxide. this final standard is to be issued no later than june 2, 2010. we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these revised naaqs standard until the implementing rules are established and judicial challenges over the revised naaqs standards are resolved. water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of any such release, opa-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. opa-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90, and we have established spill prevention, control and countermeasures ( spcc ) plans for facilities subject to cwa spcc requirements. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) 23 table of contents containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm&amp;t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. in 2010, canada will implement a ban on the land application of certain wastes. however, the ongoing waste handling and disposal-related costs associated with the canadian land disposal restrictions are not material because we have identified alternative hazardous waste treatment options within the united states. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. see item 3. legal proceedings environmental proceedings other proceedings for a discussion of these sites. the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its on going reclamation work. the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies. in february 2009, the alberta energy resources conservation board ( ercb ) issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. in september 2009, the aosp joint venture operator submitted a tailings management paper to the ercb, that sets forth its plan to comply with the directive. this plan is currently under review by the ercb. increased compliance costs may result if tailing pond reclamation technologies prove unsuccessful or less effective than anticipated. other matters in 2007, the u.s. congress passed the energy independence and security act ( eisa ), which, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020, and contains a second renewable fuel standard ( rfs2 ). the epa announced the final rfs2 regulations on february 4, 2010. the rfs2 requires 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuel usage in 2010, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. in the near term, the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. the rfs2 presents production and logistic challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries. the rfs2 has required, and will likely in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use. within the overall 36.0 billion gallon rfs2, eisa establishes an advanced biofuel rfs2 that begins with 0.95 billion gallons in 2010 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs2 include 1.15 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2010, increasing to 1.0 billion gallons in 2012, and 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel in 2010, increasing to 16.0 billion gallons by 2022. the epa has determined that 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel will not be produced in 2010 and has lowered the requirement to 5.0 million gallons. the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations. we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels. the usx separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the usx separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. 24 table of contents as a result of the usx separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. in connection with the usx separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the usx separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the usx separation. the following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the usx separation, united states steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. the financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. while no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, we have exposures to united states steel arising from the transaction discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. 25 table of contents employees we had 28,855 active employees as of december 31, 2009. of that number, 18,325 were employees of ssa, most of who were employed at our retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2012. certain employees at our texas city refinery are represented by the same union under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2012. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on may 31, 2012 at our st. paul park refinery and january 31, 2011, at our detroit refinery. executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon and their ages

filings. item 1a. risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, or in refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products; utilization rates of refineries; natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain. lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. 27 table of contents estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. the proved reserve information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group or third-party consultants. the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were priced at the average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2009, as well as other conditions in existence at the date. any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (bitumen is mined then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs, and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2009, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct 28 table of contents successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce our refining, marketing and transportation profitability and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall refining, marketing and transportation profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources, and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in the united states, canada and european union. these include proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. these actions could result in increased costs to (1) costs to operate and maintain our facilities, (2) capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our refineries and other facilities, and (3) costs to administer and manage any 29 table of contents potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. state, national and international legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are being proposed and, in some cases, promulgated. this legislation applies or could apply in countries in which we operate. our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases. likewise, emissions arise from our rm&amp;t operations, including the refining of crude oil, and from the use of our refined petroleum products by our customers. legislation or regulatory activity that impacts or could impact our operations includes: epa issued a finding that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. related to the endangerment finding, in september of 2009, the epa proposed a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and other light duty vehicles). this standard is expected to be finalized in the spring of 2010. the endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard are expected to lead to widespread regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and in october of 2009 the epa proposed a so-called tailoring rule to limit the applicability of the epa major permitting programs to larger sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as our refineries and a few large production facilities. in the u.s., the house of representatives and the senate each have their own form of cap and trade legislation to reduce carbon emissions (waxman-markey bill and the kerry-boxer bill). among other actions, cap and trade systems require businesses that emit greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process. although not ratified in the united states, the kyoto protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. the copenhagen accord was reached in december 2009 with the united states pledging to reduce emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. the canadian federal government has not enacted greenhouse gas emission reduction legislation although it has announced a commitment to reduce the country emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, to be pursued through a cap and trade system. the european union ( eu ) emissions trading scheme is in its second phase which runs from 2008 to 2012, in which eu member governments provide a certain number of free allowances to facilities and a facility may purchase additional eu allowances from other facilities, traders and the government. through 2009, we have complied with this program by using the allocated free allowances or by borrowing on our future year allowances. the canadian federal government and province of alberta jointly announced their intent to partially fund the aosp quest carbon capture and storage ( quest ccs ) project. under the terms of their letters of intent, alberta would contribute 745 million canadian dollars and the government of canada would provide 120 million canadian dollars toward the project development. the quest project would store approximately 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide annually and should allow the aosp to meet canadian and alberta emission reduction requirements for the foreseeable future. a final investment decision on the quest ccs project will be made at a later date, and is subject to regulatory approvals, stakeholder engagement, detailed engineering studies, as well as the agreement of joint venture partners. the state of california enacted legislation effective in 2007 capping california greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020 and directed its responsible state agency to adopt mandatory reporting rules for significant sources of greenhouse gases. we have not conducted significant business in california in recent years, but other states where we have operations could adopt similar greenhouse gas legislation. although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products) associated with any legislation, regulation, the epa or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. private party litigation has also been brought against emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but we have not been named in those cases. 30 table of contents our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. for example, we have been, and presently are, a defendant in various litigation and other proceedings involving products liability and other claims related to alleged contamination of groundwater with the oxygenate methyl tertiary-butyl ether ( mtbe ). we may become involved in further litigation or other proceedings, or we may be held responsible in existing or future litigation or proceedings, the costs of which could be material. we have in the past operated retail marketing sites with underground storage tanks ( usts ) in various jurisdictions and are currently operating retail marketing sites that have usts in numerous states. federal and state regulations and legislation govern the usts, and compliance with those requirements can be costly. the operation of usts also poses certain other risks, including damages associated with soil and groundwater contamination. leaks from usts which may occur at one or more of our retail marketing sites, or which may have occurred at our previously operated retail marketing sites, may impact soil or groundwater and could result in fines or civil liability for us. environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and /or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. this could affect our operational performance, financial position and reputation. uncertainty in the financial markets may impact our ability to obtain future financing and could adversely affect entities with which we do business. in the future we may require financing to grow our business. financial institutions participate in our revolving credit facility and provide us with services including insurance, cash management, commercial letters of 31 table of contents credit, derivative instruments, and short-term investments. uncertainty affecting the financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go bankrupt has altered levels of activity in the financial markets. a deterioration of the financial market conditions could significantly increase our costs associated with borrowing. our liquidity and our ability to access the credit and/or capital markets may also be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. in addition, there could be a number of follow-on effects from continued turmoil on us, including insolvency of customers, key suppliers, partners, and other counterparties. worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 29 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2009 was derived from production outside the united states and 71 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2009, were located outside the united states. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. in addition, a significant portion of the feedstock requirements for our refineries is satisfied through supplies originating in saudi arabia, kuwait, canada, mexico and various other foreign countries. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. there are many risks associated with operations in global markets, including changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen, synthetic crude oil or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. these risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the united states and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, severe weather and labor disputes. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport crude oil and refined products to, from and among facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. 32 table of contents our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision, acts of piracy and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of the interest in mpc, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland, a court could review our 2005 transactions with ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland as a result of those transactions. in connection with our transactions with ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of marathon common stock having a value of $915 million) to ashland shareholders. we obtained opinions from a nationally recognized appraisal firm that ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions and that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. although we are confident in our conclusions regarding ashland receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and its solvency both before and after giving effect to the closing of our transactions, such determinations involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. there has been a trend in recent years of litigation by attorneys general and other government officials seeking to recover civil damages from companies. we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. 33 table of contents we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.

holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the usx separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the usx separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001, and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. on june 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc ( map ) previously held by ashland inc. ( ashland ). in addition, we acquired a portion of ashland valvoline instant oil change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in loop llc which owns and operates the only u.s. deepwater oil port, and its interest in locap llc which owns a crude oil pipeline. as a result of the transactions, map is wholly owned by marathon and its name was changed to marathon petroleum company llc ( mpc ) effective september 1, 2005. on october 18, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of western oil sands inc. ( western ). western primary asset was a 20 percent interest in the outside-operated athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of alberta, canada. the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include western results from october 18, 2007. western oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate oil sands mining 1 table of contents segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the exploration and production segment. segment and geographic information our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil; 3) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis; and 4) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, transports and markets crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, upper great plains, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. the e&amp;p, osm and ig segments comprise our upstream operations. the rm&amp;t segment comprises our downstream operations. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. at the end of 2009, we were conducting oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in eight countries: the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, indonesia, libya, norway and the united kingdom. during 2009, we exited gabon and ireland. we plan to begin exploration activities in poland during 2010. our 2009 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 243 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2009 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 941 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2009 worldwide net sales averaged 400 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe. these volumes exclude 7 mboepd related to discontinued operations. in the united states during 2009, we drilled 76 gross (50 net) exploratory wells of which 72 gross (48 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 72 wells, 6 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 9 gross (1 net) exploratory wells of which 6 gross (1 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. all 6 wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2009. north america united states our u.s. operations accounted for 26 percent of our 2009 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 40 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. offshore the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area. during 2009, our net sales in the gulf of mexico averaged 24 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 20 mmcfd of natural gas. at year end 2009, we held interests in seven producing fields and four platforms in the gulf of mexico, of which we operate one platform. we operate the ewing bank 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the lobster, oyster and arnold fields. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. we own a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. an additional development well was successfully completed in 2009. the petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. 2 table of contents the neptune development commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in july 2008. we hold a 30 percent working interest in this outside-operated development located on atwater valley 575, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the completed phase i development included six subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. phase ii development activities have begun and the first well in this program was successfully drilled and completed in late 2009. development of the droshky discovery, located on green canyon block 244, continued in 2009. droshky phase i is a four well liquid hydrocarbon development with first production targeted for mid-year 2010. ongoing development activities include running intelligent well completions, installation of the subsea facilities and topside modifications to the third-party bullwinkle host platform. expected net peak production is approximately 50 mboepd. we hold a 100 percent operated working interest in droshky. development of the ozona prospect, located on garden banks block 515, has also continued. we have secured a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby third-party auger platform. first production is expected in 2011. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. in 2008, we drilled a successful liquid hydrocarbon appraisal well on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508. we hold a 25 percent interest in the outside-operated stones prospect. in the third quarter of 2008, we announced deepwater liquid hydrocarbon discovery on the gunflint prospect located on mississippi canyon block 948. we own a 13 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater liquid hydrocarbon discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 20 percent interest in the outside-operated prospect. in december 2009, we began drilling the flying dutchman well, on green canyon block 511, where we have 63 percent ownership and are the operator of this liquid hydrocarbon prospect. in addition to the prospects listed above, we held interests in 103 blocks in the gulf of mexico at the end of 2009, including 97 in the deepwater area. our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in 2010 and 2011. onshore we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. we have operated and outside-operated interests in 10 fields and hold a 51 to 100 percent working interest in each. in 2009, our net natural gas sales from alaska averaged 87 mmcfd. typically, our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. in 2009, we drilled six wells in alaska and plan to drill four to six wells per year during 2010 through 2012. we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. our plans include drilling approximately 65 wells over the next five years. we currently have one operated drilling rig running and averaged net sales of 15 mmcfd in 2009. we hold 336,000 acres over the bakken shale oil play in the williston basin of north dakota with a working interest of approximately 84 percent. approximately 225 locations will be drilled over the next four to five years. we are evaluating other potential horizons above and below the middle bakken. we currently have four operated drilling rigs running in our bakken program. we exited 2009 with average net sales of 11 mboepd in december. in 2008, we successfully completed our first horizontal well in the woodford shale natural gas play in the anadarko basin of oklahoma. we are currently participating in additional horizontal wells in the area where we hold 52,000 net acres. in 2009, we drilled 13 wells, five of which were operated. we plan to drill 10 to 15 wells in 2010. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas and north louisiana, with combined net sales of 121 mmcfd in 2009, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the permian basin of west texas, with net sales of 8 mbpd in 2009. in june 2009, we completed the sales of our operated and a portion of our outside-operated permian basin producing assets in new mexico and west texas. we still retain interests in 12 permian basin fields. we hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the u.s. in the appalachian basin we hold 70,000 net acres in the marcellus shale natural gas play in pennsylvania and west virginia. we drilled five wells 3 table of contents in 2009 and plan to drill another 8 to 12 wells in 2010. in louisiana and east texas, we hold 25,000 net acres in the haynesville shale natural gas play, where we drilled one well in 2009. we plan to drill three to four wells in 2010. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our wyoming fields averaged 18 mbpd and 113 mmcfd in 2009. we plan to drill 24 wells in 2010. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. the three potential in-situ developments are namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest, birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest, and ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest. initial test drilling on the birchwood prospect positively confirmed bitumen presence with additional test drilling required to confirm reservoir quality. africa equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field which is offshore equatorial guinea. during 2009, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 42 mbpd, or 17 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 426 mmcfd, or 45 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2009 included 30 mbpd of primary condensate. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price for the british thermal units used in the operations of the lpg plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and lpg. during 2009, a gross 943 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2009 included 4 mbpd of secondary condensate and 12 mbpd of lpg produced by alba plant llc. as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ), both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) production facility, both located on bioko island. dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. during 2009, a gross 115 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 647 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected back into the alba field for later production. we hold a 63 percent operated interest in the deep luba and gardenia discoveries on the alba block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the corona well on block d. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline. angola offshore angola, we hold 10 percent interests in block 31 and block 32, both of which are outside-operated. the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the psvm development. the psvm development will utilize a floating, production, storage and offloading ( fpso ) vessel. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned with the drilling of the first three to four development wells planned in 2010. first production is anticipated in late 2011 to early 2012. other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. eight of the block 32 discoveries form a potential development in the eastern area of that block. we expect first production on block 32 in 2015 or 2016. 4 table of contents libya we hold a 16 percent interest in the outside-operated waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2009 included the drilling of four wells. one well is waiting on completion, one was dry and abandoned, and two are currently drilling. we also drilled 5 development wells in libya during the year. net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya averaged 46 mbpd in 2009. the 2009 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in libya represented 19 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. net natural gas sales in libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2009. our faregh phase ii gas plant project is expected to deliver a gross 180 mmcfd of natural gas and 15 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons into the libyan domestic market. commissioning will begin in 2010, with startup planned for first quarter of 2011. europe norway norway is a growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed below. we were approved for our first operatorship on the offshore norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate eight licenses and hold interests in over 600,000 gross acres. the operated alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf commenced production in june 2008. the complex consists of an fpso with subsea infrastructure. improved reliability, combined with optimization work, increased the throughput of the fpso to 142 mbpd, up from the original design of 120 mbpd. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the existing u.k. scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system using a 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. first production to the complex was from the alvheim development which is comprised of the kameleon, east kameleon and kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. at the end of 2009, the alvheim development included ten producing wells and two water disposal wells. a phase 2 drilling program targeting three additional production wells, and a phase 2b drilling program with two additional production wells, is planned in 2010 through 2012. net sales for 2009 averaged 56 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 30 mmcfd of natural gas. the nearby outside-operated vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. during 2009, net liquid hydrocarbon sales from vilje averaged 12 mbpd. in june 2009, we completed the drilling program for the volund field as a subsea tieback to the alvheim complex. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated interest, is located approximately five miles south of the alvheim area and consists of one production well and one water disposal well. first production from volund was announced in september 2009. the volund owners have contracted for 25 gross mbpd (16 mbpd net) firm capacity on the alvheim fpso beginning in july 2010. until that date, volund will act as a swing producer, filling any available capacity and allowing the fpso to be fully utilized. also offshore norway, we and our partners announced the marihone and viper discoveries, both located within tie-back distance of the alvheim fpso. the marihone oil discovery is located in license pl340 about 12 miles south of the volund and alvheim fields. we hold a 65 percent operated working interest in marihone. the viper oil discovery is located immediately next to volund field in pl203, about 12 miles south of the alvheim fpso. we are the operator and hold a 65 percent interest in viper. conceptual development studies for both discoveries have begun. in addition, we hold a 28 percent interest in the outside-operated gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of norway. in january 2009, the operator announced a development concept that includes a fixed processing platform with seven production wells that would be tied to existing facilities on the sleipner field, and one water disposal well. united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. a two well development program is scheduled in 2010 for west brae. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. the east brae platform hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the brae area 5 table of contents averaged 11 mbpd in 2009. net brae natural gas sales averaged 101 mmcfd, or 11 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes, in 2009. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. in the u.k. atlantic margin west of the shetland islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. net sales from the foinaven fields averaged 13 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 7 mmcfd of natural gas in 2009. we are upgrading the fpso which will extend the life of this project through 2021. we have a 45 percent interest in five exploratory u.k. onshore coal seam gas licenses. drilling has been completed in five exploration wells in three of the licenses. we also hold a 55 percent operated working interest in 11 blocks awarded in a 2008 bid round. our interest covers 520,000 gross acres. poland we have recently added a new opportunity to our portfolio, poland shale gas. in november we were awarded the 296,000 acre kwidzyn block, followed by the 249,000 acre orzechow block in december. the five and a half year exploration phase for each block includes 2d seismic and at least one well. we were awarded the 269,000 acre brodnica block in january 2010, and we continue to look for additional opportunities in poland. we hold a 100 percent interest and operatorship in all three blocks. other international indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block offshore indonesia. the block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of sulawesi in the makassar strait, directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3d seismic acquisition in may 2008. a mandatory 25 percent relinquishment was submitted to the indonesian government in september 2009 and upon approval, the block size will be reduced from 1.2 million gross acres to 872,400 gross acres. we expect to drill two wells in 2010. in october 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the bone bay block offshore sulawesi. an increase in ownership to 55 percent is pending indonesian government approval. the bone bay block covers an area of 1.23 million acres and is 200 miles southeast of our pasangkayu block. current exploration plans for bone bay call for the acquisition of seismic data starting in 2010, followed by drilling of one exploration well in 2011. in the second quarter of 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the kumawa block, our third indonesia offshore exploration block, located offshore west papua. an increase in ownership to 55 percent is pending indonesian government approval. the kumawa block encompasses 1.24 million acres. a 2d seismic survey is planned in the first quarter of 2010 and we expect to drill one exploration well in 2011-2012. we are the operator of a drilling rig consortium, with five other operators, that has secured a deepwater exploration drilling rig to drill exploratory wells in indonesia over a two-year period commencing in the second quarter of 2010. the participants have the right to extend this rig contract for up to one additional year. we continue to participate in joint study agreements in indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. we completed two joint study agreements in 2008 and have one in progress. divestitures angola in february 2010, we closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent interest in the outside-operated production sharing contract and joint operating agreement on block 32 offshore angola for $1.3 billion, excluding any purchase price adjustments, with an effective date of january 1, 2009. we retained a 10 percent interest in block 32. 6 table of contents gabon in december 2009, we closed the sale of our operated properties in gabon. net production from these operations averaged 6 mbpd in 2009. the results of our gabonese operations have been reported as discontinued operations. united states in june 2009, we completed the sale of our operated and a portion of our outside-operated permian basin producing assets in new mexico and west texas for net proceeds after closing adjustments of $293 million. a $196 million pretax gain on the sale was recorded. net production from these sold properties averaged 8,150 boepd in the first quarter of 2009. ireland in april 2009, we closed the sale of our operated properties offshore ireland, which consisted of our 100 percent working interest in the kinsale head, ballycotton and southwest kinsale natural gas fields and our 87 percent working interest in the seven heads natural gas field. net production from these operations averaged 5 mboepd in the first quarter of 2009. in july 2009 we closed the sale of our subsidiary holding our 19 percent interest in the outside-operated corrib natural gas development offshore ireland. as a result of these dispositions, our irish exploration and production businesses have been reported as discontinued operations. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the timing of production from the droshky and ozona developments in the gulf of mexico, the faregh phase ii gas plant, the psvm development on block 31 offshore angola and block 32 and other possible developments. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 7 table of contents productive and drilling wells for our e&amp;p segment, the following tables set forth productive wells and service wells as of december 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and

our acquisition of western in 2007, we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. the aosp mining and extractions assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta and include the muskeg river mine which began bitumen production in 2003 and the jackpine mine which is currently under construction and anticipated to commence bitumen production in the second half of 2010. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. the upgrading assets are located at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. additional upgrading capacity is being constructed with an anticipated startup in late 2010 or early 2011. 9 table of contents in the second quarter of 2009, the operator of aosp offered three additional leases to the other joint venture partners for the muskeg river mine. terms of the transaction were as agreed in the original 1999 aosp joint venture agreement. we elected to participate in these leases and our net proved bitumen reserves increased 168 million barrels. see item 1. business reserves for comprehensive discussion of reserves related to our oil sands mining and conventional exploration and production operations. as of december 31, 2009, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross (45,000 net) acres. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile corridor pipeline. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the three major products that the scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil, heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. net synthetic crude oil sales were 32 mbpd in both 2009 and 2008, but were 4 mbpd in 2007. daily volumes for 2007 represent total volumes since the acquisition date over total days in the period. prior to our acquisition of western, the first fully integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved in 2006. expansion 1, which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine, addition of a new processing train at the scotford upgrading facility and development of related infrastructure, is on track and anticipated to begin mining operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010 or early 2011. when expansion 1 is complete, we will have more than 50 mbpd of production and upgrading capacity in the canadian oil sands. the timing and scope of potential future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review. the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of aosp expansion 1 and the timing of production. factors which could affect the expansion project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. the aosp expansion could be further affected by commissioning and start-up risks associated with prototype equipment and new technology. reserves in december 2008, the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) announced revisions to its regulations on oil and gas reporting. in january 2010, the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update which was intended to harmonize the accounting literature with the sec new regulations. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk). ig segment income decreased $212 million, or 70 percent, from 2008 to 2009. the decrease in income was primarily the result of lower realizations for lng and methanol. as evidenced by higher sales volumes, strong operational reliability at the eg lng facility throughout 2009 partially offset the impact of lower prices. the lng production facility averaged higher than 95 percent operational availability during 2009. we hold a 60 percent interest in the facility. 47 table of contents rm&amp;t segment income decreased $715 million, or 61 percent, from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of the decrease in our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon from 11.66 cents in 2008 to 6.10 cents in 2009. the gross margin decline is a result of a 52 percent narrowing of the sweet/sour differential, thereby increasing the relative cost of crude processed by our refineries. the narrowing of the sweet/sour differential resulted from a variety of worldwide economic and petroleum industry related factors primarily related to lower hydrocarbon demand. included in the refining and wholesale marketing gross margins were pretax derivative losses of $83 million in 2009 and $87 million in 2008. for a more complete explanation of our strategies to manage market risk related to commodity prices, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. we averaged 957 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2009 and 944 mbpd in 2008. total refinery throughputs averaged 1,153 mbpd in 2009 compared to 1,151 mbpd in 2008. crude and total throughputs were lower in 2008 than in 2009 in part due to the impact that hurricanes and other weather related events had on our operations in 2008. the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the rm&amp;t segment for 2009 and 2008. rm&amp;t operating statistics 2009 2008 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.0610 $ 0.1166 refined products

(b) our businesses in ireland and gabon were sold in 2009. all periods have been recast to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. (c) includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 32 mmcfd and 47 mmcfd in 2008 and 2007. (d) excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments and the unrealized effects of u.k. natural gas contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. e&amp;p segment revenues included derivative gains of $22 million in 2008 and losses of $15 million in 2007. excluded from e&amp;p segment revenues were gains of $218 million in 2008 and losses of $232 million in 2007 related to natural gas sales contracts in the u.k. that were accounted for as derivative instruments. osm segment revenues increased $901 million from 2007 to 2008, reflecting a full year of operations in 2008. revenues were impacted by net gains in 2008 and net losses in 2007 on derivative instruments, which expire 49 table of contents december 2009, that were held by western at the acquisition date and intended to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude oil. the 2008 net gain of $48 million included realized losses of $72 million and unrealized gains of $120 million, while less than $1 million of the $53 million net loss in 2007 was realized. additionally, revenues were negatively impacted by reliability issues and the implementation of a revised tailings management plan that impacted ore grade. sales of synthetic crude oil averaged 32 mbpd at an average realized price of $91.90 per barrel compared to a $71.07 average realized price for the period from the october 18, 2007, acquisition date through december of 2007. rm&amp;t segment revenues increased $8,406 million from 2007 to 2008. higher refined product selling prices were realized in 2008, but lower sales volumes partially offset the price impact. income from equity method investments increased $220 million from 2007 to 2008. the equatorial guinea lng production facility operated for the full year of 2008, accounting for most of the increased income, with 54 cargoes delivered in 2008 compared to 24 in 2007. in addition, there was an $81 million increase in ptc income due to higher retail margins. offsetting these increases was the $40 million pretax impairment of our equity investment in two ethanol production facilities, losses generated by one of those facilities and lower income from ampco. ampco sales volumes and realized prices were lower in 2008 due to temporary reductions in available feedstock gas and plant reliability problems. net gain on disposal of assets increased $387 million as a result of the review of our portfolio of assets that commenced in 2008. we sold our outside-operated interests (24 percent of heimdal field, 47 percent of vale field and 20 percent of skirne field) and associated undeveloped acreage in offshore norway and our share of the ptc joint venture in 2008. property sales in 2007, primarily related to sales of individual producing properties and retail outlets were not significant. cost of revenues increased $10,548 million from 2007 to 2008. the increases were primarily in the rm&amp;t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil. acquisition costs for refinery charge and blendstocks and for purchased refined products also increased, but the impact of this increase was partially offset by the impact of lower refinery throughput. depreciation, depletion and amortization ( dd&amp;a ) increased $565 million in 2008 from 2007. the increase in 2008 primarily relates to new assets. our oil sands assets operated for the full year of 2008 and two significant offshore developments, alvheim/vilje offshore norway and neptune in the gulf of mexico, began operating at mid-year. goodwill impairment expense of $1,412 million relates to our osm reporting unit. during the fourth quarter of 2008, we tested our osm reporting unit goodwill for impairment and upon allocating fair value among the reporting unit assets, there was no remaining implied fair value of goodwill as of december 31, 2008. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the impairment. net interest and other financial income or costs reflected $28 million in costs for 2008 and $33 million of income for 2007. interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and average cash balances during 2008. while interest expense also increased due to a higher level of short-term commercial paper borrowings throughout 2008 a similar increase in capitalized interest related to our capital projects offset the impact. gain on foreign currency derivative instruments in 2007 represented gains on foreign currency derivative instruments entered to limit our exposure to changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate related to the cash portion of the purchase price for western. these derivative instruments were settled on october 17, 2007. provision for income taxes increased $565 million from 2007 to 2008, a 20 percent increase, although income from continuing operations before income taxes increased only $183 million, or 3 percent. the effective tax rate in 2008 was impacted by the goodwill impairment which cannot be deducted for purposes of calculating income tax. the consolidated effective tax rate was also influenced by the geographical mix of income and related tax expense. partially offsetting the effective tax rate increase caused by the goodwill impairment and income mix were benefits related to the reversal of the valuation allowance on the norwegian net operating loss carryforwards and a $249 million benefit from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated deferred tax balances. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. discontinued operations reflect the current year disposal of our e&amp;p businesses in ireland and gabon (see note 7) and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for all periods presented. 50 table of contents segment results: 2008 compared to 2007 segment income for 2008 and 2007 is summarized and reconciled to net income in the following table.

(b) amounts relate to natural gas contracts in the u. k. that are accounted for as derivative instruments and recorded at fair value. united states e&amp;p income increased $246 million, or 39 percent, from 2007 to 2008. the majority of the increase from year to year was due to overall higher average liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realizations with relatively flat sales volumes. partially offsetting the benefits of higher prices were increases in production taxes, operating expenses, dd&amp;a and income taxes. exploration expenses were $238 million for 2008, lower than $274 million in 2007. international e&amp;p income increased $758 million, or 82 percent, from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to higher average liquid hydrocarbon realizations and higher sales volumes for both liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. natural gas realizations were slightly lower because a significant portion of the natural gas sales volume increase related to that sold in equatorial guinea to the lng production facility at a fixed price. operating expenses and dd&amp;a, associated with production from new developments, and income taxes also increased during 2008. osm segment income reported income of $258 million in 2008 as compared to a loss of $63 million in 2007. an after-tax gain on crude oil derivative instruments of $32 million was included in 2008 income while an after-tax loss of $40 million was recorded in 2007 (see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk). results for 2008 include a full year of operations in comparison to two and one-half months of operation in 2007. bitumen was produced at an average rate of 25 mbpd in 2008. production and processing levels were adversely impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance, reliability issues and the implementation of a revised tailings management plan that impacted ore grade, which also increased operating costs. ig segment income increased $170 million, or 129 percent, in 2008 from 2007. the increase in income was primarily related to a full year of operation of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea, which commenced operations in may 2007. we hold a 60 percent interest in the facility. segment expenses increased slightly in 2008 as we continue to develop new technologies. in 2008, we spent $92 million on gas commercialization technologies, including completing construction of a gas-to-fuels demonstration plant. such expense in 2007 was $42 million. rm&amp;t segment income decreased $898 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily a result of a decrease in our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon from 18.48 cents in 2007 to 11.66 cents in 2008. the 51 table of contents refining and wholesale marketing gross margin decline was consistent with the market indicators (crack spreads) in the midwest and gulf coast regions. in addition, manufacturing expenses were higher in 2008 due primarily to higher energy costs and maintenance activities. included in the refining and wholesale marketing gross margins were pretax derivative losses of $87 million in 2008 and $899 million in 2007. the variance primarily reflects falling crude futures prices in the second half of 2008, as well as the fact that we reduced our use of derivatives to manage domestic crude oil acquisition price risk. for a more complete explanation of our strategies to manage market risk related to commodity prices, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. we averaged 944 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2008 and 1,010 mbpd in 2007. total refinery throughputs averaged 1,151 mbpd in 2008 compared to 1,224 mbpd in 2007. crude and total throughputs were lower in 2008 than in 2007 in part due to the impact hurricanes and other weather related events had on our operations in 2008. the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the rm&amp;t segment for 2008 and 2007. rm&amp;t operating statistics 2008 2007 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1166 $ 0.1848 refined products sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) 1,352 1,410 (a) sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity cash flows net cash provided from operating activities totaled $5,268 million in 2009 compared to $6,752 million in 2008 and $5,900 million in 2007. the $1,484 million decrease in 2009 reflects the impact of lower average realized prices in 2009. the $852 million increase in 2008 primarily reflects the impact of higher average realized prices in 2008. net cash used in investing activities totaled $5,238 million in 2009, compared with $5,405 million in 2008 and $7,481 million in 2007. significant investing activities include additions to property, plant and equipment, asset disposals and an acquisition of a business in 2007. the most significant additions to property, plant and equipment relate to our long-term projects, which cross several years. in our e&amp;p segment, exploration and development projects in angola impacted all three years. development and completion of the alvheim/vilje project affected 2007 and 2008, with other developments in the area in 2009. beginning in 2008, spending on u.s. exploration and development projects in the gulf of mexico and unconventional resource plays became a more significant portion of our additions to property, plant and equipment. in the osm segment, the aosp expansion 1 began in 2008 and continued through 2009. in our rm&amp;t segment, the expansion of our garyville, louisiana, refinery affected all years. also in rm&amp;t, the expansion and upgrading of our detroit, michigan refinery commenced with front-end engineering and design work in 2007 and construction in 2008 and 2009. we have revised prior year amounts of capital expenditures in the consolidated statement of cash flows. the consolidated statements of cash flows excludes changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. a reconciliation of this amount to the reported capital expenditures follows for all years presented: (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 additions to property, plant and equipment $ 6,231 $ 6,989 $ 3,757 change in capital accruals (343 ) 30 621 discontinued operations 84 127 88 capital expenditures $ 5,972 $ 7,146 $ 4,466 acquisitions in 2007 consist of the $3,907 million cash portion of the western acquisition purchase price, net of the $44 million of cash acquired. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the western acquisition. 52 table of contents disposal of assets totaled $865 million, $999 million and $137 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007. in 2009, we sold all of our operated and outside-operated interests in ireland and gabon, reporting the disposals as discontinued operations. we also sold our operated and a portion of our outside-operated permian basin producing assets in new mexico and west texas. in 2008, disposal of assets included proceeds from the sale of our outside-operated interests and related undeveloped acreage in norway and our share of ptc. in 2007, we sold our interests in two lng tankers in alaska. disposals for all years included proceeds from the sale of various domestic producing properties and ssa stores. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about dispositions. net cash provided from financing activities totaled $724 million in 2009, compared with cash used in financing activities of $1,193 million in 2008 and cash provided from financing activities of $184 million in 2007. sources of cash included the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes in 2009, the issuance of $1.0 billion in senior notes in 2008 and the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes and borrowings of $578 million from the norwegian export credit agency in 2007. repayments of debt and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plan were significant uses of cash in 2008 and 2007, while dividend payments impacted every year. significant noncash transactions during 2007 included the issuance of $1.0 billion of 5.125 percent fixed rate revenue bonds (marathon oil corporation project) series 2007a, with a maturity date of june 1, 2037. the proceeds from the bonds, along with interest income, were held in trust and were disbursed to us for reimbursement of expenditures related to our garyville, louisiana refinery expansion over the course of the construction project. until all trusteed funds were disbursed, the balance was reported as other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. as of december 31, 2009, we have received all funds from this financing. liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, and our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility. because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, share repurchase program, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. capital resources credit arrangements and borrowings at december 31, 2009, we had $8,436 million in long term debt outstanding. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by standard and poor corporation, moody investor services, inc. and fitch ratings with ratings of bbb+, baa1, and bbb+, all with stable outlook. should one or all of these agencies decide to downgrade our ratings, it could become more difficult and more costly for us to issue new debt or commercial paper. we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. at december 31, 2009, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no

statement with the securities and exchange commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. 53 table of contents cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 23 percent and 22 percent

the issuance of the $1.0 billion of revenue bonds by the parish of st. john the baptist, the proceeds were trusteed and were disbursed to us upon our request for reimbursement of expenditures related to the garyville refinery expansion. the trusteed funds were reflected as other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2008. capital requirements capital spending we have approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $5,148 million for 2010, which represents a 17 percent decrease from our 2009 spending. additional details related to the 2010 budget are discussed in outlook. other expected cash outflows we plan to make contributions of up to $17 million to fund pension plans during 2010. as of december 31, 2009, $96 million of our long-term debt is due in the next twelve months. dividends of $0.96 per common share or $679 million were paid during 2009. on february 1, 2010, we announced that our board of directors had declared a dividend of $0.24 cents per share on marathon common stock, payable march 10, 2010, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 17, 2010. share repurchase program since january 2006, our board of directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. as of december 31, 2009, we had repurchased 66 million common shares at a cost of $2,922 million. we have not made any purchases under the program since august 2008. purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. this program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. the program authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. the timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales and cash from available borrowings. our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this 54 table of contents information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. the discussion of liquidity above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital, investment and exploration spending and a review of our portfolio of assets. the forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading or refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. the forward-looking statements about our common share repurchase program are based on current

(b) we anticipate cash payments for interest of $500 million for 2010, $922 million for 2011-2012, $731 million for 2013-2014 and $3,474 million for the remaining years for a total of $5,627 million. of these, we anticipate cash payments for interest of $16 million for 2010, $22 million for 2011-2012, $16 million for 2013-2014 and $108 million for the later years to be made by united states steel. (c) the majority of these contractual obligations as of december 31, 2009 relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first 180 days of 2010. these contracts include variable price arrangements. (d) we have acquired the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the elba island lng re-gasification terminal. the agreement primary term ends in 2021. pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the terminal. (e) service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (f) we are a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with alliance pipeline. this agreement was used by alliance pipeline to secure its financing. this arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. (g) commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs. (h) primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. we have estimated projected funding requirements through 2019. also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions. (i) includes $362 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by united states steel. see item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel. (j) this table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,102 million. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. transactions with related parties we own a 63 percent working interest in the alba field offshore equatorial guinea. onshore equatorial guinea, we own a 52 percent interest in an lpg processing plant, a 60 percent interest in an lng production facility and a 45 percent interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. we sell our natural gas from the alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes. the methanol that is produced is then sold through another equity method investee. 56 table of contents sales of refined petroleum products to our 50 percent equity method investee, ptc, which was sold in october 2008, accounted for 2.5 percent or less of our total sales revenue for 2008 and 2007. we believe that these transactions with related parties have been conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees, united states steel and others. these arrangements are described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. obligations associated with the separation of united states steel we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the usx separation. united states steel obligations to us are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. if united states steel fails to satisfy these obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. as of december 31, 2009, we have identified the following obligations that have been assumed by united states steel: $286 million of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former united states steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2033. accrued interest payable on these bonds was $6 million at december 31, 2009. we anticipate united states steel will make future interest payments of $16 million for 2010, $22 million for 2011-2012, $16 million for 2013-2014 and $108 million for the later years. $29 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2009. $25 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel clairton coke-making facility, with a term extending to 2012. there was no accrued interest payable on this financing at december 31, 2009. $16 million of operating lease obligations, all of which was assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by united states steel. a guarantee with respect to all obligations of united states steel to the limited partners of the clairton 1314b partnership, l.p., which was terminated on october 31, 2008. upon termination of the partnership, we were not released from our obligations under guarantee. united states steel has reported that it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. of the total $362 million, obligations of $346 million and corresponding receivables from united states steel were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2009, (current portion $22 million; long-term portion $324 million). the remaining $16 million was related to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of united states steel. 57 table of contents in its form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2009, united states steel management stated that it believes its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. during 2009, united states steel undertook certain plans and actions designed to preserve and enhance its liquidity and financial flexibility, including the sale of its common stock and issuance of senior convertible notes due 2014 for net proceeds of approximately $1,496 million. during the fourth quarter of 2009, united states steel refinanced $129 million of certain debt for which we were liable; as a direct result of the refinancing, we are no longer liable for that $129 million. united states steel senior unsecured debt ratings are bb by standard and poor corporation, ba3 by moody investment service, inc. and bb+ by fitch ratings. the ratings listed reflect a fitch downgrade from bbb- to bb+ in january 2010. outlook our board of directors approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $5,148 million for 2010, which includes budgeted capital expenditures of $4,863 million. this represents a 17 percent decrease from 2009 spending. the focus of our 2010 budget is on exploration and production activities, with an emphasis on ongoing development projects, certain potentially significant exploration wells and growing our presence in unconventional resource plays. exploration and production the worldwide exploration and production budget for 2010 is $2,868 million, of which $1,023 million is designated for our global exploration drilling program. a primary focus in 2010 is the deepwater gulf of mexico, where we plan to drill three or four significant wells. we have also targeted spending for indonesia, where we plan to drill two potentially high-reward, but also high-risk, deepwater wells in 2010. additionally, we anticipate drilling or participating in approximately 20 to 30 wells in emerging north american resource plays the marcellus shale in pennsylvania/west virginia, the woodford shale in oklahoma and the haynesville/bossier play in texas and approximately 10 to 15 onshore conventional wells in the lower 48 in 2010. this year production budget of $1,845 million is concentrated on three key oil projects: north dakota bakken shale oil play, where we plan to drill or participate in approximately 75 wells; offshore norway, where we plan further drilling or development on satellite fields surrounding the alvheim/vilje development, such as the gudrun field; and offshore angola, where deepwater psvm development on block 31 is under way. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned at the psvm, with the first three to four development wells planned in 2010. first production is anticipated in late 2011 to early 2012. other discoveries on angola block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block and eight of the block 32 discoveries form another potential development in the eastern area of that block. we expect first production on block 32 in 2015-2016. additionally, in the gulf of mexico, we are winding down spending on the droshky development, in which we own a 100 percent working interest while continuing work on the ozona development. first production from droshky is targeted for mid-2010. initial production from ozona, where we hold a 68 percent working interest, is expected in late 2011. we also plan to drill or participate in approximately 100 conventional development wells onshore u.s. in 2010. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, investments in new resource plays and development projects, the timing of production from the droshky and ozona developments in the gulf of mexico, the faregh phase ii gas plant, the pvsm development on block 31 offshore angola, block 32 and other possible developments. some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals or permits. the offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. oil sands mining the budget includes $668 million for the oil sands mining segment in 2010, down 32 percent as aosp expansion 1 approaches completion. expansion 1, which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities 58 table of contents at the jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine, addition of a new processing train at the scotford upgrading facility and development of related infrastructure, is on track and anticipated to begin mining operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010 or early 2011. when expansion 1 is complete, we will have more than 50 mbpd of production and upgrading capacity in the canadian oil sands. the timing and scope of potential future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review. beginning late in the first quarter of 2010 and continuing into the second quarter, the existing aosp mine and upgrader operations will undergo a scheduled turnaround. the last scheduled turnaround occurred in 2006. production is planned to be curtailed for approximately 60 to 70 days, during which the facilities will be completely shutdown for approximately two-thirds of the time. we expect our net cost of the turnaround to be approximately $85 to $120 million. additional tie-ins and pipeline commissioning work related to the expansion 1 will occur during this period, but such costs are included in the expansion 1 capital budget. evaluation of the aosp quest carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) project continues in 2010. a final investment decision on the quest ccs project will be made at a later date, and is subject to regulatory approvals, stakeholder engagement, detailed engineering studies, as well as a final joint venture partner agreement. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated completion of the aosp expansion 1 and the planned turnaround at the aosp mine and upgrader. factors which could affect these projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. refining, marketing and transportation the 2010 budget includes $1,114 million for rm&amp;t segment projects. with the completion of the garyville refinery expansion in 2009, budgeted spending is almost half what it was for 2009. as the new units comprising the garyville refinery expansion reach full capacity utilization, we will have the capability to increase our relative distillate production capacity. continuation of the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project accounts for about 36 percent of the budget. the detroit project when finished will increase the refinery heavy oil upgrading capacity, including canadian bitumen blends, by about 80 mbpd, and will increase its total crude oil refining capacity by 10 percent. through the garyville and detroit refinery investments, we expect to more than double our coking capacity by 2012, which should lead to lower feedstock costs and increased margins. in early january 2010, we began an extended turnaround at the 256 mbpd base refinery in garyville (the new expansion refinery will be operating during the time of the turnaround at the base refinery). the entire facility (base plus expansion) is expected to reach full refining capacity of 436 mbpd by the second quarter of 2010. total expense from turnarounds and major maintenance activities is expected to increase by approximately $100 million pretax in the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter 2009, primarily due to the extent of the garyville turnaround and major maintenance activities. the remainder of the budget is allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements, notably the mobile source air toxics ( msat ii ) regulations that will be effective at the beginning of 2011. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, expected turnaround expenditures and msat ii regulations compliance costs. some factors that could affect the detroit and msat ii projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, other risks customarily associated with construction projects. these factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. integrated gas although we have not budgeted for any capital spending for our integrated gas segment in 2010, we will continue non-capital spending in pursuit of the development of new technologies to supply new energy sources. we are evaluating the commercialization of our gas-to-fuels ( gtf ) technology and are pursuing other technologies focused on reducing the processing and transportation costs of natural gas. 59 table of contents the above discussion contains forward looking statements with respect to the potential commercialization of our gtf technology. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. corporate and other the remaining $498 million of our 2010 budget relates to capitalized interest and corporate activities. the net income tax liabilities of our osm operations are denominated in canadian dollars and must be remeasured to u.s. dollars each reporting period. at year end we took steps, as permitted under canadian tax rules, which will enable us to convert these liabilities during the first half of 2010 to be denominated in u.s. dollars and thereby eliminate exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes on our net deferred tax liability related to osm operations from that point forward. the forward-looking statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. for additional information see item 1a. risk factors. our environmental expenditures (a) for each of the last three years were: (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 capital $ 399 $ 421 $ 199 compliance operating and maintenance 373 379 287 remediation (b) 29 26 25 total $ 801 $ 826 $ 511 (a) amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines regarding the definition of environmental expenditures. (b) these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. our environmental capital expenditures accounted for seven percent of capital expenditures for continuing operations in 2009, six percent in 2008 and four percent in 2007. 60 table of contents we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be $304 million, or six percent, of capital expenditures in 2010. predictions beyond 2010 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $331 million in 2011; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. of particular significance to our refining operations are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in diesel fuel for off-road use. we have spent approximately $175 million between 2006 and 2009 on refinery investments to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use, in compliance with epa regulations. further, we estimate that we may spend approximately $1 billion over a six-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with msat ii regulations relating to benzene content in refined products. we have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these requirements. our actual msat ii expenditures have totaled $283 million through december 31, 2009 and we expect to spend $325 million on msat ii in 2010. the cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in 2010. for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see item 1. business environmental matters, item 3. legal proceedings and item 1a. risk factors. critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. estimated net proved reserves we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves, both developed and undeveloped. the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing such properties for impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of net recoverable quantities of reserves. proved reserves are the those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and 61 table of contents under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that a renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. beginning december 31, 2009, reserve estimates are based upon an average of prices in the prior 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month. in previous periods, reserve estimates were based upon prices at december 31. neither of these prices should be expected to reflect future market conditions. during 2009, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 596 mmboe (50 percent of the beginning of the year reserve estimate), with 603 mmboe of the increase related to the presentation of reserves related to oil sand mining as synthetic crude oil effective december 31, 2009 under the sec revised regulations. the estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil is a highly technical process, which is based upon several underlying assumptions that are subject to change. for a discussion of our reserve estimation process, including the use of third-party audits, see item 1. business. depreciation and depletion of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil producing (including oil sands mining and upgrading assets) properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved developed reserves. the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has not been significant to either our e&amp;p or our osm segments. for our e&amp;p segment, on average, a five percent increase in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.53 per barrel, which would increase pretax income by approximately $78 million annually, based on 2009 production. conversely, on average, a five percent decrease in the amount of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.58 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $86 million annually, based on 2009 production. for our osm segment, on average, a five percent increase in estimated synthetic crude oil reserves would lower the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.66 per barrel and would result in an increase in pretax income of approximately $8 million annually, based on 2009 production. on average, a five percent decrease in estimated synthetic crude oil reserves would increase the depreciation and depletion rate by approximately $0.36 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately $4 million annually, based on 2009 production. fair value estimates effective january 1, 2008 and 2009, we adopted the new accounting standards for assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring and those recognized and disclosed on a nonrecurring basis. the standards define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. the standards do not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date, while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans. in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, we consider proved and weighted probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the releasing of an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies in the event the 64 table of contents forecasted conditions actually occurred. the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plans and our unfunded u.s. retiree health care plan due to the different projected liability durations of 8 years and 12 years. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary discount rate modeling tool. this tool applies a yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical aa yield curve. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual discount rates from 1.5 to 30 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. each issue is required to have at least $150 million par value outstanding. the top quartile bonds are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield curve. of the assumptions used to measure the december 31, 2009 obligations and estimated 2010 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. a 0.25 percent decrease in the discount rates of 5.50 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 5.95 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $129 million and $21 million and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $13 million and $2 million. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the u.s. funded pension plans and 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent debt securities for the international funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our long term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to our historical returns for reasonableness. a 0.25 percent decrease in the asset rate of return assumption would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. note 22 to the consolidated financial statements includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the balance sheets as of december 31, 2009, and 2008. contingent liabilities we accrue contingent liabilities for environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes, product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable. actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. for instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments of the amount of 65 table of contents damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. our in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized. we generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. an estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. accounting standards not yet adopted variable interest accounting standards were amended by the fasb in june 2009. the new accounting standards replace the existing quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity. in addition, the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities has been eliminated and therefore, will now be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance. ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity are also required. the amended variable interest accounting standard requires reconsideration for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lack the power from voting rights or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity. enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity. application will be prospective beginning in the first quarter of 2010, and for all interim and annual periods thereafter. earlier application is prohibited. adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. a standard to improve disclosures about fair value measurements was issued by the fasb in january 2010. the additional disclosures required include: (1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the significant inputs and techniques used to measure level 2 and level 3 assets and liabilities for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, (3) the gross presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for the rollforward of level 3 activity, and (4) the transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2. the new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2009, except for the gross presentation of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements for the rollforward of level 3 activity. those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2010, and for interim periods thereafter. 66 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, synthetic crude oil and refined product prices. we employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. we believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. see notes 16 and 17 to the consolidated financial statement for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income for those which qualify as hedges and those not designated as hedges. commodity price risk our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. however, management has the authority, within board-approved levels, to protect prices on forecasted sales, as deemed appropriate. we use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses. we also may utilize the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions. we regularly use commodity derivative instruments in the e&amp;p segment to manage natural gas price risk during the time that the natural gas is held in storage before it is sold or on natural gas that is purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production. we may act opportunistically to protect prices on forecasted sales of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas or synthetic crude oil in our e&amp;p or osm segments. in late december 2009 and early january 2010, we saw an opportunity to protect a portion of our 2010 forecasted sales against the risk of declining prices. our rm&amp;t segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments to manage price risk on crude oil and refined product inventories. we also use derivative instruments to manage price risk related to the acquisition of foreign-sourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products. in addition, we may use commodity derivative instruments to manage risk on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products. the majority of these derivatives are exchange-traded contracts for crude oil, natural gas, refined products, ethanol and natural gas measured at fair value with a market approach using the close-of-day settlement prices for the market making them a level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. open commodity derivative positions and sensitivity analysis at december 31, 2009, we held open derivative contracts in our e&amp;p segment to manage the price risk on natural gas held in storage or purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production. these hedges were in amounts in line with normal levels of activity. beginning in december 2009 and into january 2010, we entered swaps on a portion of our forecast 2010 sales of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil as follows: 40 percent of natural gas sales from the lower 48 states of the u.s. 80 percent of synthetic crude oil sales in canada, and 20 percent of liquid hydrocarbon sales in the u.s. and norway. we have not qualified these swaps for hedge accounting. as a result, we recognize in net income all changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in those operations. the majority of these derivatives are measured at fair value with a market approach using broker quotes or third-party pricing services, which have been 67 table of contents corroborated with data from active markets, making them a level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in the fair value accounting standards. the largest portion of open derivative contracts in our e&amp;p and osm segments are those related to 2010 forecasted sales, as listed on the table below: term bbls per day weighted average swap price

(in millions) fair value incremental change in fair value financial assets (liabilities) (a) receivable from united states steel $ 360 $ 2 (c) interest rate swap agreements $ 5 (b) $ 9 (c) long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ (8,754 ) (b) $ (348 ) (c) (a) fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. (b) fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. (c) for receivables from united states steel and long-term debt, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity of our receivables and long-term debt at december 31, 2009. for interest rate swap agreements, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the effective swap rate at december 31, 2009. at december 31, 2009, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. 69 table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward and option contracts. the primary objective of this program is to reduce our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates by locking in such rates. the following tables summarize our foreign currency derivative instruments as of december 31, 2009.

(1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the usx separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the usx separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001, and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. segment and geographic information our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and 1 table of contents index to financial statements market synthetic crude oil; 3) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis; and 4) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, transports and markets crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. the e&amp;p, osm and ig segments comprise our upstream operations. the rm&amp;t segment comprises our downstream operations. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. at the end of 2010, we were conducting oil and gas exploration, development or production activities in ten countries: the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, indonesia, libya, norway, poland, the iraqi kurdistan region, and the united kingdom. our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 245 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2010 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 878 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2010 worldwide net sales averaged 391 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe. in the united states during 2010, we drilled 77 gross (36 net) exploratory wells of which 73 gross (32 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 73 wells, 35 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 10 gross (2 net) exploratory wells of which 7 gross (1 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. all 7 wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2010. north america united states our u.s. operations accounted for 29 percent of our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 41 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. offshore the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area, with over 20 prospects. at year end 2010, we held material interests in seven producing fields, four of which are company operated. an eighth field is under development and anticipated to come on-line in 2011. gulf of mexico drilling moratorium on april 22, 2010, the deepwater horizon, a rig that was engaged in drilling operations in the deepwater gulf of mexico, sank after an explosion and fire. the incident resulted in a significant oil spill in the gulf of mexico. marathon had no involvement in the incident. as a result of the deepwater horizon incident, the u.s. department of the interior issued a drilling moratorium on may 30, 2010, to suspend the drilling of deepwater wells, and prohibit drilling any new deepwater wells (defined as greater than 500 foot water depth). shortly after the moratorium was issued, we temporarily suspended drilling an exploratory well on the innsbruck prospect, located on mississippi canyon block 993. although the drilling moratorium was lifted on october 12, 2010, it is not known when plans and permits will be approved for future deepwater drilling activity. we sent a revised development operations coordination document for the ozona completion and a revised exploration plan for the innsbruck well to the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement ( boemre ). we continue to update our revised oil spill response plan as new and updated requirements come from the boemre. we filed our first deepwater exploration plan since the deepwater horizon incident to the boemre on october 15, 2010. we are continuing to engage the boemre to provide them with all the requested information. the boemre has not yet deemed our plan submitted. the effects of new or additional laws or regulations that may be adopted in response to this incident are not fully known at this time and may impact future project execution. we operate the ewing bank 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the ewing bank 873 (lobster), ewing bank 917 (oyster) and ewing bank 963 (arnold) fields. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. 2 table of contents index to financial statements we own a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. the petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. the neptune development commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in july 2008. we hold a 30 percent working interest in this outside-operated development located on atwater valley 575, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the completed phase i development included six subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. phase ii development activities have begun and the first well in this program was successfully drilled and completed in late 2009. our droshky development in the gulf of mexico on green canyon block 244 began production in mid-july of 2010 and reached peak net production of 45,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2010. production declines have been steeper than anticipated due to reservoir compartmentalization and lack of aquifer support. this subsea project consists of four development wells tied back to a third-party platform. three of the four wells are currently producing. we plan to re-enter the fourth well in the first quarter of 2011. we hold a 100 percent operated working interest and an 81 percent net revenue interest in droshky. development of our operated ozona prospect, located on garden banks block 515, has also continued. we are in the process of securing a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby third-party auger platform. first production of liquid hydrocarbon is expected in 2011. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. in 2008, we drilled a successful oil appraisal well on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508. we hold a 25 percent interest in the outside-operated stones prospect. in the third quarter of 2008, we announced deepwater oil discovery on the gunflint prospect located on mississippi canyon block 948. we own a 13 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater oil discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 10 percent interest in the outside-operated prospect. in december 2009, we began drilling an exploratory well on the flying dutchman prospect, located on green canyon block 511 in the gulf of mexico. we have 63 percent ownership and are the operator of this liquid hydrocarbon prospect. the flying dutchman reached its targeted total depth in early may 2010. the well encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands that require further technical evaluation. the results of the flying dutchman well will continue to be evaluated to determine overall commerciality. in addition to the prospects listed above, we held interests in 103 blocks in the gulf of mexico at the end of 2010, including 97 in the deepwater area. our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in 2011 and 2012, presuming a favorable regulatory environment that will allow deep-water drilling to resume. onshore we hold 391,000 net acres in the bakken shale oil play in the williston basin of north dakota with a working interest of approximately 80 percent. approximately 275 company-operated locations will be drilled over the next 4 years. we are evaluating other potential horizons above and below the middle bakken. we currently have six operated drilling rigs running in our bakken shale program, and will add a rig solely dedicated to completion operations in the first quarter of 2011. in the anadarko woodford shale horizon, a liquids-rich play in oklahoma, we continue to expand our acreage position and now hold approximately 88,000 net acres within the play. we have existing production operations in this geographical area which will facilitate early drilling, with initial wells currently in progress. we plan to increase from three to eight company operated rigs in 2011. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas, and north louisiana with combined net gas sales of 103 mmcfd in 2010. in december 2010, we entered into an agreement with an operator in the eagle ford shale, a liquids-rich play in texas. we initially paid $10 million and will drill and complete four wells to earn approximately 17,000 net acres. we also have an option that expires october 31, 2011 to purchase the operator remaining 58,000 net acres at a total cost of approximately $209 million, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions. in the event that we do not exercise the purchase option, the operator has the option to put the remaining 58,000 acres to us at a total cost, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions, of approximately $92 million. we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. we acquired approximately 177,000 net acres within the niobrara play in the dj basin of northern colorado and southeast wyoming. we expect to commence drilling in 2011 and will leverage our bakken operating experience. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our existing wyoming fields averaged 24 mbpd and 106 mmcfd in 2010. we plan to drill approximately 20 company operated wells in 2011 in the big horn, wind river and powder river basins. 3 table of contents index to financial statements we hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the u.s. in the appalachian basin we hold 80,000 net acres in the marcellus shale natural gas play in pennsylvania and west virginia. in february 2011, we entered into a joint venture with a company on a large portion of our marcellus shale acreage position. under the agreement terms, the company will to earn 50 percent of approximately 60,000 acres under a drilling carry. the company also has an option to acquire our remaining acreage while we retain the rights to continue to market the acreage to others. we drilled three wells in 2010 and five in 2009. in louisiana and east texas, we hold 20,000 net acres in the haynesville shale natural gas play, where we drilled two wells in 2010 and one in 2009. we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. we have operated and outside-operated interests in ten fields and hold a 51 to 100 percent working interest in each. typically, our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. in 2010, we drilled three operated wells in alaska and plan to drill one to three company-operated wells per year during 2011 and 2012. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. the three potential in-situ developments are namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest, birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest, and ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest. initial test drilling on the birchwood prospect confirmed bitumen presence and an additional 70 test wells are planned in 2011 to assess reservoir quality. sanction of the initial phase of the birchwood development is anticipated in 2014, with resulting first production expected in 2016. africa equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field which is offshore equatorial guinea. during 2010, equatorial guinea net liquid hydrocarbon sales were 15 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales were 46 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price for the british thermal units used in the operations of the lpg plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and lpg. during 2010, a gross 753 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2010 included 3 mbpd of secondary condensate and 11 mbpd of lpg produced by alba plant llc. as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ), both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. during 2010, a gross 108 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 623 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba field for later production. we hold a 63 percent operated interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the corona well on block d. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline. angola offshore angola, we hold 10 percent interests in block 31 and block 32, both of which are outside-operated. the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the psvm development. the psvm development will utilize a floating, production, storage and offloading ( fpso ) vessel. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned with development drilling currently underway. first production is anticipated in 2012. other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. a development area in the south eastern portion of block 32 is currently being evaluated with the potential to include 6 fields for an anticipated first oil production in 2016. 4 table of contents index to financial statements libya we hold a 16 percent interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2010 included the drilling of 10 wells, including 2 carry over wells from 2009: seven of these wells were discoveries, two were dry and abandoned, and one was drilling as of yearend. we drilled 28 development wells in libya in 2010. phase ii of the faregh project began commissioning during the third quarter of 2010, with production coming on line in november. europe norway norway continues to be a core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed below. we were approved for our first operatorship on the offshore norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate ten licenses and hold interests in over 240,000 net acres. the operated alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf commenced production in june 2008. the complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading ( fpso ) vessel with subsea infrastructure. improved reliability, combined with optimization work, increased the throughput of the fpso to 142 mbpd, up from the original design of 120 mbpd. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the existing u.k. scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system using a 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. first production to the complex was from the alvheim development which is comprised of the kameleon, east kameleon and kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. at the end of 2010, the alvheim development included 11 producing wells and 2 water disposal wells. a phase 2 drilling program commenced in 2010, with 1 well on production since december 2010 and a further two production wells to be drilled in 2011. a phase 2b drilling program consisting of 2 production wells is planned for 2011 and 2012. the nearby outside-operated vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. in june 2009, we completed the drilling program for the volund field as a subsea tieback to the alvheim complex. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated interest, is located approximately five miles south of the alvheim area and consists of three production wells and one water injection well. first production from volund was announced in september 2009. in the second quarter of 2010, we commenced production at the volund field which allows us to maintain full capacity on the alvheim fpso. net sales from alvheim, vilje, and volund for 2010 averaged 50 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 30 mmcfd of natural gas. also offshore norway, we and our partners announced the marihone and viper discoveries, both located within tie-back distance of the alvheim fpso. the marihone oil discovery is located in license pl340 about 12 miles south of the volund and alvheim fields. we hold a 65 percent operated working interest in marihone. the viper oil discovery is located immediately next to volund field in pl203, about 12 miles south of the alvheim fpso. we are the operator and hold a 65 percent interest in viper. conceptual development studies for both discoveries have begun. first production for both discoveries is anticipated in 2014. in december 2010 a sales agreement was entered into for all of our interests in production licenses pl 025, pl 048e and pl 187. the transaction includes our outside-operated 20 percent interest in pl 025 (gudrun field development) and pl 187 (brynhild discovery), and 12.5 percent interest in pl 048e (eirin discovery). united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. a two well development program commenced in 2010 for west brae with one well on production in january 2011, and the second expected to produce by the end of march 2011. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. the east brae platform hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 30 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. most recently, in 2010, we agreed to commence construction and installation of a new module to accommodate the tie back of the third-party operated devenick field. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated sage system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion 5 table of contents index to financial statements cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. in the u.k. atlantic margin west of the shetland islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the fpso is being upgraded which is expected to extend the life of this asset through 2021. poland in 2010, we added 10 licenses with shale gas potential in poland, increasing our total acreage position to approximately 2.3 million net acres in 11 licenses. we have a 100 percent interest and operate all 11 blocks. in 2011 we plan to acquire 2d seismic over all concessions by the end of the third quarter and plan to initiate drilling in the fourth quarter. we have recently been successful in farming-out a portion of our interest in this play. under the agreement, our partner will earn a 40 percent working interest in 10 licenses, as well as pay a promote on certain future seismic and well costs. this transaction is subject to the approval of the polish ministry of the environment. we will remain operator of the 10 licenses included in the agreement. other international indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block located both onshore &amp; offshore sulawesi in the makassar strait, indonesia. the pasangkayu block covers an area of approximately 872,000 acres and is located directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3d seismic acquisition in may 2008. in november 2010, the bravo-1 well in the northeastern portion of the pasangkayu block was drilled in a water depth of approximately 3,200 feet and reached a total depth of 9,000 feet. no hydrocarbon accumulations were present. the romeo prospect, located on the north-central portion of the pasangkayu block in a water depth of 6,200 feet, is being drilled and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2011. in 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the kumawa block, an indonesia offshore exploration block, located offshore west papua. an increase in ownership to 55 percent received indonesian government approval in late 2010. the kumawa block encompasses 1.24 million acres. a seismic survey was acquired in 2010 and we expect to drill one exploration well in 2012. in october 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the bone bay block offshore sulawesi. an increase in ownership to 55 percent received indonesian government approval in late 2010. the bone bay block covers an area of 1.23 million acres and is 200 miles southeast of our pasangkayu block. a 2d seismic survey was acquired in 2009 and we expect to drill one exploration well in early 2012. we continue to pursue joint study agreements in indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. we completed one joint study agreement in 2010 and continue to evaluate regional potential for other opportunities. iraqi kurdistan region in october 2010, we acquired a position in four exploration blocks in the kurdistan region of iraq. we have signed production sharing agreements for operatorship and an 80 percent ownership in two open blocks northeast of erbil; harir and safen. the kurdistan regional government ( krg ) will hold a 20 percent carried interest. we were assigned working interests in two additional blocks located north-northwest of erbil; atrush, in which we have a 16 percent ownership (krg holds a 4 percent carried interest), and sarsang, in which we have a 20 ownership (krg holds a 4 percent carried interest). these contracts provide us with access to approximately 368,000 net acres. we have committed to a seismic program and to drilling one well on each of the two open blocks during the initial three-year exploration period. the atrush and sarsang blocks each have one well currently drilling. divestitures angola in february 2010, we closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent interest in the outside-operated production sharing contract and joint operating agreement on block 32 offshore angola effective january 1, 2009. we retained a 10 percent interest in block 32. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the timing of production from the ozona development in the gulf of mexico, the psvm development on block 31 offshore angola and block 32 and other possible developments. some factors which could possible affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and 6 table of contents index to financial statements other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. productive and drilling wells for our e&amp;p segment, the

interest in the athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils. the aosp mining and extractions assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta and include the muskeg river mine which began bitumen production in 2003 and the jackpine mine which commenced phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010. as of december 31, 2010, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross (45,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. the upgrading assets are located at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. the first fully integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved in 2006. expansion 1 includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine, addition of a new processing train at the scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure. a 8 table of contents index to financial statements phased start-up of the jackpine mine operations began in the third quarter of 2010. at full capacity, the jackpine mine will add 100,000 gross bpd to our previously existing capacity. the expanded upgrader began the commissioning and start-up phase, which will continue into early 2011. stage 1 debottlenecking activities are scheduled to begin in 2011. potential future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain under review. a planned turnaround at the muskeg river mine and the upgrader occurred from march through may 2010. our net share of turnaround costs was $99 million. production as the aosp was halted in april 2010 before a staged resumption of operations in mid-may 2010. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile corridor pipeline. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the three major products that the scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil, heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the start-up of the expanded upgrader. factors which could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and delays or other risks customarily associated with start-up projects. 9 table of contents index to financial statements reserves estimated

the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. the above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. preparation of reserve estimates our estimation of economically producible volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates of reserves are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x. beginning december 31, 2009, reserve estimates are based upon the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the respective 12-month period ended december 31. in 2008, reserve estimates were based on prices at december 31. liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group, which includes our director of corporate reserves and her staff of coordinators. reserves estimates are developed and reviewed by qualified reserves estimators ( qre ). qre are engineers or geoscientists with a minimum of a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed marathon qualified reserve estimator training course. the reserve coordinators review all reserves estimates for all fields with proved reserves greater than 3 mmboe at a minimum of once every three years. any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by corporate reserves group management. all other proved reserve changes must be approved by a reserve coordinator. our director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and a master of business administration. her 36 years of experience in the industry include 25 with marathon. she is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the society of petroleum engineers ( spe ) oil and gas reserves committee ( ogrc ) since 2004, chairing in 2008 and 2009. as a member of the ogrc, she participated in the development of the petroleum resource management system ( prms ) and served on the technical program committee for a 2007 spe reserves estimation workshop: sharing the vision focusing on prms. she chaired the development of the ogrc comments on the sec proposed modernization of oil and gas reporting and was a member of the american petroleum institute ad hoc group that provided comments on the same topic. 11 table of contents index to financial statements estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by glj petroleum consultants of calgary, canada, third-party consultants. a copy of their december 31, 2010 report is filed as exhibit 99.1 to this form 10-k. the engineer responsible for the estimates of our oil sands mining reserves has 32 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. he is a member of spe, having served as regional director 1998 through 2001 and is a registered practicing professional engineer in the province of alberta. audits of estimates third-party consultants are engaged to audit the in-house reserve estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. we met this goal for the four-year period ended december 31, 2010, without conducting any third party audits in 2010. we established a tolerance level of 10 percent for reserve audits such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. this resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. this process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2009 or 2008. netherland, sewell and associates, inc. ( nsai ) prepared an independent estimate of december 31, 2008 reserves for the alba field in equatorial guinea. this reserve estimate was used by corporate reserves in much the same way third-party audits are now used. the nsai summary report is exhibit 99.2 to this form 10-k. the senior members of the nsai team have over fifty years of industry experience between them, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. the team lead has a master of science in mechanical engineering and is a member of spe. the senior technical advisor has a bachelor of science in geophysics and is a member of the society of exploration geophysicists, the american association of petroleum geologists and the european association of geoscientists and engineers. both are licensed in the state of texas. ryder scott company ( ryder scott ) performed audits of several of our fields in 2009. their summary report on audits performed in 2009 is exhibit 99.3 to this form 10-k. the team lead for ryder scott has over 19 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott. he has a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering, is a member of spe and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. the corporate reserves group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions. changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2010, 405 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, a decrease of 87 mmboe from december 31, 2009. the following table shows of the changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2010: beginning of year 492 revisions of previous estimates (30 ) extensions, discoveries, and other additions 71 transfer to developed (128 ) end of year 405 significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2010 include 28 mmboe for development drilling in our libya properties and 19 mmboe additional for development drilling in the bakken shale play. revisions include 26 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves reclassified as proved developed in equatorial guinea because operating pressures can be reduced more than originally anticipated with the existing equipment. transfers include the movement of 67 mmboe from proved undeveloped to proved developed due to start up for the jackpine mine expansion 1 in canada and 26 mmboe related to the commencement of production at the gulf of mexico droshky development in july 2010. costs incurred in the periods ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $1,463 million, $792 million and $1,189 million. projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as behind-pipe zones where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. of the 405 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2010, 30 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in 12 table of contents index to financial statements equatorial guinea that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004 and is expected to be completed in 2015. the timing of the installation of compression is being deferred as a result of better than expected reservoir performance. in addition, the north gialo project in libya is being executed by the operator, encompassing a continuous drilling program and designing, fabricating, and installing extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. in 2010, an engineering firm was awarded the bid for the front-end engineering and design activities. long lead items are expected to be procured in 2011 and first production is expected in 2016. there are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years. as of december 31, 2010, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2011 through 2015 are projected to be $884 million, $315 million, $379 million, $433 million, and $224 million. the timing of future projects and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. net production sold north america africa europe

(c) our businesses in ireland and gabon were sold in 2009 and were reported as discontinued operations. integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. egholdings has a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum ( mmtpa ) lng production facility on bioko island in equatorial guinea. lng from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term ending in 2024. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 3.7 million metric tonnes in 2010. in 2010, we continued discussions with the government of equatorial guinea and our partners regarding a potential second lng production facility on bioko island. we own a 30 percent outside-operated interest in a natural gas liquefaction plant in kenai alaska. this facility began first production in 1969 and we currently lease one 87,500 cubic meter tankers to transport lng to customers in japan. in february 2011 we, along with the plant operator, announced that exports would cease in spring of 2011. we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ampco owns a methanol plant located in malabo, equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field. gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 850,605 metric tonnes in 2010. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. 14 table of contents index to financial statements the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea. factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. refining, marketing and transportation we have refining, marketing and transportation operations concentrated primarily in the midwest, gulf coast and southeast regions of the u.s. we rank as the fifth largest crude oil refiner in the u.s. and the largest in the midwest. our operations include a six-plant refining network and an integrated terminal and transportation system which supplies wholesale and marathon-brand customers as well as our own retail operations. our wholly-owned retail marketing subsidiary speedway llc ( speedway ) is one of the largest company-owned and -operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the u.s. in december 2010, we sold our st. paul park, minnesota, refinery (including associated terminal, tankage and pipeline investments and 166 superamerica retail outlets (collectively, minnesota assets ). operations for the minnesota assets are included in all of the annual statistics reported. refining we currently own and operate six refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1,142 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ) of crude oil as detailed in the table below. crude oil refining capacity (mbpd) garyville, louisiana 464 catlettsburg, kentucky 212 robinson, illinois 206 detroit, michigan 106 canton, ohio 78 texas city, texas 76 total 1,142 during 2010, our refineries processed 1,173 mbpd of crude oil and 162 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. the refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. additionally, we manufacture aromatics, cumene, propane, propylene, and sulfur. our garyville, louisiana, refinery is located along the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana between new orleans and baton rouge. the garyville refinery is configured to processes heavy sour crude oil into products such as gasoline, distillates, sulfur, asphalt, propane, polymer grade propylene, isobutane and coke. an expansion project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 that increased garyville crude oil refining capacity, making it one of the largest refineries in the u.s. our garyville refinery has earned designation as a u.s. occupational safety and health administration (osha) voluntary protection program (vpp) star site. our catlettsburg, kentucky, refinery is located in northeastern kentucky on the western bank of the big sandy river, near the confluence with the ohio river. the catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, asphalt, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, propane, propylene and sulfur. our robinson, illinois, refinery is located in southeastern illinois. the robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, propane, propylene, sulfur and anode-grade coke. the robinson refinery has earned designation as an osha vpp star site. our detroit, michigan, refinery is located near interstate 75 in southwest detroit. it is the only petroleum refinery currently operating in michigan. the detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils, including canadian crude oils, into products such as gasoline, diesel, asphalt, slurry, propane, chemical grade propylene and sulfur. in 2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at this refinery, with a current projected cost of $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). this project will enable the refinery to process an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour crude oils, including canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 15 mbpd. construction 15 table of contents index to financial statements began in the first half of 2008 and reached 50 percent completion at december 31, 2010. the project is expected to be complete in the second half of 2012. our detroit refinery is certified as a michigan vpp star site. our canton, ohio, refinery is located approximately 60 miles southeast of cleveland, ohio. the canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel fuels, kerosene, propane, sulfur, asphalt, roofing flux, home heating oil and no. 6 industrial fuel oil. our texas city, texas, refinery is located on the texas gulf coast approximately 30 miles south of houston, texas. the refinery processes sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline, propane, chemical grade propylene, slurry, sulfur and aromatics. the above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. the transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of crude oil, feedstocks and intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently. the following table sets forth our refinery production

109.49 we sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and no. 1 and no. 2 fuel oils (including kerosene, jet fuel and diesel fuel) to wholesale marketing customers in the midwest, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the u.s. we sold 54 percent of our gasoline volumes and 88 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2010. the demand for gasoline is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically being at its highest levels during the summer months. we have blended ethanol into gasoline for over 20 years and expanded our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline averaged 68 mbpd in 2010, 60 mbpd in 2009 and 54 mbpd in 2008. the future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. we sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our marketing territory, including: chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin. we also sell biodiesel-blended diesel in illinois, kentucky and pennsylvania. we produce propane at all six of our refineries. propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers. we are a producer and marketer of petrochemicals and specialty products. product availability varies by refinery and includes benzene, cumene, dilute naphthalene oil, molten sulfur, propylene, toluene and xylene. we market propylene, cumene and sulfur domestically to customers in the chemical industry. we also have the capacity to produce 1,400 tons per day of anode grade coke at our robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry, and 5,600 tons per day of fuel grade coke at the garyville refinery, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications. we produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all six of our refineries. heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product. we have refinery based asphalt production capacity of up to 92 mbpd. we market asphalt through 33 owned or leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. we have a broad customer base, including approximately 641 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. we sell asphalt in the wholesale and cargo markets via rail and barge. we also produce asphalt cements, polymer modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts. we hold a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in clymers, indiana. we also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in greenville, ohio. both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner . pipeline transportation we own a system of pipelines through marathon pipe line llc ( mpl ) and ohio river pipe line llc ( orpl ), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the midwest and gulf coast regions to our refineries, our terminals and other pipeline systems. our mpl 17 table of contents index to financial statements and orpl wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1,707 miles of crude oil lines and 1,825 miles of refined product lines comprising 31 systems located in 11 states. the mpl common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the u.s., based on total barrels delivered. our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and federal energy regulatory commission regulations and guidelines, including published tariffs for the

capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from st. james, louisiana, to patoka, illinois; 26 percent undivided joint interest in the maumee pipeline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from lima, ohio, to samaria, michigan. we plan to construct, by the end of 2012, a new section of pipeline connecting an existing pipeline to our detroit refinery which will allow us to deliver additional supplies of canadian crude. the above discussion contains forward looking statements with respect to the plans to construct a new section of pipeline. factors which could affect these plans include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. 18 table of contents index to financial statements retail marketing speedway, our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in enon, ohio, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the speedway &reg; brand. diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. speedway retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. for eleven consecutive quarters ending september 30, 2010, speedway has been rated as the best convenience store chain in terms of overall customer satisfaction in a national consumer perception survey conducted by corporate research international &reg; . in 2010, harris interactive equitrend &reg; annual brand equity study named speedway &reg; the number one gasoline brand with consumers for the second year in a row. speedway speedy rewards , an industry-leading customer loyalty program, has built active membership to 3.5 million customers. as of december 31, 2010, speedway had 1,358 retail outlets in seven states. sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 13 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2010 and provide us with a base of ratable sales. revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $3,195 million in 2010, $3,109 million in 2009 and $2,838 million in 2008. the demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of speedway markets, with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season. margins from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based upon statistics compiled in the 2010 global upstream performance review published by ihs herold inc., we rank ninth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2009 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. based upon the the oil &amp; gas journal 2010 worldwide refinery survey , we rank fifth among u.s. petroleum companies on the basis of u.s. crude oil refining capacity as of december 31, 2010. we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. we believe we compete with about 56 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 91 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; ten refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded jobbers and dealers; and approximately 252 retailers in the retail sale of refined products. (a jobber is a business that does not carry out refining operations but supplies refiner-branded products to gasoline stations or convenience stores. dealers refer to retail service station or convenience store operators affiliated with a brand identity.) we compete in the convenience store industry through speedway retail outlets. the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. several nontraditional fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry and energy analysts international, inc. estimates such retailers had 12 percent of the u.s. gasoline market in 2010. our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. 19 table of contents index to financial statements environmental matters the public policy committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a crisis management team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. state, national and international legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are being proposed and, in some cases, promulgated. this legislation applies or could apply in countries in which we operate. potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response. in addition, many states where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters. new laws are being enacted, and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. in some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. these environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) is in the process of implementing regulations to address the national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. in connection with these standards, the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment, meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs. the proposed rule is directed at electric generating units, not refineries, and is expected to be finalized in 2011. however, we cannot reasonably estimate any final financial impact of the state actions to implement the catr until the epa has issued a final rule and states have taken further action to implement that rule. the epa is reviewing and is proposing to revise, all naaqs for criteria air pollutants. in january, 2010, the epa issued the final nitrogen dioxide standard. in addition, in june 2010, the epa published the final standard for sulfur dioxide. in december 2010, the epa announced that the final ozone rule will be completed by july 29, 2011. we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these revised naaqs standards until the implementing rules are established and judicial challenges over the revised naaqs standards are resolved. water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. in addition, we are regulated under opa-90, which amended the cwa. among other requirements, opa-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. also, in case of any such release, opa-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. opa-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. 20 table of contents index to financial statements additionally, opa-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in u.s. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from u.s. service, according to a phase-out schedule. all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of opa-90. we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa-90, and we have established spill prevention, control and countermeasures ( spcc ) plans for facilities subject to cwa spcc requirements. solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. the rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. besides affecting waste disposal practices, rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ( usts ) containing regulated substances. we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm&amp;t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from usts have occurred. federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states, which administer their own ust programs. our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. see item 3. legal proceedings environmental proceedings other proceedings for a discussion of these sites. the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work. the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies. in february 2009, the alberta energy resources conservation board ( ercb ) issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. the aosp joint venture operator submitted tailings management papers to the ercb (for both mines), that sets forth plans to comply with the directive and received approval (with conditions) in the second half of 2010. further new regulations or failure to comply (in a timely manner) could result in additional cost to us. other matters in 2007, the u.s. congress passed the energy independence and security act ( eisa ), which, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year 2020, and contains a second renewable fuel standard ( rfs2 ). the epa announced the final rfs2 regulations on february 4, 2010. the rfs2 requires 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuel usage in 2010, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. in the near term, the rfs2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. the rfs2 presents production and logistic challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries. the rfs2 has required, and will likely in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use. within the overall 36.0 billion gallon rfs2, eisa establishes an advanced biofuel rfs2 that begins with 0.95 billion gallons in 2010 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs2 include 1.15 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2010 (due to combining the 2009 and 2010 volumes), which is capped at 1.0 billion gallons starting in 2012, and 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel in 2010, increasing to 16.0 billion gallons by 2022. the epa has determined that 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel will not be produced in 2010 and has lowered the requirement to 5.0 million gallons. the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations. we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels. 21 table of contents index to financial statements on october 13, 2010, the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the caa to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent ( e10 ) to 15 percent ( e15 ) for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. there are numerous state and federal regulatory issues that would need to be addressed before e15 can be marketed for use in any traditional gasoline engines. the usx separation on december 31, 2001, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july 31, 2001, marathon completed the usx separation, in which: its wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. as a result of the usx separation, marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other. in connection with the usx separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization, marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the usx separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the usx separation. the following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements. financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former u.s. steel group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2033; sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel fairfield works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by united states steel; and certain other guarantees. the financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before december 31, 2011, united states steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. under the financial matters agreement, united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. however, united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases. the financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. united states steel obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. while no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, we have exposures to united states steel arising from the transaction discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 22 table of contents index to financial statements trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 29,677 active employees as of december 31, 2010. of that number, 19,147 were employees of speedway, most of whom were employed at our retail marketing outlets. certain hourly employees at our catlettsburg and canton refineries are represented by the united steel, paper and forestry, rubber, manufacturing, energy, allied industrial and service workers union under labor agreements that expire on january 31, 2012. certain employees at our texas city refinery are represented by the same union under a labor agreement that expires on march 31, 2012. the international brotherhood of teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is scheduled to expire on january 31, 2014. they also represent employees at the st. paul park refinery under a labor agreement that is scheduled to expire on may 31, 2012. the st. paul park refinery was sold effective december 1, 2010, however there is a transition services agreement in place. due to this agreement, we remain subject to the labor contracts until the employee transfer date. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 6 for transaction details. executive officers of the registrant the executive

of charge, by contacting our investor relations office. information contained on our website is not incorporated into this annual report on form 10-k or other securities filings. item 1a. risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. the proposed spin-off of mpc is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, which may not be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or may not achieve the intended results. we expect that the spin-off will be effective june 30, 2011. our ability to timely effect the spin-off is subject to several conditions, including among others, the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the irs, an independent tax opinion that the distribution of one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon will qualify as tax-free and the sec declaring effective the registration statement. we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spin-off in a timely fashion, if at all. for these and other reasons, the spin-off may not be completed on the terms or timeline contemplated. further, if the spin-off is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. any such difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we have requested a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service ( irs ) substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify under sections 355 and/or 368 of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. the private letter ruling will be based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also intend to obtain an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify under sections 355 and 368 of the code. the opinion will rely on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion will not be binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, or in refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products; utilization rates of refineries; 24 table of contents index to financial statements natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries; the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain. lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and market value of our securities. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. the proved reserve information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group or third-party consultants. the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were priced at the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2010, as well as other conditions in existence at the date. any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (bitumen is mined then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs, and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. 25 table of contents index to financial statements as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2009, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce our refining, marketing and transportation profitability and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins. the profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. we are a net purchaser of crude oil. a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the middle east. these purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. our overall refining, marketing and transportation profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. restrictions on u.s. gulf of mexico deepwater operations and similar action by countries where we do business could have a significant impact on our operations. although the deepwater drilling moratorium imposed by the u.s. department of the interior suspending outer continental shelf subsea and floating facility operations was lifted on october 12, 2010, we cannot predict when necessary plans and permits will be approved for renewed offshore drilling activity other than completions, interventions and workovers. an extended regulatory delay on other deepwater drilling activities in the gulf of mexico or changes in laws or 26 table of contents index to financial statements regulations affecting our operations in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and market value of our securities. in addition, other countries where we do business may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations, including deepwater areas that could have a similar material adverse effect. we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources, and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate: the united states, canada, european union ( eu ) and norway. our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions and emissions also arise from the use of our refined petroleum products by our customers. through 2010, these included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. these actions could result in increased: (1) costs to operate and maintain our facilities, (2) capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our refineries and other facilities, and (3) costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs or to produce fuels to meet low-carbon fuel standards. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell, reduce the supply of crude oils which can be used and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. legislation or regulatory activity that impacts or could impact our operations includes: epa issued a finding that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. in april of 2010, the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and light duty vehicles). the endangerment finding, along with the mobile source standard, and epa determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the caa, will lead to widespread regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions. as a result, the epa has issued a so-called tailoring rule to limit the applicability of the epa major permitting programs to larger sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as our refineries and a few large production facilities. although legal challenges have been filed against these epa actions, no court decisions are expected for another year or more and the epa permitting requirements will apply to our larger facilities starting in january 2011. epa has also announced its plan to develop refining sector new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions with standards to be proposed in december 2011 and final standards to be adopted in december 2012. in the u.s., the house of representatives and the senate each had their own form of cap-and-trade legislation to reduce carbon emissions in the congressional session ending in 2010. the house approved the waxman-markey bill in 2009 and the senate considered but did not approve any such legislation. similar legislation may be introduced in 2011 in the new congressional session or the legislation may seek to limit or delay implementation of the epa greenhouse gas emission requirements. among other actions, cap and trade systems require businesses that emit greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process. although not ratified in the united states, the kyoto protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. the non-binding copenhagen accord was reached in 2009 with the united states pledging to reduce emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. 27 table of contents index to financial statements the canadian federal government has not enacted greenhouse gas emission reduction legislation although in signing the copenhagen accord, reaffirmed its commitment to reduce the country emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. alberta enacted legislation effective in 2007 which requires large emission sources such as oil sands facilities to reduce their net emissions intensity by 12 percent as measured against their baseline emissions. sources may also comply by making a compliance obligation payment or by purchasing verifiable offsets. the european union emissions trading scheme ( eu ets ) is in its second phase which runs from 2008 to 2012, in which eu member governments provide a certain number of free allowances to facilities and a facility may purchase additional eu allowances from other facilities, traders and the government. for, 2010, our eu facilities have complied with the eu ets by using the allocated free allowances. norway, as a member of the european economic area, while not in the european union, has a carbon tax and also participates in the eu ets. for 2010, our norway facilities complied with the eu ets by purchasing carbon allowances in the market. the canadian federal government and province of alberta jointly announced their intent to partially fund the aosp quest carbon capture and storage ( quest ccs ) project. under the terms of their letters of intent, alberta would contribute 745 million canadian dollars and the government of canada would provide 120 million canadian dollars toward the project development. the quest project would store approximately 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide annually and should allow the aosp to meet canadian and alberta emission reduction requirements for the foreseeable future. the operator intends to finalize the government funding agreements in the first quarter of 2011. a final investment decision on the quest ccs project will be made at a later date, and is subject to regulatory approvals, stakeholder engagement, detailed engineering studies, as well as the agreement of joint venture partners. the state of california enacted legislation effective in 2007 capping california greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020 and is implementing this legislation through a low-carbon fuel standard and a cap-and-trade program. the low-carbon fuel standard is being challenged in court. new mexico has adopted a regulation which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from current levels by three percent annually starting in 2012. we have not conducted significant business in california in recent years and discontinued operations in new mexico in 2009, but other states where we have operations could adopt similar greenhouse gas limitations. although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products) associated with any legislation, regulation, the epa or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. private party litigation has also been brought against emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but we have not been named in those cases. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and /or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. 28 table of contents index to financial statements many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. this could affect our operational performance, financial position and reputation. financial market uncertainty could impact our ability to obtain future financing. in the future we may require financing to grow our business. financial institutions participate in our revolving credit facility and provide us with services including insurance, cash management, commercial letters of credit, derivative instruments, and short-term investments. a deterioration of the financial market conditions could significantly increase our costs associated with borrowing. our liquidity and our ability to access the credit and/or capital markets could also be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 67 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2010 was derived from production outside the united states and 72 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2010, were located outside the united states. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. in addition, a significant portion of the feedstock requirements for our refineries is satisfied through supplies originating in saudi arabia, kuwait, canada, mexico and various other foreign countries. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. there are many risks associated with operations in countries and in global markets, such as equatorial guinea, indonesia, libya and the iraqi kurdistan region, including changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen, synthetic crude oil or refined product pricing and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. in recent weeks, civil unrest, which began in tunisia, has spread to other parts of north africa and the middle east. there have been demonstrations by protestors demanding regime changes in countries such as egypt, libya, yemen and bahrain. some of these demonstrations have been violent particularly in libya where we have operations. if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the united states. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations; and imposition of trade sanctions by the u.s. government on libya. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. 29 table of contents index to financial statements actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the united states and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. in addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, severe weather and labor disputes. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport crude oil and refined products to, from and among facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision, acts of piracy and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. there has been a trend in recent years of litigation by attorneys general and other government officials seeking to recover civil damages from companies. we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 30 table of contents index to financial statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict, target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, gross margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production, sales, throughput or shipments of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, synthetic crude oil and refined products; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products; levels of reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business plan to create independent downstream company on january 13, 2011, the board of directors of marathon oil corporation ( marathon ) announced that it has approved moving forward with plans to spin off our downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) business, creating two independent energy companies: marathon petroleum corporation ( mpc ) and marathon oil corporation ( mro ). to effect the spin-off, we intend to distribute one common share of mpc for every two common shares of marathon held at a record date to be determined. the transaction is expected to be effective june 30, 2011, with distribution of mpc shares shortly thereafter. a tax ruling request was submitted to the u.s. internal revenue service ( irs ) regarding the tax-free nature of the spin-off and we anticipate a response during the second quarter of 2011. the above discussion of the plans to create an independent downstream company includes forward looking statements. factors which could affect the plans include board approval, receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the irs and a registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in 2001 as usx holdco, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation. as a result of a reorganization completed in july 2001, usx holdco, inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco, inc.) and (2) changed its name to usx corporation. in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the usx separation ), usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation. before december 31, 2001, marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: usx-marathon group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and usx-u.s. steel group common stock ( steel stock ), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. on december 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary united states steel corporation ( united states steel ) to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one-for-one basis. in connection with the usx separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on december 31, 2001, and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date. segment and geographic information our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) exploration and production ( e&amp;p ) explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) oil sands mining ( osm ) mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in alberta, canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and 1 table of contents index to financial statements market synthetic crude oil; 3) integrated gas ( ig ) markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ( lng ) and methanol, on a worldwide basis; and 4) refining, marketing and transportation ( rm&amp;t ) refines, transports and markets crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the midwest, gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states. for operating segment and geographic financial information, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. the e&amp;p, osm and ig segments comprise our upstream operations. the rm&amp;t segment comprises our downstream operations. exploration and production in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. at the end of 2010, we were conducting oil and gas exploration, development or production activities in ten countries: the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, indonesia, libya, norway, poland, the iraqi kurdistan region, and the united kingdom. our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 245 thousand barrels per day ( mbpd ). our 2010 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 878 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ). in total, our 2010 worldwide net sales averaged 391 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ( mboepd ). for purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ( mcf ) by six. the liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe. in the united states during 2010, we drilled 77 gross (36 net) exploratory wells of which 73 gross (32 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. of these 73 wells, 35 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. internationally, we drilled 10 gross (2 net) exploratory wells of which 7 gross (1 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. all 7 wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at december 31, 2010. north america united states our u.s. operations accounted for 29 percent of our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 41 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes. offshore the gulf of mexico continues to be a core area, with over 20 prospects. at year end 2010, we held material interests in seven producing fields, four of which are company operated. an eighth field is under development and anticipated to come on-line in 2011. gulf of mexico drilling moratorium on april 22, 2010, the deepwater horizon, a rig that was engaged in drilling operations in the deepwater gulf of mexico, sank after an explosion and fire. the incident resulted in a significant oil spill in the gulf of mexico. marathon had no involvement in the incident. as a result of the deepwater horizon incident, the u.s. department of the interior issued a drilling moratorium on may 30, 2010, to suspend the drilling of deepwater wells, and prohibit drilling any new deepwater wells (defined as greater than 500 foot water depth). shortly after the moratorium was issued, we temporarily suspended drilling an exploratory well on the innsbruck prospect, located on mississippi canyon block 993. although the drilling moratorium was lifted on october 12, 2010, it is not known when plans and permits will be approved for future deepwater drilling activity. we sent a revised development operations coordination document for the ozona completion and a revised exploration plan for the innsbruck well to the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement ( boemre ). we continue to update our revised oil spill response plan as new and updated requirements come from the boemre. we filed our first deepwater exploration plan since the deepwater horizon incident to the boemre on october 15, 2010. we are continuing to engage the boemre to provide them with all the requested information. the boemre has not yet deemed our plan submitted. the effects of new or additional laws or regulations that may be adopted in response to this incident are not fully known at this time and may impact future project execution. we operate the ewing bank 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the ewing bank 873 (lobster), ewing bank 917 (oyster) and ewing bank 963 (arnold) fields. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. 2 table of contents index to financial statements we own a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830. the petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. the neptune development commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in july 2008. we hold a 30 percent working interest in this outside-operated development located on atwater valley 575, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the completed phase i development included six subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. phase ii development activities have begun and the first well in this program was successfully drilled and completed in late 2009. our droshky development in the gulf of mexico on green canyon block 244 began production in mid-july of 2010 and reached peak net production of 45,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2010. production declines have been steeper than anticipated due to reservoir compartmentalization and lack of aquifer support. this subsea project consists of four development wells tied back to a third-party platform. three of the four wells are currently producing. we plan to re-enter the fourth well in the first quarter of 2011. we hold a 100 percent operated working interest and an 81 percent net revenue interest in droshky. development of our operated ozona prospect, located on garden banks block 515, has also continued. we are in the process of securing a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby third-party auger platform. first production of liquid hydrocarbon is expected in 2011. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. in 2008, we drilled a successful oil appraisal well on the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508. we hold a 25 percent interest in the outside-operated stones prospect. in the third quarter of 2008, we announced deepwater oil discovery on the gunflint prospect located on mississippi canyon block 948. we own a 13 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater oil discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 10 percent interest in the outside-operated prospect. in december 2009, we began drilling an exploratory well on the flying dutchman prospect, located on green canyon block 511 in the gulf of mexico. we have 63 percent ownership and are the operator of this liquid hydrocarbon prospect. the flying dutchman reached its targeted total depth in early may 2010. the well encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands that require further technical evaluation. the results of the flying dutchman well will continue to be evaluated to determine overall commerciality. in addition to the prospects listed above, we held interests in 103 blocks in the gulf of mexico at the end of 2010, including 97 in the deepwater area. our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in 2011 and 2012, presuming a favorable regulatory environment that will allow deep-water drilling to resume. onshore we hold 391,000 net acres in the bakken shale oil play in the williston basin of north dakota with a working interest of approximately 80 percent. approximately 275 company-operated locations will be drilled over the next 4 years. we are evaluating other potential horizons above and below the middle bakken. we currently have six operated drilling rigs running in our bakken shale program, and will add a rig solely dedicated to completion operations in the first quarter of 2011. in the anadarko woodford shale horizon, a liquids-rich play in oklahoma, we continue to expand our acreage position and now hold approximately 88,000 net acres within the play. we have existing production operations in this geographical area which will facilitate early drilling, with initial wells currently in progress. we plan to increase from three to eight company operated rigs in 2011. we also have domestic natural gas operations in oklahoma, east texas, and north louisiana with combined net gas sales of 103 mmcfd in 2010. in december 2010, we entered into an agreement with an operator in the eagle ford shale, a liquids-rich play in texas. we initially paid $10 million and will drill and complete four wells to earn approximately 17,000 net acres. we also have an option that expires october 31, 2011 to purchase the operator remaining 58,000 net acres at a total cost of approximately $209 million, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions. in the event that we do not exercise the purchase option, the operator has the option to put the remaining 58,000 acres to us at a total cost, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions, of approximately $92 million. we hold leases with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in garfield county in the greater grand valley field complex. we acquired approximately 177,000 net acres within the niobrara play in the dj basin of northern colorado and southeast wyoming. we expect to commence drilling in 2011 and will leverage our bakken operating experience. net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our existing wyoming fields averaged 24 mbpd and 106 mmcfd in 2010. we plan to drill approximately 20 company operated wells in 2011 in the big horn, wind river and powder river basins. 3 table of contents index to financial statements we hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the u.s. in the appalachian basin we hold 80,000 net acres in the marcellus shale natural gas play in pennsylvania and west virginia. in february 2011, we entered into a joint venture with a company on a large portion of our marcellus shale acreage position. under the agreement terms, the company will to earn 50 percent of approximately 60,000 acres under a drilling carry. the company also has an option to acquire our remaining acreage while we retain the rights to continue to market the acreage to others. we drilled three wells in 2010 and five in 2009. in louisiana and east texas, we hold 20,000 net acres in the haynesville shale natural gas play, where we drilled two wells in 2010 and one in 2009. we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska. we have operated and outside-operated interests in ten fields and hold a 51 to 100 percent working interest in each. typically, our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. in 2010, we drilled three operated wells in alaska and plan to drill one to three company-operated wells per year during 2011 and 2012. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of western in 2007. the three potential in-situ developments are namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest, birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest, and ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest. initial test drilling on the birchwood prospect confirmed bitumen presence and an additional 70 test wells are planned in 2011 to assess reservoir quality. sanction of the initial phase of the birchwood development is anticipated in 2014, with resulting first production expected in 2016. africa equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest in the alba field which is offshore equatorial guinea. during 2010, equatorial guinea net liquid hydrocarbon sales were 15 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales were 46 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) processing plant. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price for the british thermal units used in the operations of the lpg plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and lpg. during 2010, a gross 753 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2010 included 3 mbpd of secondary condensate and 11 mbpd of lpg produced by alba plant llc. as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ( ampco ) and 60 percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited ( egholdings ), both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. during 2010, a gross 108 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 623 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba field for later production. we hold a 63 percent operated interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the corona well on block d. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline. angola offshore angola, we hold 10 percent interests in block 31 and block 32, both of which are outside-operated. the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of block 31. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the psvm development. the psvm development will utilize a floating, production, storage and offloading ( fpso ) vessel. a total of 48 production and injection wells are planned with development drilling currently underway. first production is anticipated in 2012. other discoveries on block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. a development area in the south eastern portion of block 32 is currently being evaluated with the potential to include 6 fields for an anticipated first oil production in 2016. 4 table of contents index to financial statements libya we hold a 16 percent interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin. our exploration program in 2010 included the drilling of 10 wells, including 2 carry over wells from 2009: seven of these wells were discoveries, two were dry and abandoned, and one was drilling as of yearend. we drilled 28 development wells in libya in 2010. phase ii of the faregh project began commissioning during the third quarter of 2010, with production coming on line in november. europe norway norway continues to be a core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the u.k. sector of the north sea discussed below. we were approved for our first operatorship on the offshore norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate ten licenses and hold interests in over 240,000 net acres. the operated alvheim complex located on the norwegian continental shelf commenced production in june 2008. the complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading ( fpso ) vessel with subsea infrastructure. improved reliability, combined with optimization work, increased the throughput of the fpso to 142 mbpd, up from the original design of 120 mbpd. produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the existing u.k. scottish area gas evacuation ( sage ) system using a 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. first production to the complex was from the alvheim development which is comprised of the kameleon, east kameleon and kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. at the end of 2010, the alvheim development included 11 producing wells and 2 water disposal wells. a phase 2 drilling program commenced in 2010, with 1 well on production since december 2010 and a further two production wells to be drilled in 2011. a phase 2b drilling program consisting of 2 production wells is planned for 2011 and 2012. the nearby outside-operated vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. in june 2009, we completed the drilling program for the volund field as a subsea tieback to the alvheim complex. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated interest, is located approximately five miles south of the alvheim area and consists of three production wells and one water injection well. first production from volund was announced in september 2009. in the second quarter of 2010, we commenced production at the volund field which allows us to maintain full capacity on the alvheim fpso. net sales from alvheim, vilje, and volund for 2010 averaged 50 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 30 mmcfd of natural gas. also offshore norway, we and our partners announced the marihone and viper discoveries, both located within tie-back distance of the alvheim fpso. the marihone oil discovery is located in license pl340 about 12 miles south of the volund and alvheim fields. we hold a 65 percent operated working interest in marihone. the viper oil discovery is located immediately next to volund field in pl203, about 12 miles south of the alvheim fpso. we are the operator and hold a 65 percent interest in viper. conceptual development studies for both discoveries have begun. first production for both discoveries is anticipated in 2014. in december 2010 a sales agreement was entered into for all of our interests in production licenses pl 025, pl 048e and pl 187. the transaction includes our outside-operated 20 percent interest in pl 025 (gudrun field development) and pl 187 (brynhild discovery), and 12.5 percent interest in pl 048e (eirin discovery). united kingdom our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae a platform and facilities host the underlying south brae field and the adjacent central and west brae fields. a two well development program commenced in 2010 for west brae with one well on production in january 2011, and the second expected to produce by the end of march 2011. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae b platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. the east brae platform hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of 30 third-party fields have contracted to use the brae system. most recently, in 2010, we agreed to commence construction and installation of a new module to accommodate the tie back of the third-party operated devenick field. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated sage system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion 5 table of contents index to financial statements cubic feet ( bcf ) per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. in the u.k. atlantic margin west of the shetland islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the fpso is being upgraded which is expected to extend the life of this asset through 2021. poland in 2010, we added 10 licenses with shale gas potential in poland, increasing our total acreage position to approximately 2.3 million net acres in 11 licenses. we have a 100 percent interest and operate all 11 blocks. in 2011 we plan to acquire 2d seismic over all concessions by the end of the third quarter and plan to initiate drilling in the fourth quarter. we have recently been successful in farming-out a portion of our interest in this play. under the agreement, our partner will earn a 40 percent working interest in 10 licenses, as well as pay a promote on certain future seismic and well costs. this transaction is subject to the approval of the polish ministry of the environment. we will remain operator of the 10 licenses included in the agreement. other international indonesia we are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the pasangkayu block located both onshore &amp; offshore sulawesi in the makassar strait, indonesia. the pasangkayu block covers an area of approximately 872,000 acres and is located directly east of the kutei basin production region. the production sharing contract with the indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3d seismic acquisition in may 2008. in november 2010, the bravo-1 well in the northeastern portion of the pasangkayu block was drilled in a water depth of approximately 3,200 feet and reached a total depth of 9,000 feet. no hydrocarbon accumulations were present. the romeo prospect, located on the north-central portion of the pasangkayu block in a water depth of 6,200 feet, is being drilled and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2011. in 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the kumawa block, an indonesia offshore exploration block, located offshore west papua. an increase in ownership to 55 percent received indonesian government approval in late 2010. the kumawa block encompasses 1.24 million acres. a seismic survey was acquired in 2010 and we expect to drill one exploration well in 2012. in october 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the bone bay block offshore sulawesi. an increase in ownership to 55 percent received indonesian government approval in late 2010. the bone bay block covers an area of 1.23 million acres and is 200 miles southeast of our pasangkayu block. a 2d seismic survey was acquired in 2009 and we expect to drill one exploration well in early 2012. we continue to pursue joint study agreements in indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. we completed one joint study agreement in 2010 and continue to evaluate regional potential for other opportunities. iraqi kurdistan region in october 2010, we acquired a position in four exploration blocks in the kurdistan region of iraq. we have signed production sharing agreements for operatorship and an 80 percent ownership in two open blocks northeast of erbil; harir and safen. the kurdistan regional government ( krg ) will hold a 20 percent carried interest. we were assigned working interests in two additional blocks located north-northwest of erbil; atrush, in which we have a 16 percent ownership (krg holds a 4 percent carried interest), and sarsang, in which we have a 20 ownership (krg holds a 4 percent carried interest). these contracts provide us with access to approximately 368,000 net acres. we have committed to a seismic program and to drilling one well on each of the two open blocks during the initial three-year exploration period. the atrush and sarsang blocks each have one well currently drilling. divestitures angola in february 2010, we closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent interest in the outside-operated production sharing contract and joint operating agreement on block 32 offshore angola effective january 1, 2009. we retained a 10 percent interest in block 32. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the timing of production from the ozona development in the gulf of mexico, the psvm development on block 31 offshore angola and block 32 and other possible developments. some factors which could possible affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and 6 table of contents index to financial statements other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. productive and drilling wells for our e&amp;p segment, the

interest in the athabasca oil sands project ( aosp ), an oil sands mining joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils. the aosp mining and extractions assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta and include the muskeg river mine which began bitumen production in 2003 and the jackpine mine which commenced phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010. as of december 31, 2010, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross (45,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. the upgrading assets are located at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. the first fully integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved in 2006. expansion 1 includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine, addition of a new processing train at the scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure. a 8 table of contents index to financial statements phased start-up of the jackpine mine operations began in the third quarter of 2010. at full capacity, the jackpine mine will add 100,000 gross bpd to our previously existing capacity. the expanded upgrader began the commissioning and start-up phase, which will continue into early 2011. stage 1 debottlenecking activities are scheduled to begin in 2011. potential future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain under review. a planned turnaround at the muskeg river mine and the upgrader occurred from march through may 2010. our net share of turnaround costs was $99 million. production as the aosp was halted in april 2010 before a staged resumption of operations in mid-may 2010. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile corridor pipeline. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the three major products that the scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil, heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the start-up of the expanded upgrader. factors which could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and delays or other risks customarily associated with start-up projects. 9 table of contents index to financial statements reserves estimated

(c) includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 22 mmcfd and 32 mmcfd in 2009 and 2008. (d) excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments and the unrealized effects of u.k. natural gas contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. e&amp;p segment revenues included derivative losses of $13 million in 2009 and gains of $22 million in 2008. excluded from e&amp;p segment revenues were gains of $72 million in 2009 and $218 million in 2008 related to natural gas sales contracts in the u.k. that were accounted for as derivative instruments. these u.k contracts expired in september 2009. osm segment revenues decreased $490 million from 2008 to 2009. revenues were impacted by net gains of $13 million in 2009 and $48 million in 2008 on derivative instruments, which expired december 2009. excluding the derivatives, the decrease in revenue reflects the almost 40 percent decline in synthetic crude oil realizations. synthetic crude oil sales volumes were consistent between the years. rm&amp;t segment revenues decreased $18,951 million from 2008 to 2009 matching relative price level changes. while our overall refined product sales volumes in 2009 were relatively unchanged compared to 2008, the level of average petroleum prices declined significantly as shown in item 1. business refining, marketing and transportation. the level of crude oil prices has a direct influence on our refined product prices. the table below shows the average annual refined product benchmark prices for our marketing area. (dollars per gallon) 2009 2008 chicago spot unleaded regular gasoline $ 1.68 $ 2.50 chicago spot ultra-low sulfur diesel $ 1.66 $ 2.95 u.s. gulf coast spot unleaded regular gasoline $ 1.64 $ 2.48 u.s. gulf coast spot ultra-low sulfur diesel $ 1.66 $ 2.93 sales to related parties decreased in 2009 as a result of the sale of our interest in pilot travel centers llc ( ptc ) during the fourth quarter of 2008. income from equity method investments decreased $467 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily as the result of lower commodity prices on the earnings of many of our equity investees in 2009 and the sale of our equity method investment in ptc during the fourth quarter of 2008. net gain on disposal of assets in 2009 includes our gain on the sale of our operated and a portion of our outside-operated permian basin producing assets in new mexico and west texas, plus sales of other oil and gas properties and retail stores. in 2008, we sold our outside-operated interests (24 percent of heimdal field, 47 percent of vale field and 20 percent of skirne field) and associated undeveloped acreage in offshore norway and our share of the ptc joint venture in 2008. 45 table of contents index to financial statements cost of revenues decreased $19,135 million from 2008 to 2009. the largest decreases were in the rm&amp;t segment and resulted from lower acquisition costs of crude oil. acquisition costs for refinery charge and blendstocks and for purchased refined products also decreased. in our other segments, lower commodity prices and the related lower energy costs also contributed to the lower cost of revenues. depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $496 million in 2009 from 2008. the increase in 2009 primarily relates to higher sales volumes, particularly from the alvheim/vilje development offshore norway and the neptune development in the gulf of mexico, both of which commenced production mid-year 2008. goodwill impairment expense of $1,412 million in 2008 relates to our osm reporting unit. there were no such impairments in 2009. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk). ig segment income decreased $212 million, or 70 percent, from 2008 to 2009. the decrease in income was primarily the result of lower realizations for lng and methanol. as evidenced by higher sales volumes, strong operational reliability at the eg lng facility throughout 2009 partially offset the impact of lower prices. the lng production facility averaged higher than 95 percent operational availability during 2009. we hold a 60 percent interest in the facility. rm&amp;t segment income decreased $715 million, or 61 percent, from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of the decrease in our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon from 11.66 cents in 2008 to 6.10 cents in 2009. the gross margin decline is a result of a 52 percent narrowing of the sweet/sour differential, thereby increasing the relative cost of crude processed by our refineries. the narrowing of the sweet/sour differential resulted from a variety of worldwide economic and petroleum industry related factors primarily related to lower hydrocarbon demand. included in the refining and wholesale marketing gross margins were pretax derivative losses of $83 million in 2009 and $87 million in 2008. for a more complete explanation of our strategies to manage market risk related to commodity prices, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. we averaged 957 mbpd of crude oil throughput in 2009 and 944 mbpd in 2008. total refinery throughputs averaged 1,153 mbpd in 2009 compared to 1,151 mbpd in 2008. crude and total throughputs were lower in 2008 than in 2009 in part due to the impact that hurricanes and other weather related events had on our operations in 2008. the following table includes certain key operating statistics for the rm&amp;t segment for 2009 and 2008. rm&amp;t operating statistics 2009 2008 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.0610 $ 0.1166 refined products sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) 1,378 1,352 (a) sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. management discussion and analysis of financial condition, cash flows and liquidity cash flows net cash provided from operating activities totaled $5,873 million in 2010 compared to $5,268 million in 2009 and $6,752 million in 2008. the $605 million increase in 2010 reflects the impact of higher average realized prices in 2010. the $1,484 million decrease in 2009 primarily reflects the impact of lower average realized prices in 2009. net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,621 million in 2010, compared with $5,238 million in 2009 and $5,405 million in 2008. significant investing activities include additions to property, plant and equipment and asset disposals. the most significant additions to property, plant and equipment relate to our long-term projects, which cross several years. in our e&amp;p segment, exploration and development projects in angola impacted all three years. development and completion of the alvheim/vilje project affected 2008, with other developments in the area in 2009 and 2010. beginning in 2008, spending on u.s. exploration and development projects in the gulf of mexico and unconventional resource plays became a more significant portion of our additions to property, plant and equipment. in the osm segment, the aosp expansion 1 began in 2008 and continued through most 2010. in our rm&amp;t segment, the expansion of our garyville, 47 table of contents index to financial statements louisiana, refinery affected 2008 and 2009. also in rm&amp;t, the expansion and upgrading of our detroit, michigan refinery commenced in 2007 with front-end engineering and design work and construction in 2008 through 2010. disposal of assets totaled $2,131 million, $865 million and $999 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. in 2010, we closed the sale of our 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in the production sharing contract and joint operating agreement in block 32 offshore angola for $1.3 billion. additionally, our rm&amp;t segment assets in minnesota were sold in december 2010. in 2009, we sold all of our operated and outside-operated interests in ireland and gabon, reporting the disposals as discontinued operations. we also sold our operated and a portion of our outside-operated permian basin producing assets in new mexico and west texas. in 2008, disposal of assets included proceeds from the sale of our outside-operated interests and related undeveloped acreage in norway and our share of ptc. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about dispositions. net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,358 million in 2010, compared with cash provided from financing activities of $724 million in 2009 and cash used in financing activities of $1,193 million in 2008. in 2010, $500 million aggregate principal value of debt was repaid at a weighted average price of 117 percent of face value under two tender offers. sources of cash included the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes in 2009, the issuance of $1.0 billion in senior notes in 2008. repayments of debt and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plan were significant uses of cash in 2008, while dividend payments impacted every year. liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, and our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility. because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, share repurchase program, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. 2011 activities on plan to create independent downstream company on february 1, 2011, mpc, currently a wholly owned subsidiary of marathon, completed a private placement of three series of senior notes aggregating $3 billion (the notes ). the notes are intended to establish a minimum $750 million initial cash balance for mpc upon the planned spin off of marathon downstream business. all cash above that level will be used to repay existing intercompany debt with marathon, and any remaining proceeds will be distributed to marathon on or before june 30, 2011. the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of mpc which are guaranteed by marathon on a senior unsecured basis. marathon guarantees will terminate upon completion of the spin-off. on january 27, 2011, marathon commenced cash tender offers for certain specified series of outstanding debt, including that of its wholly owned subsidiary, marathon oil canada corporation (formerly known as western oil sands inc.). the tender offers are for any and all of four series of outstanding notes and a maximum of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of three additional series of marathon outstanding notes. in the any and all offer, $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes was tendered and accepted with a settlement date of february 10, 2011. in the maximum tender offer, $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes was tendered, of which $500 million was accepted, and settled on february 25, 2011. in february 2011, marathon gave notice in accordance with the make whole call provisions of the respective indentures that we will redeem $798 million in addition to the $1.2 billion any and all offer and the $500 million maximum tender offer, for a total principal amount of $2.5 billion to be redeemed by the end of the first quarter of 2011. see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. expected future taxable income we must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and future financial conditions. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. in determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider proved and, in some cases, probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. in assessing the release of an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset. additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plans and our unfunded u.s. retiree health care plans due to the different projected liability durations of 8 years and 12 years. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary discount rate modeling tool. this tool applies a yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a hypothetical aa yield curve. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual discount rates from 1.5 to 30 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are included. each issue is required to have at least $150 million par value outstanding. the top quartile bonds are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield curve. 57 table of contents index to financial statements of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 5.05 percent for our u.s. pension plans and 5.55 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $150 million and $26 million and would increase annual defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $15 million and $1 million. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the u.s. funded pension plans and 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent debt securities for the international funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to our historical returns for reasonableness. decreasing the 8.5 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, synthetic crude oil and refined product prices. we employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. we believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. seerisk factors 22 risk factors, item 3. legal proceedings, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict, target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production or sales of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; levels of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was incorporated in 2001 and is an international energy company engaged in exploration and production, oil sands mining and integrated gas with operations in the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, indonesia, the iraqi kurdistan region, libya, norway, poland and the united kingdom. we are based in houston, texas with our corporate headquarters at 5555 san felipe road, houston, texas 77056-2723 and a telephone number of (713) 629-6600. 3 table of contents on june 30, 2011, the spin-off of marathon downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. marathon shareholders at the close of business on the record date of june 27, 2011 received one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon common stock held. fractional shares of mpc common stock were not distributed and any fractional share of mpc common stock otherwise issuable to a marathon shareholder was sold in the open market on such shareholder behalf, and such shareholder received a cash payment with respect to that fractional share. a private letter ruling received in june 2011 from the irs affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k, with additional information in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. strategy and results summary assets within our three segments are at various stages in their lifecycle: base, growth or exploration. we have a stable group of base assets, which include our osm and ig segments and e&amp;p assets in norway, equatorial guinea, libya, the u.k. and the u.s. these assets generate much of the cash that will be available for investment in our growth assets and exploration projects. growth assets are where we expect to make significant investment in order to realize oil and gas production and reserve increases. we are focused on u.s. liquid hydrocarbon growth by developing liquids-rich shale play positions, including most recently the establishment of a strong position in the core of the eagle ford shale play. in addition to the u.s. shale plays, growth assets include the development of angola block 31, our discoveries in the iraqi kurdistan region, select gulf of mexico blocks and our canadian in-situ assets. our areas of exploration are poland, the iraqi kurdistan region, norway and the gulf of mexico. we continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, with a previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 and $3.0 billion of non-core assets between 2011 and 2013. through january 2012, we closed such transaction having values of $640 million. we ended 2011 with proved reserves of 1.8 bboe, an 10 percent increase over 2010. average sales volumes were 219 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbon, 866 mmcfd of natural gas and 43 mbbld of synthetic crude oil, with 66 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from international operations, for which average realizations have exceeded wti prices. we invested in the development of assets in all our segments, totaling $3.4 billion in capital expenditures related to continuing operations for the year, with $3 billion related to our e&amp;p segment. we expect continued capital expenditures, primarily funded with cash flow from operations, in exploration and development activities in order to realize continued reserve and sales growth. see item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-outlook, for discussion of our $4.8 billion capital spending budget for 2012. the above discussion of strategy and results includes forward-looking statements with respect to the goal of divesting between $1.5 and $3.0 billion of non-core assets between 2011 and 2013 and expected investment in exploration and development activities. some factors that could potentially affect the divestiture of non-core assets and expected investment in exploration and development activities include changes in prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, actions of competitors, occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and natural gas properties, future financial condition and operating results, and economic, and/or regulatory factors affecting our businesses, the identification of buyers and the negotiation of acceptable prices and other terms, as well as other customary closing conditions. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 4 table of contents the map below illustrates the locations of our worldwide operations. segment and geographic information for operating segment and geographic financial information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. exploration and production segment in the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires. we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, indonesia, the iraqi kurdistan region, libya, norway, poland, and the united kingdom. liquids-rich shale plays eagle ford in the fourth quarter of 2011, we closed several acquisitions in the eagle ford shale play of south texas for a total cash consideration of $4.5 billion. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these acquisitions. upon finalization of the 2011 eagle ford acquisition transactions, we will have just over 300,000 net acres in the eagle ford shale with an average working interest of approximately 80 percent. as of december 31, 2011, we had 14 operated drilling rigs active in the play, with plans to increase to 18 drilling rigs and 4 dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews by the end of 2012. our plans include drilling and completing 200 230 gross (160 185 net) operated wells in 2012. including the impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions, annual net sales for 2011 were 2 mboed, with a december exit rate of 13 mboed. our production from the eagle ford shale is either sold at the lease or moved via truck or pipeline to markets. we own and operate the sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our recently purchased acreage in karnes, atascosa, and bee counties of south texas. our future production estimates will require additional markets, transportation, storage and plant processing to be either contracted or constructed and a variety of negotiations are underway with a goal of continued access to adequate infrastructure and markets. key considerations in this development will be the timing of contract availability and efforts to receive optimal price based upon delivery location. 5 table of contents bakken we hold just over 400,000 net acres in the bakken shale oil play in the williston basin of north dakota and eastern montana with an average working interest in the acreage of approximately 80 percent. throughout 2011, we continued selective acreage acquisitions and leasing, adding approximately 40,000 net acres which expanded to a new prospect area. in 2011 we drilled 61 gross (55 net) operated wells and completed 71 gross (63 net) operated wells. we also moved from 20-stage to 30-stage hydraulic fracturing, which increases both production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from the wells. at december 31, 2011, we had 7 operated drilling rigs and 2 dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews in our bakken shale program, and expect to add one more rig in 2012 to accomplish plans to drill 69 gross (53 net) and complete 72 84 gross (53 61 net) operated wells in 2012. our net sales from the bakken shale averaged 17 mboed in 2011, a 36 percent increase over 2010, and our production exit rate for 2011 was 24 mboed. we sell our bakken production into local markets predominately via trucking. a variety of negotiations are underway to provide adequate infrastructure and markets for our future estimated production levels, including the potential export of volumes from the regional markets via pipeline or rail projects. anadarko woodford in the anadarko woodford shale play in oklahoma, we hold 160,000 net acres of which approximately 100,000 acres are held by production. in 2011, we executed an operated drilling program focused on the liquids-rich areas of the play, drilling 15 gross (11 net) exploration and 8 gross (6 net) development wells, of which 11 gross (9 net) wells were completed. the shi randall well, in which we hold a 50 percent working interest, was completed in the third quarter of 2011. the shi randall had a gross ip of 455 bbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 6 mmcfd of natural gas, subject to pipeline constraints. it was one of the initial wells in the knox area (southern woodford) and is helping to prove up a prospective area where we have a strong acreage position. the anadarko woodford shale averaged net sales of 2 mboed during 2011. in 2012, we plan to maintain our current level of 6 rigs and drill 35 40 gross (19 22 net) operated wells with more focus on development drilling. outside-operated projects could add an additional 30 50 gross (6 10 net) wells. see below for additional discussion of our conventional, primarily natural gas production operations in oklahoma. dj basin in 2010, we began leasing in the niobrara play in the dj basin of northern colorado and southeast wyoming and built an acreage position of approximately 180,000 acres. in april 2011, we farmed-out a 30 percent undivided working interest retaining 70 percent and operatorship. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. as of december 31, 2011 we hold 151,000 net acres. in 2011, we drilled a total of 12 gross (7 net) operated wells, with four gross (two net) operated wells completed. we are currently operating 2 drilling rigs in the dj basin and expect to drill 25 35 gross (13 19 net) operated wells in 2012. outside-operated projects could add an additional 25 35 gross (4 5 net) wells. we exited december with a net production rate of 86 boed. we have other natural gas assets in colorado which are discussed below. united states alaska we produce natural gas in the cook inlet and adjacent kenai peninsula of alaska where we have operated and outside-operated interests in 10 fields covering 118,000 net acres. in 2011, we drilled 1 operated well in the ninilchik field and participated in 1 non-operated horizontal well in the mcarthur river field, both in the cook inlet. plans for 2012 include continued investments in production optimization and operational reliability. net natural gas sales from alaska averaged 94 mmcfd in 2011. typically, our natural gas sales from alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. to manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the kenai natural gas field. complementing our production operations in alaska is our majority ownership in four operated natural gas pipelines totaling 140 miles. these are bidirectional systems providing transportation from multiple producers to numerous end users in and around the cook inlet. colorado we hold leases of 8,700 net acres with natural gas production in the piceance basin of colorado, located in the greater grand valley field complex, with net sales of 20 mmcfd in 2011. currently the field has 77 gross/net wells producing. oklahoma we have long-established operated and non-operated conventional production operations in several oklahoma fields from which 2011 sales averaged 2 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 53 mmcfd of natural gas. in 2011 we participated in 7 gross (2 net), non-operated wells in the state. we also drilled 1 company operated well. plans for 2012 include 11 gross (2 net) wells, targeting liquids. 6 table of contents texas/north louisiana/new mexico in east texas and north louisiana, we hold 184,000 net acres. approximately 20,000 of the acres are in the haynesville and bossier natural gas shale plays. most of the acreage in these shale plays is held by production. we participated in 3 gross (1 net) non-operated wells in the area during 2011. conventional production was primarily from the mimms creek, pearwood and oletha fields, in 2011. net sales from east texas and north louisiana averaged 7 mboed. we also participate in several outside-operated permian basin fields in west texas and new mexico. net sales from this area were 7 mboed in 2011. activity in 2012 will center around carbon dioxide flood programs in the seminole and vacuum fields. wyoming we hold 260,000 net acres in wyoming and have almost 100 years of exploration and development in the state. we have ongoing enhanced oil recovery projects at the mature bighorn basin and wind river basin fields and initiated an additional enhanced recovery project at our 100 percent owned and operated pitchfork field in 2011. we have conventional natural gas operations in the greater green river basin and unconventional coal bed natural gas operations in the powder river basin. in 2011, we drilled 17 gross (17 net) operated development wells in wyoming, which included five wellbore re-entries and plan 3 4 gross (3 4 net) operated wells in 2012. our wyoming sales averaged 17 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 75 mmcfd of natural gas during 2011. in addition, we own and operate the 420-mile red butte pipeline. this crude oil pipeline connects silvertip station on the montana/wyoming state line to casper, wyoming. west virginia/pennsylvania in the appalachian basin we hold 82,000 net acres in the marcellus shale natural gas play in pennsylvania and west virginia. in february 2011, we entered into a joint venture on a large portion of our marcellus shale acreage position. under the agreement which ends in 2012, our joint venture partner will earn 50 percent of approximately 60,000 acres under a drilling carry and has an option to acquire our remaining acreage while we retain the rights to continue to market the acreage to others. in 2011, 2 gross (1 net) outside-operated wells were drilled with 1 gross (0.5 net) well awaiting completion. we expect to participate in 4 gross (2 net) wells in 2012. gulf of mexico production on december 31, 2011, we held material interests in seven producing fields, four of which are company-operated. we operate and have a 65 percent working interest in the ewing bank block 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of new orleans, louisiana. the platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the lobster, oyster and arnold fields on ewing bank blocks 873, 917 and 963. the facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs. we own a 50 percent working interest in the outside-operated petronius field on viosca knoll blocks 786 and 830 located 130 miles southeast of new orleans, which includes six producing wells. the petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. during 2012, we plan to acquire seismic data in order to identify future drilling opportunities. we hold a 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated neptune field located on atwater valley block 575, 120 miles off the coast of louisiana. the development includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. additional drilling and recompletion activity is being considered for 2012. we have a 100 percent operated working interest and an 81 percent net revenue interest in the droshky development located on green canyon block 244 off the coast of louisiana. this development began production in mid-july of 2010 and reached peak net production of 45 mboed in the third quarter of 2010. the field will be produced to abandonment pressures which are expected to be reached in the first half of 2012. we hold a 68 percent working interest in ozona. development of our operated ozona prospect, located on garden banks block 515, was delayed by the drilling moratorium (discussed below) and subsequent regulatory changes. in 2011, we completed the ozona well as a single zone producer tied back to a non-operated host platform. first production began in late december 2011. average net sales for 2011 from the gulf of mexico were 30 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 24 mmcfd of natural gas. we also own a 34 percent outside-operated interest in the neptune gas plant located onshore louisiana. this high efficiency gas plant, which services four high pressure offshore and onshore pipelines, has a 650 mmcfd capacity. gulf of mexico exploration we have 21 prospects, 16 of which are operated in the gulf of mexico. as a result of an explosion and significant spill from a deepwater rig in the gulf of mexico, the u.s. department of the interior issued a drilling moratorium on may 30, 2010 ( drilling moratorium ), to suspend the drilling of deepwater wells, and prohibit drilling any new deepwater wells 7 table of contents (defined as greater than 500 foot water depth). the drilling moratorium was lifted on october 12, 2010. our first exploration plan approval was received in august 2011. in 2011, we received lease extensions for 26 blocks in the gulf of mexico which had been impacted by the drilling moratorium. a successful deepwater oil discovery well was drilled on the gunflint prospect located on mississippi canyon block 948, 160 miles southeast of new orleans in 2008. we own a 15.25 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. gunflint prospect appraisal wells were subject to the drilling moratorium. drilling of the first appraisal well began in december 2011, and a second appraisal well is planned for mid-year 2012. in the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater oil discovery on the shenandoah prospect located on walker ridge block 52. we own a 10 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. the first appraisal well is planned for mid-year 2012. in march 2011, we completed our evaluation of the flying dutchman exploratory well, located on green canyon block 511. we determined that the options to develop were not viable and all well costs have been expensed. in accordance with the federal government drilling moratorium, we temporarily suspended drilling an exploratory well on the innsbruck prospect located on mississippi canyon block 993 at a depth of 19,800 feet as compared to a proposed total depth of 29,500 feet. in 2011, we received approval for our current exploration plan from the boemre. we have contracted a rig for this project and drilling is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2012. in december 2011, we assigned a 40 percent interest in the portion of mississippi canyon block 993 that includes innsbruck, in exchange for a 30 percent non-operated interest in green canyon blocks 403 and 404 in the kilchurn prospect plus reimbursement of certain well costs incurred to date on innsbruck. we now have a 45 percent working interest in innsbruck and continue to operate the prospect. the operator commenced drilling on the kilchurn prospect in december 2011. in october 2011, we received approval of an exploration plan from the boemre for the key largo prospect located on walker ridge block 578. we have a 60 percent working interest and are the operator of this prospect. drilling is expected in the second half of 2012. africa equatorial guinea we own a 63 percent operated working interest under a psc in the alba field which is offshore eg. during 2011, eg net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 38 mbbld, and net natural gas sales were 443 mmcfd. planned maintenance in eg is scheduled for a 28-day period from late first quarter through early second quarter 2012, with operations expected to be completely shut down for eight of those days. we hold a 63 percent operated working interest in the deep luba discovery on the alba block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the corona well on block d. these wells are part of our long-term lng strategy. we expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby alba field starts to decline. we also own a 52 percent interest in alba plant llc, an equity method investee that operates an onshore lpg processing plant located on bioko island. alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant. under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the lpg plant extracts secondary condensate and lpg from the natural gas stream and uses the natural gas in its operations. during 2011, a gross 890 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and 4 mbbld of secondary condensate and 11 mbbld of lpg were produced by alba plant llc. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e&amp;p segment. as part of our integrated gas segment, we own 45 percent of ampco and 60 percent of egholdings, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility, both located on bioko island. dry natural gas from the alba field, which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed by alba plant llc, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc, ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below. during 2011, a gross 127 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 668 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the lng production facility. any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the alba field for later production. libya civil unrest, which began in february 2011 in parts of north africa, escalated to armed conflict in libya where we hold a 16 percent working interest in the waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the sirte basin of eastern libya. during the first quarter 2011, all production operations in libya were suspended. in the 8 table of contents fourth quarter of 2011, limited production resumed from the waha concessions, but we made no deliveries of hydrocarbons. in january 2012, libya produced 190 gross mbbld (25 net mbbld), and sales are planned to resume in the first quarter of 2012. the return of our operations in libya to pre-conflict levels is unknown at this time; however, we and our partners in the waha concessions are assessing the condition of our assets and determining when the full resumption of operations will be viable. angola offshore angola, we hold 10 percent working interests in blocks 31 and 32, both of which are outside-operated. the discoveries on blocks 31 and 32 represent several potential development hubs. in 2008, we received approval to proceed with the first deepwater development project, called the psvm development, which includes the plutao, saturno, venus and marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well in the northeastern portion of block 31. the psvm development will utilize an fpso with a total of 48 production and injection wells. development drilling began in 2010 and first production is anticipated in mid-2012. the potential for a second development hub on this block is being evaluated. studies are underway to establish a development in the eastern part of block 32 and to assess the development potential of the other discoveries. we anticipate at least one development on block 32. europe norway we operate 10 licenses and hold interests in over 249,000 net acres on the offshore norwegian continental shelf. in 2011, net sales from norway averaged 80 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 42 mmcfd of gas. the alvheim development is comprised of the kameleon, east kameleon and kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. it is produced to the alvheim complex which consists of an fpso with subsea infrastructure. in 2011, due to debottlenecking efforts, capacity of the fpso increased to 86 mbbld net (149 mbbld gross). produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the sage system by pipeline. at the end of 2011, the alvheim development included 13 producing wells and two water disposal wells. an additional development well is planned in 2012. the nearby outside-operated vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the alvheim complex in august 2008. at the end of 2011, two wells were producing and an additional development, vilje sor had been approved. production from vilje sor is estimated to begin near the end of 2013. the volund field, five miles south of the alvheim fpso was the second subsea development tied back to the alvheim complex. the volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated working interest, consists of three production wells and one water injection well. first production from volund was announced in september 2009. it initially functioned as a swing producer to allow us to maintain full capacity on the alvheim fpso until the second quarter of 2010 when we commenced full production. drilling of an additional development well at volund is planned for fourth quarter 2012, with first production scheduled in early 2013. also offshore norway, are the boyla (formerly marihone) and viper discoveries in which we hold a 65 percent operated working interest. the boyla oil discovery is located in license pl340 about 12 miles south of the volund and alvheim fields. the viper oil discovery is located in license pl203, immediately next to the volund field in license pl150. both discoveries are being evaluated for possible tie back to the alvheim complex. an investment decision on boyla could occur in the second quarter of 2012, with first production estimated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2014. exploration activities will continue in 2012 and 2013. the velsem&oslash;y well is expected to begin drilling late in 2012 in license pl531 where we hold a 10 percent carried working interest. drilling is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2013 on the sverdrup well in license pl 330 where we hold a 30 percent operated working interest. united kingdom net sales from the u.k. averaged 21 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 55 mmcfd of natural gas. our largest asset in the u.k. sector of the north sea is the brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the south, central, north and west brae fields and a 39 percent working interest in the east brae field. the brae alpha platform and facilities host the south, central and west brae fields. the north brae field, which is produced via the brae bravo platform, and the east brae field, which is produced via the east brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. the east brae platform also hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. two development wells were completed at west brae in early 2011 and we continue to pursue brae complex projects designed to maximize natural gas recovery and maintain deliverability rates to the u.k. market. the strategic location of the brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. currently, the operators of twenty-five third-party fields are contracted to use the brae system and 73 mboed are being processed or transported through the brae infrastructure. in 2011, we installed a new module to accommodate the tie back of the third-party operated devenick field. in addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage. 9 table of contents the brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated sage system. the sage pipeline transports natural gas from the brae area, and the third-party beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. the sage terminal at st. fergus in northeast scotland processes natural gas from the sage pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. in the u.k. atlantic margin west of the shetland islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in east foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the t35 and t25 fields. the export of foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from the fpso to market. all natural gas sales are to the non-operated magnus platform for use as injection gas. an upgrade of equipment on the fpso is expected to extend the life of the fields through 2021. additionally, the planned installation of replacement flowlines should secure the long-term integrity of the subsea infrastructure, but the related downtime is expected to cause a reduction in sales volumes in 2012. average net sales from foinaven were 12 mboed in 2011. poland between december 2009 and october 2010, we acquired eleven 5-year licenses, totaling 2.3 million gross acres. in 2011, we farmed-out to two companies an aggregate 49 percent undivided interest in ten of these licenses which will be earned through drilling. as of december 31, 2011, we hold a 51 percent working interest in these 10 concessions, a 100 percent interest in the remaining concession for a total of 1.2 million net acres. we are operator under all licenses. we are in the early stages of exploring and evaluating the full potential of these holdings. we drilled, cored and logged our first vertical exploratory well in late 2011 and are evaluating the data. in addition, we expect to complete proprietary 2-d seismic acquisitions in the first quarter of 2012. we have a drilling commitment of one well per license and plan to drill 6 7 gross (3 4 net) exploration wells in 2012. canada we hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in alberta, canada, which would be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. these leases cover approximately 143,000 gross acres (52,000 net) in four project areas: namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest; birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest; ells river, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest and saleski in which we hold a 33 percent outside-operated interest. exploration on the birchwood prospect continued in the winter of 2011-2012 with a seismic program and water well drilling. approximately 100 stratigraphic test wells were drilled on the birchwood prospect in the winter of 2010-2011 providing data for the ongoing assessment of reservoir quality. we expect sanction of a pilot project in 2013. other international iraqi kurdistan region in october 2010, we acquired a position in four exploration blocks in the iraqi kurdistan region. in aggregate, these contracts provide us with access to approximately 368,000 net acres. we signed pscs for operatorship and 80 percent ownership in the harir and safen blocks northeast of erbil. the krg holds a 20 percent carried interest in these blocks. we have committed to a seismic program and to drilling one well on both hafir and safen during the initial three-year exploration period. we were assigned interests in two additional outside-operated blocks located north-northwest of erbil: atrush, in which we have a 16 percent ownership (the krg holds a 4 percent carried interest), and sarsang, in which we have a 20 percent interest (the krg holds a 5 percent carried interest). in 2011, we announced the atrush-1 discovery on the atrush block and a second discovery, the swara tika-1 well on the sarsang block. the swara tika-2, an appraisal well on the sarsang block, commenced drilling in the fourth quarter of 2011. the atrush-2, an appraisal well on the atrush block, is planned for 2012. planning is underway on extended well testing and early production systems, with first production expected in the fourth quarter of 2012. indonesia we are the operator of three exploration licenses in indonesia: the pasangkayu block with a 70 percent interest, the kumawa block with a 55 percent interest, and the bone bay block with a 55 percent interest. in 2011 and 2010, wells were drilled on the bravo and romeo prospects in the pasangkayu block. these wells were expensed as dry holes. we have notified our joint venture partner and the indonesian government that we intend to relinquish the psc on the pasangkayu block. discussions continue and we are awaiting a government response. we are evaluating the bone bay and kumawa blocks. acquisitions and dispositions as previously discussed, during 2011 we closed several acquisition transactions in the eagle ford shale play and farmed-out minority interests in our dj basin and poland acreage. also, in march 2011, we closed the sale of our outside-operated interests in the gudrun field development and the brynhild and eirin exploration areas offshore norway. in october 2011, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our equity method interests in poseidon oil pipeline company, l.l.c. and odyssey pipeline l.l.c. and certain other oil pipeline interests including the eugene island pipeline system. the transaction closed on january 3, 2012. 10 table of contents in december 2011 we sold our 25 percent interest in the stones prospect located on walker ridge block 508 to the operator. we also exchanged a 100 percent interest in atwater valley block 398 in the sandpiper prospect, for a 100 percent interest in walker ridge block 577 in the key largo prospect and a 20 percent interest in green canyon block 286 in the hypnos prospect. after this transaction, we hold a 50 percent interest in green canyon block 286 and a 100 percent interest in walker ridge block 577. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisitions and note 6 for additional information about the farm-outs and divestitures. the above discussion of the e&amp;p segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, drilling rig activity in the u.s., planned maintenance downtime, timing of reaching abandonment pressures in droshky, continued investments in alaska, timing of first production from vilje sor, boyla and kurdistan, planned acquisition of seismic data for petronius, plans to achieve first production from the psvm development on block 31 offshore angola and other possible developments, plans to resume sales in libya and the expected extension of the foinaven fields. some factors which could possibly affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. the offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. predicted planned maintenance and fpso downtime are good faith estimates and preliminary, and therefore, subject to change. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. productive and drilling wells for our e&amp;p segment, the following tables set forth gross and net productive wells and

title to our properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation. in the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. in addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international pscs or exploration licenses. the following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped exploration and production acreage

e&amp;p segment includes activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. these activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and storage of production. we balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions through what we call supply optimization, which can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments thereby optimizing transportation capacity and value and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. oil sands mining segment we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the aosp, an oil sands mining joint venture located in alberta, canada. the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils. the aosp mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray, alberta and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines. gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net to our interest) barrels of bitumen per day. as of december 31, 2011, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 216,000 gross (43,000 net) acres. the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of alberta. the upgrading assets are located at fort saskatchewan, northeast of edmonton, alberta. the five year aosp expansion 1 was completed in 2011. the jackpine mine commenced production under a phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010 and began supplying oil sands ore to the base processing facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. the upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2011 were 43 mbbld, with production of 38 mbbld. phase one of debottlenecking opportunities was approved in 2011 and potential future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain under review. current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile corridor pipeline. the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. the upgrader produces synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace. as announced in the second quarter of 2011, the governments of alberta and canada have agreed to partially fund quest ccs for 865 million canadian dollars. financing would be received over a period of 15 years, including development, construction and 10 years of operations. however, the funding is subject to conditions of achieving certain performance objectives. we expect a final investment decision on this project in 2012. the above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to quest ccs. some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include projected costs and satisfaction of remaining conditions necessary for final investment decision. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 13 table of contents reserves estimated reserve quantities the following table sets forth estimated quantities of our net proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended december 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. approximately 65 percent of our proved reserves are located in organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) countries. reserves are disclosed by continent, by country, if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil-equivalent barrel basis represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves. a geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent. north america africa europe december 31, 2011 united states canada

eagle ford shale acquisitions. also, synthetic crude oil reserves increased, primarily because of the inclusion of additional lease portions in the jackpine mine and technical and economic reevaluations at year end. the above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. the above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities. preparation of reserve estimates our estimation of economically producible volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. all estimates of reserves are made in compliance with sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x. liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group, which includes our director of corporate reserves and her staff of coordinators. reserve estimates are developed and reviewed by qualified reserve estimators ( qre ). qres are engineers or geoscientists with a minimum of a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed marathon oil qualified reserve estimator training course. the reserve coordinators review all reserve estimates for all fields with proved reserves greater than 3 mmboe at a minimum of once every three years. any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by corporate reserves group management. all other proved reserve changes must be approved by a reserve coordinator. our director of corporate reserves, who reports to our chief financial officer, has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and a master of business administration. her 37 years of experience in the industry include 26 with marathon oil. she is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the society of petroleum engineers ( spe ) oil and gas reserves committee ( ogrc ), chairing in 2008 and 2009. as a member of the ogrc, she participated in the development of the petroleum resource management system. she chaired the development of the ogrc comments on the sec proposed modernization of oil and gas reporting and was a member of the american petroleum institute ad hoc group that provided comments on the same topic. estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by glj petroleum consultants of calgary, canada, third-party consultants. their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. the engineer responsible 15 table of contents for the estimates of our oil sands mining reserves has 33 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. he is a member of spe, having served as regional director from 1998 through 2001 and is a registered practicing professional engineer in the province of alberta. audits of estimates third-party consultants are engaged to provide independent estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period for the purpose of auditing the in-house reserve estimates. we met this goal for the four-year period ended december 31, 2011. we established a tolerance level of 10 percent such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. should the third-party consultants initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. this resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. this process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2011 or 2009. there were no third-party audits performed in 2010. during 2011, netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. ( nsai ) prepared a certification of december 31, 2010 reserves for the alba field in equatorial guinea. the nsai summary report is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k. the senior members of the nsai team have over 50 years of industry experience between them, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining nsai. the team lead has a master of science in mechanical engineering and is a member of spe. the senior technical advisor has a bachelor of science degree in geophysics and is a member of the society of exploration geophysicists, the american association of petroleum geologists and the european association of geoscientists and engineers. both are licensed in the state of texas. ryder scott company ( ryder scott ) performed audits of several of our fields in 2011 and 2009. their summary report on audits performed in 2011 is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k. the team lead for ryder scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott. he has a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering, is a member of spe and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas. the corporate reserves group also performs separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with other indicators such as excessively short or long lives, performance above or below expectations or changes in economic or operating conditions. changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2011, 395 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, a decrease of 10 mmboe from december 31, 2010. the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2011: beginning of year 405 revisions of previous estimates 15 improved recovery 1 purchases of reserves in place 91 extensions, discoveries, and other additions 49 transfer to proved developed (166 ) end of year 395 significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2011 include 91 mmboe due to acreage acquisition in the eagle ford shale, 26 mmboe related to anadarko woodford shale development, 10 mmboe for development drilling in the bakken shale play and 8 mmboe for additional drilling in norway. additionally, 139 mmboe were transferred from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves due to startup of the jackpine upgrader expansion in canada. costs incurred in 2011, 2010 and 2009 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $1,107 million, $1,463 million and $792 million. projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as behind-pipe zones where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. of the 395 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2011, 34 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in equatorial guinea that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004 and is expected to be completed by 2016. performance of this field has exceeded expectations, and estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010. production is not expected to experience a natural decline from facility-limited plateau production until 2014, or possibly 2015. the timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance. 16 table of contents proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo project, located in the libyan sahara desert, were booked for the first time as proved undeveloped reserves in 2010. this project, which is anticipated to take more than five years to be developed, is being executed by the operator and encompasses a continuous drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. in 2010, an engineering firm was awarded the front-end engineering and design activities. the remoteness of the north gialo project is expected to extend the duration of project execution more than five years after the reserves were initially booked. for example, lead time for delivery of required highly specialized compressors is approximately 24 months. there are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years after their original booking. as of december 31, 2011, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2012 through 2016 are projected to be $2,023 million, $1,537 million, $1,229 million, $804 million, and $439 million. the timing of future projects and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries, timing and development costs could be different than current estimates. net production sold north america africa

(c ) production operations ceased in libya in february 2011, but fixed costs continued to be incurred. (d) our businesses in ireland and gabon were sold in 2009 and were reported as discontinued operations. integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations. also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. we hold a 60 percent interest in egholdings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. egholdings has a 3.7 mmta lng production facility on bioko island in eg. lng from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term ending in 2024. the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island, with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index, regardless of destination. this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. gross sales of lng from this production facility totaled 4.1 mmt in 2011. planned maintenance at the lng production facility is scheduled for a 30 day period from late first quarter through early second quarter 2012, with operations expected to be completely shut down for 10 of those days. in 2011, we continued discussions with the government of eg and our partners regarding a potential second lng production train on bioko island. we own a 45 percent interest in ampco, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ampco owns a methanol plant located on bioko island in equatorial guinea. feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field. gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1.04, 0.85 and 0.96 mmt in 2011, 2010 and 2009. production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the u.s. 18 table of contents we sold our 30 percent outside-operated interest in a natural gas liquefaction plant in kenai alaska in the third quarter of 2011 at which time our sales from this facility ceased. the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the planned maintenance and possible expansion of the lng production facility in equatorial guinea. factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. predicted planned maintenance and downtime are good faith estimates and preliminary, and therefore, subject to change. the foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. acquiring exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. based upon statistics compiled in the 2011 global upstream performance review published by ihs herold inc., we rank tenth among u.s.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2010 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in north america. additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices. our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices. market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. see item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, overview market conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations. environmental, health and safety matters the health, environmental, safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. our corporate health, environment, safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. these laws and regulations include the occupational safety and health act ( osha ) with respect to the protection of health and safety of employees, the clean air act ( caa ) with respect to air emissions, the federal water pollution control act (also known as the clean water act ( cwa ) with respect to water discharges, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ( cercla ) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa-90 ) with respect to oil pollution and response, the national environmental policy act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the endangered species act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, and the u.s. emergency planning and community right-to-know act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. in addition, many other states and countries in which where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters. these laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. in some cases, these 19 table of contents laws can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. based on regulatory trends, particularly with respect to the caa and its implementing regulations, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see item 3. legal proceedings and item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of environmental matters, litigation and contingencies. air in august 2011, the u.s. environmental protection agency ( u.s. epa ) published proposed new source performance standards ( nsps ) and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants ( neshap ) that will both amend existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities as well as create a new nsps for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities. if the proposed rules are finalized without substantial modification, compliance with the rules will result in an increase in costs of control, equipment and labor and require additional notification, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. the u.s. epa is required to finalize this rule by april, 2012. in july 2011, the u.s. epa finalized a federal implementation plan under the caa that includes new source review ( nsr ) regulations which apply to air emissions sources on tribal lands. this rule became effective on august 30, 2011, and requires the registration and/or pre-construction permitting of most of our facilities on tribal lands in wyoming, oklahoma and north dakota. to minimize pre-construction delays in the near term, we entered into an administrative compliance and consent agreement ( agreement ) that temporarily suspended the requirement for pre-construction permits for facilities on trial lands in north dakota as long as permit applications were filed in accordance with the agreement. we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of these permitting requirements until the u.s. epa finalizes its internal permitting procedures. the u.s. epa has indicated that this rule will be finalized during the first half of 2012. climate change in 2010, the u.s. epa promulgated rules that required us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cased promulgated. these requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate. potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors. as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. in addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state level through permitting and compliance requirements. state level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. in addition, the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. in the first quarter of 2010, the u.s. epa announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. the u.s. epa has begun preparation for the study and expects to issue an interim report in 2012 followed by a final report in 2014. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal or state laws or the 20 table of contents implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. remediation the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work. the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies. in february 2009, the alberta energy resources conservation board ( ercb ) issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. the aosp joint venture operator submitted tailings management papers to the ercb for both mines setting forth plans to comply with the directive which received approval, with conditions, in the second half of 2010. further new regulations or failure to comply in a timely manner could result in additional cost to us. concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, transactions with mpc accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. the majority of those transactions occurred while mpc was a wholly-owned subsidiary. in addition, for the years 2010 and 2009, sales of crude oil to the libyan national oil company accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. these transactions were restricted to sales of crude oil produced in libya during those periods. trademarks, patents and licenses we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. employees we had 3,322 active, full-time employees as of december 31, 2011. we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees. executive officers of the registrant the executive officers of marathon oil and their ages as

other securities filings. item 1a. risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas fluctuate widely. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are beyond our control. these factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climate; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. the long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are uncertain. lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets. 22 table of contents our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us. offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves. the proved reserve information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed, on a selected basis, by our corporate reserves group. the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2011, as well as other conditions in existence at the date. any significant future price change will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things. reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations. as a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. as required by sec rule 4-10 of regulation s-x, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended december 31, 2011, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. 23 table of contents if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and the ability to fund such activity. future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. drilling for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering; lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market-related increases in a project debt or equity financing costs; and nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors. any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. 24 table of contents we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. the specific impact of these laws and regulations may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. in addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the u.s., canada, and norway, and the european union. our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions. through 2011, domestic legislative and regulatory efforts included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. further, in december 2011 at the durban climate change conference, countries such as the u.s., china and india, and the european union agreed in principal to replace the kyoto protocol (which expires in 2012) with a new legally binding agreement. however, at this time it is not certain whether a legally binding resolution will be reached, what the terms of any agreement would be, or whether the u.s. senate would ratify such an agreement. these actions could result in increased: (1) costs to operate and maintain our facilities, (2) capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and (3) costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. these costs and capital expenditures could be material. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas) associated with any legislation, regulation, or other action by the u.s. epa, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. private party litigation has also been brought against some emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. the potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise. the u.s. epa announced in the first quarter of 2010 its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. the u.s. epa has begun preparation for the study and expects to issue an interim report in 2012 followed by a final report in 2014. in addition, various state-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs. 25 table of contents worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. a total of 64 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2011 was derived from production outside the u.s. and 64 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december 31, 2011, were located outside the u.s. all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located within or outside of the u.s. there are many risks associated with operations in countries and in global markets, such as equatorial guinea, indonesia, libya and the iraqi kurdistan region, including: changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen or synthetic crude oil pricing and taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations; political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. since january 2010, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence, within some countries in the middle east including bahrain, egypt, libya, syria, tunisia and yemen. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. if such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the u.s. these may have the following results, among others: volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products; negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted; security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel; damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations. continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. in addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the u.s. and abroad. the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk. we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. however, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. in addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs. our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or 26 table of contents other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. these same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport crude oil from our facilities. a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs. our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. as a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased. litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance. we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. if we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. in connection with our separation from mpc, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability. we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ). if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. furthermore, the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. in connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to mpc, us and our stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. 27 table of contents if, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under section 355 of the code, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin-off, mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by mpc or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes. we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements typically contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, plan, predict, target, project, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements in this report may include, but are not limited to, levels of revenues, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; levels of capital, exploration, environmental or maintenance expenditures; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, exploration or maintenance projects; volumes of production or sales of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas, and synthetic crude oil; levels of worldwide prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas; levels of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves; the acquisition or divestiture of assets; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effect of judicial proceedings on our business and financial condition; levels of common share repurchases; and the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities. part i item 1. business general marathon oil corporation was incorporated in 2001 and is an international energy company engaged in exploration and production, oil sands mining and integrated gas with operations in the united states, angola, canada, equatorial guinea, indonesia, the iraqi kurdistan region, libya, norway, poland and the united kingdom. we are based in houston, texas with our corporate headquarters at 5555 san felipe road, houston, texas 77056-2723 and a telephone number of (713) 629-6600. 3 table of contents on june 30, 2011, the spin-off of marathon downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: marathon oil and mpc. marathon shareholders at the close of business on the record date of june 27, 2011 received one share of mpc common stock for every two shares of marathon common stock held. fractional shares of mpc common stock were not distributed and any fractional share of mpc common stock otherwise issuable to a marathon shareholder was sold in the open market on such shareholder behalf, and such shareholder received a cash payment with respect to that fractional share. a private letter ruling received in june 2011 from the irs affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k, with additional information in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. income taxes we are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement the strategies and we expect to implement them in the event the forecasted conditions actually occur. assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile. our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, are expected to be realized through our future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices) and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes. the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. we consider proved and, in some cases, probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. assumptions regarding our ability to realize the u.s. federal benefit of foreign tax 49 table of contents credits are based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and our tax profile in the year that such credits may be claimed. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. we develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded u.s. pension plan and our unfunded u.s. retiree health care plan due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. in determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used are rated aa or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. the constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuance within each defined maturity group. of the assumptions used to measure the yearend obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 4.45 percent for our u.s. pension plan and 4.90 percent for our other u.s. postretirement benefit plan by 0.25 would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $43 million and $9 million and would increase annual defined benefit pension expense by $5 million and would not have a significant impact on other postretirement benefit plan expense. the asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the u.s. funded pension plan through 2011, 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent debt securities for the u.s. funded pension plan beginning in 2012 and 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent debt securities for the international funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to our historical returns for reasonableness. decreasing the 7.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense. compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices. we employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. we are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. we believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. while the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. see
