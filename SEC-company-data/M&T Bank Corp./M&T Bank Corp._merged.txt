risk factors 23-25 risk factors. m t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. as a financial institution, the company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m t common stock, in particular. 23 table of contents interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. as a result, net interest income, which represents the largest revenue source for the company, is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. the company closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change. the company makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk. possible actions to mitigate such risk include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. liquidity risk liquidity refers to the company ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. the company obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york and others. should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of funding become restricted due to disruption in the financial markets, the company ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. the company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. the company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. to mitigate such risk, the company maintains available lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of new york that are secured by loans and investment securities. on an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the company liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. credit risk factors that influence the company credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the company real estate loan portfolio and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. other factors that can influence the company credit loss experience, in addition to general economic conditions and borrowers specific abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of declining real estate values in the company portfolio of loans to residential real estate builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance associated with the company portfolio of alternative residential mortgage loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the company loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state, in general, and in the new york city metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (v) the size of the company portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types. considerable concerns exist about the economic recovery in both national and international markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit markets; federal reserve positioning of monetary policy; high unemployment, which has caused consumer spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty about possible responses to state government budget deficits. 24 table of contents numerous factors can affect the company credit loss experience. to help manage credit risk, the company maintains a detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that include members of senior management to approve significant extensions of credit. the company also maintains a credit review department that regularly reviews the company loan and lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit policy. the company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans. on a quarterly basis, the company loan review department reviews all commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 that are classified as special mention or worse. meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships. borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrower outlook, and other pertinent data. the timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the company potential courses of action are reviewed. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in management judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. in addition, the company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. any declines in value below amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are charged to earnings. economic risk the u.s. economy experienced recession and weak economic conditions during the last three years. those conditions contributed to risk as follows: the significant downturn in the residential real estate market that began in 2007 had continued in 2008 and 2009. the impact of that downturn has resulted in declining home prices, higher foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on investment securities backed by residential real estate. these factors have negatively impacted m t results of operations and could continue to do so. lower demand for the company products and services and lower revenues and earnings could result from ongoing weak economic conditions. those conditions could also result in higher loan charge-offs due to the inability of borrowers to repay loans. lower fee income from the company brokerage and trust businesses could result from significant declines in stock market prices. lower earnings could result from other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the company investment securities portfolio. higher fdic assessments could be imposed on the company due to bank failures that have caused the fdic deposit insurance fund to fall below minimum required levels. there is no assurance that the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 or the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 will improve the condition of the financial markets. supervision and regulation the company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in general, including laws related to corporate taxation. many of those laws and regulations are described in part i, item 1 business. changes in those or other laws and regulations, or the degree of the company compliance with those laws

various committees that include members of senior management to approve significant extensions of credit. the company also maintains a credit review department that regularly reviews the 22 table of contents company loan and lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit policy. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in management judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. in addition, the company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. any declines in value below amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are charged to earnings. supervision and regulation the company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in general, including laws related to corporate taxation. many of those laws and regulations are described in part i, item 1 business. changes in those or other laws and regulations, or the degree of the company compliance with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the company, could have a significant effect on the company operations and its financial results. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m t common stock, in particular. in addition, the market price of m t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory agencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 85 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 18) and capital.risk factors 22-25 risk factors. m t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. as a financial institution, the company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m t common stock, in particular. 22 table of contents interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. as a result, net interest income, which represents the largest revenue source for the company, is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. the company closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change. the company makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk. possible actions to mitigate such risk include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. liquidity risk liquidity refers to the company ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. the company obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york and others. should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of funding become restricted due to disruption in the financial markets, the company ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. the company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. the company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. to mitigate such risk, the company maintains available lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of new york that are secured by loans and investment securities. on an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the company liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. credit risk factors that influence the company credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the company real estate loan portfolio and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. other factors that can influence the company credit loss experience, in addition to general economic conditions and borrowers specific abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of declining real estate values in the company portfolio of loans to residential real estate builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance associated with the company portfolio of alternative residential mortgage loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the company loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state, in general, and in the new york city metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (v) the size of the company portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types. throughout 2008, there had been considerable concerns about the deepening economic downturn in both national and international markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit markets; federal reserve positioning of monetary policy; rising private sector layoffs and unemployment, which caused consumer spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions; and continued slowing of automobile sales. late in 2008 the u.s economy was identified as having been in recession since the fourth quarter of 2007. however, given that approximately 70% of the company loans are to customers in new york state and pennsylvania, including a large portion to customers in the 23 table of contents traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions of upstate new york and central pennsylvania, the impact of deteriorating national market conditions was not as pronounced on borrowers in these regions as compared with other areas of the country. home prices in upstate new york and central pennsylvania increased in 2008, in sharp contrast to steep declines in values in other regions of the country. therefore, despite the conditions, as previously described, the most severe credit issues experienced by the company through 2008 were centered around residential real estate, including loans to developers and builders of residential real estate in areas other than new york state and pennsylvania. in response, throughout 2008 the company conducted detailed reviews of all loans to residential real estate builders and developers that exceeded $2.5 million. those credit reviews were updated throughout the year and resulted in adjustments to loan grades and, if appropriate, commencement of intensified collection efforts, including foreclosure. with regard to residential real estate loans, with special emphasis on the portfolio of alt-a mortgage loans, the company expanded its collections and loan work-out staff and further refined its loss identification and estimation techniques by reference to loan performance and house price depreciation data in specific areas of the country where collateral that was securing the company residential real estate loans was located. all of these factors can affect the company credit loss experience. to help manage credit risk, the company maintains a detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that include members of senior management to approve significant extensions of credit. the company also maintains a credit review department that regularly reviews the company loan and lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit policy. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in management judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. in addition, the company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. any declines in value below amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are charged to earnings. economic risk the u.s. economy was in recession during 2008. as a result, several additional risk factors have been identified, as follows: the significant downturn in the residential real estate market that began in 2007 had continued in 2008. the impact of that downturn has resulted in declining home prices, higher foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on investment securities backed by residential real estate. these factors could negatively impact m t results of operations. lower demand for company products and services and lower revenues and earnings could result from an economic recession. lower fee income from the company brokerage and trust businesses could result from significant declines in stock market prices. lower earnings could result from other-than temporary impairment charges related to the company investment securities portfolio. higher fdic insurance costs due to bank failures that have caused the fdic deposit insurance fund to fall below minimum required levels. there is no assurance that the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 will improve the condition of the financial markets. supervision and regulation the company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in general, including laws related to corporate taxation. many of those laws and regulations are described in part i, item 1 business. changes in those or other laws and regulations, or the degree of the company compliance with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the company, could have a significant effect on the company operations and its financial results. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1

unemployment; the impact of economic conditions on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans in light of continued stagnant population growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty about possible responses to state and local government budget deficits. numerous factors can affect the company credit loss experience. to help manage credit risk, the company maintains a detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that include members of senior management to approve significant extensions of credit. the company also maintains a credit review department that regularly reviews the company loan and lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit policy. the company utilizes a loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans. loan grades are utilized to differentiate risk within the portfolio and consider the expectations of default for each loan. commercial loans and commercial real estate loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades and are generally ascribed lower loss factors when determining the allowance for credit losses. loans with an elevated level of credit risk are 26 table of contents classified as criticized and are ascribed a higher loss factor when determining the allowance for credit losses. criticized loans may be classified as nonaccrual if the company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. loan officers with the support of loan review personnel in different geographic locations are responsible to continuously review and reassign loan grades to pass and criticized loans based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective geographic regions. on a quarterly basis, the company centralized loan review department reviews all larger balance criticized commercial and commercial real estate loans to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade, including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing. for criticized nonaccrual loans, additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships. in analyzing criticized loans, borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrower outlook, and other pertinent data. the timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the company potential courses of action are reviewed. the collectibility of other loans is generally evaluated collectively by loan type after considering such factors as payment performance and recent loss experience and trends, which are mainly driven by current collateral values in the market place as well as the amount of loan defaults. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in management judgment appropriately reflects the losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. in addition, the company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. any declines in value below amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are charged to earnings. economic risk the u.s. economy experienced weak economic conditions during the last several years. those conditions contributed to risk as follows: the significant downturn in the residential real estate market that began in 2007 continued through the 2011 year-end. the impact of that downturn has resulted in depressed home prices, higher than historical levels of foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on investment securities backed by residential real estate. those factors have negatively impacted m&amp;t results of operations and could continue to do so. lower demand for the company products and services and lower revenues and earnings could result from ongoing weak economic conditions. those conditions could also result in higher loan charge-offs due to the inability of borrowers to repay loans. lower fee income from the company brokerage and trust businesses could result from significant declines in stock market prices. lower earnings could result from other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the company investment securities portfolio. higher fdic assessments could be imposed on the company due to bank failures that have caused the fdic deposit insurance fund to fall below minimum required levels. there is no assurance that the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 or the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 will improve the condition of the financial markets. supervision and regulation the company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in general, including laws related to corporate taxation. many of those laws and regulations are described in part i, item 1 business. changes in those or other laws and regulations, or the degree of the company compliance with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the company, could have a significant effect on the company operations and its financial results. for example, the dodd-frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states and requires federal agencies to implement many new rules. it is expected that at a minimum those new rules will result in increased costs, decreased revenues and more stringent capital and liquidity requirements. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. 27 table of contents in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory agencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 96 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 20) and capital.risk factors 25-33 risk factors. m&amp;t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. as a financial institution, the company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. 25 table of contents weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company and may continue to adversely affect the company. from late-2007 through mid-2009, the u.s. economy was in recession. although there has been gradual improvement in the u.s. economy since then, economic growth has been slow and uneven. the housing market remains weak and unemployment levels are high. local governments and some businesses are in financial difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. a slowing of improvement or a return to deteriorating business and economic conditions could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the company business: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company investment securities portfolio. a decrease in fees from the company brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. the company business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which m&amp;t has no control and which m&amp;t may not be able to anticipate adequately . as a result of the high percentage of the company assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company business and profitability and the value of the company assets and liabilities. for example: changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the interest that the company pays on liabilities, which impacts the company overall net interest income and profitability. such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the company loss rates on those assets. such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. such changes can also affect the company ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve policies also influence, to a significant extent, the company cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and 26 table of contents judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company results of operations. m&amp;t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company business activities, financial condition and results of operations. the company business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets, such as that experienced during the recent financial crisis, can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the company and its business, including adversely affecting the company financial condition and results of operations: it can affect the value or liquidity of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. it can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. it can affect m&amp;t ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company liquidity and results of operations. it can affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company services. in general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. the company regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. although many of the company businesses are national in scope, its core banking business is concentrated within the company retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, pennsylvania, maryland, delaware, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. risks relating to the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the united states, including the dodd-frank act and related regulations. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not security holders. these regulations affect the company lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. the united states government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. m&amp;t expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. m&amp;t also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. 27 table of contents many parts of the dodd-frank act are now in effect, while others depend on rules that are in an implementation stage likely to continue for several years. the law requires that regulators, some of which are new regulatory bodies created by the dodd-frank act, draft, review and approve hundreds of implementing regulations and conduct numerous studies that are likely to lead to more regulations. as such, the ultimate impact of the dodd-frank act on the company currently cannot be fully predicted. for more information about the dodd-frank act, see recent developments under part i, item i business and recent legislative developments under part ii, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. reforms, both under the dodd-frank act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, m&amp;t believes compliance with the dodd-frank act and its implementing regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit m&amp;t ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations resulting from the dodd-frank act and the rules promulgated thereunder could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. capital requirements imposed by the dodd-frank act, together with new capital and liquidity standards developed through the basel committee and adopted by the u.s. banking regulators, will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. new and evolving capital standards, both as a result of the dodd-frank act and implementation in the u.s. of new capital standards adopted by the basel committee, including the so-called basel iii capital accord, will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including m&amp;t. basel iii, when implemented by the u.s. bank regulatory agencies as proposed in a joint notice of proposed rulemaking in june 2012 and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. because implementation of the new basel iii capital and liquidity standards in the u.s., as well as any additional heightened capital or liquidity standards that may be established by the federal reserve under the dodd-frank act, remain subject to rulemaking in the u.s. and, in many cases, to extended observation and phase-in periods, the full effect of these standards on m&amp;t regulatory capital is uncertain at this time. the need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the company business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. it could also result in m&amp;t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks. in addition, the new liquidity standards could require the company to increase its holdings of unencumbered highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing the company ability to invest in longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, u.s. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. risks relating to the company business deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. 28 table of contents factors that influence the company credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the company portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. in recent years, the company has experienced historically high levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs of residential real estate-related loans, including first and junior lien mortgage loans and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. the company has also experienced higher than historical levels of nonaccrual commercial real estate loans since 2009. commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on acquired loans are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. m&amp;t believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. in those cases, the company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the company liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the company credit ratings. a downgrade in the company credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise 29 table of contents collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m&amp;t ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m&amp;t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. m&amp;t may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m&amp;t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m&amp;t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on m&amp;t stock and interest and principal on its debt. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m&amp;t banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased since the financial crisis and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1. business dividends for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m&amp;t right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary creditors. limitations on m&amp;t ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. the company is subject to operational risk. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk 30 table of contents also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. in addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the company continually and frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls which are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company reputation or foregone business opportunities. changes in accounting standards could impact the company financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements. these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company prior period financial statements. m&amp;t accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the company financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m&amp;t accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m&amp;t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m&amp;t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company own operations may prevent m&amp;t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m&amp;t has regularly considered opportunities to expand and improve its business through acquisition of other financial institutions. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. m&amp;t may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. in addition, the markets and industries in which the company and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. the company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of 31 table of contents acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. future acquisition and integration activities may require m&amp;t to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result m&amp;t may not be able to pursue other business opportunities. after completing an acquisition, the company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. for example, the company could experience higher credit losses than originally anticipated related to an acquired loan portfolio. m&amp;t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m&amp;t success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. growth in the company business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. if the company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. in june 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act requires those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with any such rules m&amp;t is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. the company information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. in addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, the company may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. the ability of the company customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. 32 table of contents the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company business involve substantial risk of legal liability. m&amp;t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies m&amp;t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m&amp;t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by the sec and law enforcement authorities. m&amp;t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory agencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 100 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 21) and capital.risk factors 24-32 risk factors. m&amp;t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. as a financial institution, the company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. 24 table of contents weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company and may adversely affect the company in the future. from late-2007 through mid-2009, the u.s. economy was in recession. although there has been gradual improvement in the u.s. economy since then, economic growth has been uneven and unemployment levels are high. a slowing of improvement or a return to deteriorating business and economic conditions could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the company business: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company investment securities portfolio. a decrease in fees from the company brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. the company business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which m&amp;t has no control and which m&amp;t may not be able to anticipate adequately . as a result of the high percentage of the company assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company business and profitability and the value of the company assets and liabilities. for example: changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the interest that the company pays on liabilities, which impacts the company overall net interest income and profitability. such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the company loss rates on those assets. such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. such changes can also affect the company ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve policies also influence, to a significant extent, the company cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from 25 table of contents various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company results of operations. m&amp;t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company business activities, financial condition and results of operations. the company business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the company and its business, including adversely affecting the company financial condition and results of operations: it can affect the value or liquidity of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. it can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. it can affect m&amp;t ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company liquidity and results of operations. it can affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company services. in general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. the company regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. although many of the company businesses are national in scope, its core banking business is concentrated within the company retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, pennsylvania, maryland, delaware, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. risks relating to the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the united states, including the dodd-frank act and related regulations. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not security holders. these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the company lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of fdic insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. 26 table of contents the united states government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. m&amp;t expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. m&amp;t also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. many parts of the dodd-frank act are now in effect, while others depend on rules that have yet to be adopted or implemented. reforms, both under the dodd-frank act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, m&amp;t believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit m&amp;t ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the u.s. banking regulators will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. new and evolving capital standards, both as a result of the dodd-frank act and implementation in the u.s. of new capital standards adopted by the basel committee, including the so-called basel iii capital accord, will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including m&amp;t. basel iii, when implemented and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. the need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the company business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. it could also result in m&amp;t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks. in addition, new liquidity standards will require the company to increase its holdings of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, u.s. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. risks relating to the company business deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. factors that influence the company credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city 27 table of contents metropolitan area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the company portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on acquired loans are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. m&amp;t believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. in those cases, the company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the company liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the company credit ratings. a downgrade in the company credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m&amp;t ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m&amp;t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 28 table of contents the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. m&amp;t may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m&amp;t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m&amp;t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on m&amp;t stock and interest and principal on its debt. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m&amp;t banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1. business dividends for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m&amp;t right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary creditors. limitations on m&amp;t ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. the company is subject to operational risk. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. in addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the company continually and frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain 29 table of contents competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls which are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company reputation or foregone business opportunities. changes in accounting standards could impact the company financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements. these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company prior period financial statements. m&amp;t accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the company financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m&amp;t accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m&amp;t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m&amp;t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company own operations may prevent m&amp;t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m&amp;t has regularly considered opportunities to expand and improve its business through acquisition of other financial institutions. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. m&amp;t may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. in addition, the markets and industries in which the company and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. the company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. future acquisition and integration activities may require m&amp;t to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result m&amp;t may not be able to pursue other business opportunities. after completing an acquisition, the company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. for example, the company could experience higher credit losses than originally anticipated related to an acquired loan portfolio. 30 table of contents m&amp;t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m&amp;t success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. growth in the company business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. if the company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act required those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with such rules m&amp;t is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. the company information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. in addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, the company may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. the ability of the company customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company business involve substantial risk of legal liability. m&amp;t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies m&amp;t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m&amp;t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of 31 table of contents regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the sec and law enforcement authorities. m&amp;t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory agencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 96 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 21) and capital.risk factors 23-32 risk factors. m&amp;t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. as a financial institution, the company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. 23 table of contents weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future. poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the company business: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company investment securities portfolio. a decrease in fees from the company brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale . the company business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately . as a result of the high percentage of the company assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company business and profitability and the value of the company assets and liabilities. for example: changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the interest that the company pays on liabilities, which impacts the company overall net interest income and profitability. such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the company loss rates on those assets. such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. such changes can also affect the company ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve policies also influence, to a significant extent, the company cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and 24 table of contents judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company results of operations. m&amp;t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company business activities, financial condition and results of operations. the company business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the company and its business, including adversely affecting the company financial condition and results of operations: it can affect the value or liquidity of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. it can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. it can affect m&amp;t ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company liquidity and results of operations. it can affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company services. in general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. the company regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. the company core banking business is largely concentrated within the company retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, pennsylvania, maryland, delaware, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. risks relating to the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the united states, including the dodd-frank act and related regulations. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not security holders. these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the company lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of fdic insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the company ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. 25 table of contents the united states government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. m&amp;t expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. m&amp;t also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. not all of the rules required or expected to be implemented under the dodd-frank act have been proposed or adopted, and certain of the rules that have been proposed or adopted under the dodd-frank act are subject to phase-in or transitional periods. reforms, both under the dodd-frank act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, m&amp;t believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit m&amp;t ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the u.s. banking regulators will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. new capital standards, both as a result of the dodd-frank act and the new u.s. basel iii-based capital rules will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including m&amp;t. the new u.s. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. the need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the company business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. it could also result in m&amp;t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks. in addition, the new u.s. final basel iii-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement that will come into effect, subject to certain phase-in requirements, in 2016 and the liquidity-related provisions of the federal reserve liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to section 165 of dodd-frank will require the company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, u.s. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. the effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on m&amp;t. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m&amp;t, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. m&amp;t resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. the regulation adopted by the federal reserve and fdic sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan components, a description of the range of specific 26 table of contents actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the company organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. to address effectively any shortcomings in the company resolution plan, the federal reserve and the fdic could require the company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. risks relating to the company business deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. factors that influence the company credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the company portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on acquired loans are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. in those cases, the company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and 27 table of contents volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the company liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the company credit ratings. a downgrade in the company credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m&amp;t ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m&amp;t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the company results of operations and competitive position. these regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. m&amp;t may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m&amp;t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m&amp;t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on 28 table of contents m&amp;t stock and interest and principal on its debt. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m&amp;t banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1. business dividends for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m&amp;t right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary creditors. limitations on m&amp;t ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. m&amp;t ability to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the federal reserve. the federal reserve recently amended its capital planning and stress testing rules to, among other things, generally limit a bank holding company ability to make quarterly capital distributions that is, dividends and share repurchases commencing april 1, 2015 if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bank holding company had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the federal reserve. under these new rules, for example, if a bank holding company issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued ( net distributions ), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. as such, m&amp;t ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock as per its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of m&amp;t control. the company is subject to operational risk. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. in addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company reputation or foregone business opportunities. changes in accounting standards could impact the company financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements. these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company prior period financial statements. 29 table of contents m&amp;t accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the company financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m&amp;t accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m&amp;t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m&amp;t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements in part ii, item 8. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company own operations may prevent m&amp;t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m&amp;t has regularly considered opportunities to expand and improve its business through acquisition of other financial institutions. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. m&amp;t may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. in addition, the markets and industries in which the company and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. the company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. future acquisition and integration activities may require m&amp;t to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result m&amp;t may not be able to pursue other business opportunities. after completing an acquisition, the company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. for example, the company could experience higher credit losses than originally anticipated related to an acquired loan portfolio. m&amp;t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m&amp;t success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. growth in the company business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. if the company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act required those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. 30 table of contents severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. the company information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. there have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. in addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, the company may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. the ability of the company customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company business involve substantial risk of legal liability. m&amp;t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies m&amp;t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m&amp;t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the sec and law enforcement authorities. the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. m&amp;t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company financial condition and results of operations. 31 table of contents m&amp;t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory agencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 95 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 21) and capital.risk factors 22-32 risk factors. m&amp;t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. as a financial institution, the company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. adverse experience with 22 table of contents these or other risks could have a material impact on the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future. poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the company business: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company investment securities portfolio. a decrease in fees from the company brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale . the company business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately . as a result of the high percentage of the company assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company business and profitability and the value of the company assets and liabilities. for example: changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the interest that the company pays on liabilities, which impacts the company overall net interest income and profitability. such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the company loss rates on those assets. such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. such changes can also affect the company ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply 23 table of contents of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve policies also influence, to a significant extent, the company cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company results of operations. m&amp;t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company business activities, financial condition and results of operations. the company business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the company and its business, including adversely affecting the company financial condition and results of operations: it can affect the value or liquidity of the company on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. it can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. it can affect m&amp;t ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company liquidity and results of operations. it can affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company services. in general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. the company regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. the company core banking business is largely concentrated within the company retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, maryland, new jersey, pennsylvania, delaware, connecticut, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. risks relating to the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the united states, including the dodd-frank act and related regulations. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. these regulations and supervisory guidance affect 24 table of contents the company lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of fdic insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the company ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. the united states government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. m&amp;t expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. m&amp;t also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. not all of the rules required or expected to be implemented under the dodd-frank act have been proposed or adopted, and certain of the rules that have been proposed or adopted under the dodd-frank act are subject to phase-in or transitional periods. reforms, both under the dodd-frank act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, m&amp;t believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit m&amp;t ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition and results of operations. new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the u.s. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. new capital standards, both as a result of the dodd-frank act and the new u.s. basel iii-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including m&amp;t. the new u.s. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. the need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the company business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. it could also result in m&amp;t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks. in addition, the new u.s. final basel iii-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the federal reserve liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to section 165 of dodd-frank require the company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. moreover, u.s. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed 25 table of contents conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. the effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on m&amp;t. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m&amp;t, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. m&amp;t resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. the regulation adopted by the federal reserve and fdic sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan components, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the company organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. to address effectively any shortcomings in the company resolution plan, the federal reserve and the fdic could require the company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. risks relating to the company business deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. factors that influence the company credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the company portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. in those cases, the company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. 26 table of contents the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the company liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the company credit ratings. a downgrade in the company credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m&amp;t ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m&amp;t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also negatively impacted the company results of operations and competitive position. these regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. 27 table of contents m&amp;t may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m&amp;t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m&amp;t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on m&amp;t stock and interest and principal on its debt. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m&amp;t banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1. business dividends for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m&amp;t right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary creditors. limitations on m&amp;t ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. m&amp;t ability to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the federal reserve. federal reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bank holding company ability to make quarterly capital distributions that is, dividends and share repurchases if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bank holding company had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the federal reserve. under these rules, for example, if a bank holding company issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued ( net distributions ), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. as such, m&amp;t ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock as per its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of m&amp;t control. the company is subject to operational risk. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. in addition, along with 28 table of contents other participants in the financial services industry, the company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company reputation or foregone business opportunities. changes in accounting standards could impact the company financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements. these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company prior period financial statements. m&amp;t accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the company financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m&amp;t accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m&amp;t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m&amp;t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements in part ii, item 8. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company own operations may prevent m&amp;t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m&amp;t has recently expanded its business through acquisition and may do so in the future. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. m&amp;t may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. in addition, the markets and industries in which the company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. the company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of 29 table of contents acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. acquisition and integration activities require m&amp;t to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result m&amp;t may not be able to pursue other business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the company. after completing an acquisition, the company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. for example, the company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity. m&amp;t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m&amp;t success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. growth in the company business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. if the company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act required those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. the company information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. there have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. in addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, the company may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. the ability of the company customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. 30 table of contents the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company business involve substantial risk of legal liability. m&amp;t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies m&amp;t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m&amp;t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the sec and law enforcement authorities. the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. m&amp;t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, 31 table of contents changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory agencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 102 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 21) and capital.risk factors 27-38 ris k factors . m&amp;t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. as a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the company's business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the company's financial instruments and m&amp;t's common stock. the company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. the following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the company. market risk weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future. poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the company's business: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company's lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company's investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company's investment securities portfolio. a decrease in fees from the company's brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. the company's business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately. as a result of the high percentage of the company's assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company's business and profitability and the value of the company's assets and liabilities. for example: changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the interest that the company pays on 27 liabilities, which impacts the company's overall net interest income and profitability. such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the company's loss rates on those assets. such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. such changes can also affect the company's ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company's results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve's policies also influence, to a significant extent, the company's cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management's assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company's results of operations. m&amp;t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company's business activities, financial condition and results of operations. the company's business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company's assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company's performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the company and its business, including adversely affecting the company's financial condition and results of operations: it can affect the value or liquidity of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. it can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. it can affect m&amp;t's ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company's liquidity and results of operations. 28 it can affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company's services. in general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. the company's regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. the company's core banking business is largely concentrated within the company's retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, maryland, new jersey, pennsylvania, delaware, connecticut, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. risks relating to compliance and the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the company's lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of fdic insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the company's ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. the u.s. government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. m&amp;t expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. m&amp;t also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company's costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. not all of the rules required or expected to be implemented under the dodd-frank act have been proposed or adopted, and certain of the rules that have been proposed or adopted under the dodd-frank act are subject to phase-in or transitional periods. reforms, both under the dodd-frank act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. although it 29 is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, m&amp;t believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit m&amp;t's ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company's businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. while the change in administration in the u.s. may ultimately lead to the modification of certain of the regulations adopted since the financial crisis, uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime may negatively impact the company's businesses, at least in the short term, even if the long-term impact of any such changes may be positive for the company's businesses. capital and liquidity standards adopted by the u.s. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. new capital standards, both as a result of the dodd-frank act and the u.s. basel iii-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including m&amp;t. the u.s. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. the need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital and liquidity levels, could limit the company's business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. it could also result in m&amp;t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets' underlying risks. in addition, the u.s. basel iii-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the federal reserve's liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to section 165 of dodd-frank require the company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company's ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. moreover, u.s. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. m&amp;t's ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the federal reserve. any decision by m&amp;t to return capital to shareholders, whether through an increase in its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program, requires the approval of the m&amp;t board of directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the federal 30 reserve's ccar process and the supervisory stress tests required under the dodd-frank act whereby m&amp;t's financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. prior to the public disclosure of a bank holding company's ccar results, the federal reserve will provide the bhc with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the bhc to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. the federal reserve may object to any capital plan in which a bank holding company's regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. in june 2016, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to m&amp;t's revised ccar capital plan. in the future, if the federal reserve objects to m&amp;t's ccar capital plan or raises concerns regarding the qualitative aspects of m&amp;t's capital planning process through its supervisory oversight of m&amp;t, it could impose restrictions on m&amp;t's ability to return capital to shareholders, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of m&amp;t. in addition, federal reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bank holding company's ability to make quarterly capital distributions that is, dividends and share repurchases if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bhc had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the federal reserve. under these rules, for example, if a bhc issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued ( net distributions ), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. as such, m&amp;t's ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of m&amp;t's control. the effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on m&amp;t. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m&amp;t, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. m&amp;t's resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. the regulation adopted by the federal reserve and fdic sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan's components, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the company's organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. to address effectively any shortcomings in the company's resolution plan, the federal reserve and the fdic could require the company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or non-bank financial company were triggered, m&amp;t could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund ( olf ). the dodd-frank act creates a new mechanism, the olf, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. the olf is administered by the fdic 31 and is based on the fdic's bank resolution model. the secretary of the u.s. treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the president of the u.s. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a two-thirds vote. liquidation proceedings will be funded by the olf, which will borrow from the u.s. treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. risk-based assessments would be made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m&amp;t. any such assessments may adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. credit risk deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. factors that influence the company's credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company's real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company's credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company's loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the company's portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management's judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management's evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or 32 the economy experiences a downturn. in those cases, the company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations. liquidity risk the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company's liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the company's liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the company's credit ratings. a downgrade in the company's credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company's ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m&amp;t's ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m&amp;t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also impacted the company's results of operations and competitive position. these regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. 33 if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company's liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. m&amp;t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m&amp;t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m&amp;t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on m&amp;t stock and interest and principal on its debt. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m&amp;t's banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1. business dividends for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m&amp;t's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary's creditors. limitations on m&amp;t's ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. strategic risk the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company's revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. some of the company's non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the company and its subsidiaries are, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. in particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies have grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company's competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. 34 operational risk the company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the company's business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company's ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. in addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company's reputation or foregone business opportunities. changes in accounting standards could impact the company's financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements. these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company's prior period financial statements. m&amp;t's accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the company's financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company's reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m&amp;t's accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company's financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company's financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and 35 contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m&amp;t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m&amp;t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements in part ii, item 8. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company's own operations may prevent m&amp;t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m&amp;t has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. m&amp;t may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. in addition, the markets and industries in which the company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. the company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. acquisition and integration activities require m&amp;t to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result m&amp;t may not be able to pursue other business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the company. after completing an acquisition, the company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. for example, the company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity. m&amp;t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m&amp;t's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. growth in the company's business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. if the company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization's incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act required those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company's performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. 36 severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company's business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company's ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. the company's information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company's customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated. information security risks for large financial institutions such as m&amp;t have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. there have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. there have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the company's systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or the company's systems. these risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other internet-based applications expands. the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company's systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company's business involve substantial risk of legal liability. m&amp;t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries' business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies 37 m&amp;t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m&amp;t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the sec and law enforcement authorities. the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. m&amp;t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company's ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company's business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company's business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company's ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company's business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company's business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company's financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company's financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts' estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory agencies. 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 109 quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 21) and capital.risk factors 27-38 ris k factors . m&amp;t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. as a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the company's business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the company's financial instruments and m&amp;t's common stock. the company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. the following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the company. market risk weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future. poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the company's business: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company's lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company's investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company's investment securities portfolio. a decrease in fees from the company's brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. the company's business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately. as a result of the high percentage of the company's assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company's business and profitability and the value of the company's assets and liabilities. for example: changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the 27 interest that the company earns on assets and the interest that the company pays on liabilities, which impacts the company's overall net interest income and profitability. such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the company's loss rates on those assets. such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. such changes can also affect the company's ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company's results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve's policies also influence, to a significant extent, the company's cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management's assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company's results of operations. in december 2017, president trump signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act which is one of the most significant overhauls to the united states federal tax code since 1986 and could have a significant impact on domestic and international tax consequences. m&amp;t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company's business activities, financial condition and results of operations. the company's business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company's assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company's performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the company and its business, including adversely affecting the company's financial condition and results of operations: it can affect the value or liquidity of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. 28 it can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. it can affect m&amp;t's ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company's liquidity and results of operations. it can affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company's services. in general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. the company's regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. the company's core banking business is largely concentrated within the company's retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, maryland, new jersey, pennsylvania, delaware, connecticut, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. risks relating to compliance and the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the company's lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of fdic insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the company's ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. the u.s. government and others have undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. m&amp;t has been subject to increased regulation of its industry as a result of certain and possible future initiatives. m&amp;t continues to expect scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. compliance with new regulations and supervisory initiatives could increase the company's costs, reduce its revenue and/or limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. 29 any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company's businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. capital and liquidity standards adopted by the u.s. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. capital standards imposed as a result of the dodd-frank act and the u.s. basel iii-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including m&amp;t. the u.s. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. the requirement to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital and liquidity levels, could limit the company's business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. it could also result in m&amp;t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets' underlying risks. in addition, the u.s. basel iii-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the federal reserve's liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to section 165 of the dodd-frank act require the company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company's ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. moreover, u.s. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, common stock share repurchases and acquisitions. m&amp;t's ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the federal reserve. any decision by m&amp;t to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of m&amp;t's board of directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the federal reserve's ccar process and the supervisory stress tests required under the dodd-frank act whereby m&amp;t's financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. prior to the public disclosure of a bhc's ccar results, the federal reserve will provide the bhc with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the bhc to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. the federal reserve may object to any capital plan in which a bhc's regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. in january 2017, the 30 federal reserve finalized a rule modifying the capital plan and stress testing rules for the 2017 cycle. the rule eliminated the qualitative component of ccar for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion, such as m&amp;t. the qualitative assessment considered factors including the comprehensiveness of a bhc's capital plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the bhc had satisfied certain supervisory matters related to its processes, analyses, controls and governance. the federal reserve will continue to evaluate these factors through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning. if the federal reserve objects to m&amp;t's capital plan, it could impose restrictions on m&amp;t's ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of m&amp;t. in june 2017, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to m&amp;t's capital plan; however, m&amp;t cannot be certain that the federal reserve will not object to future capital plans submitted through the ccar program. in addition, federal reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bhc's ability to make quarterly capital distributions dividends and common stock share repurchases if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bhc had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the federal reserve. under these rules, for example, if a bhc issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued ( net distributions ), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. as such, m&amp;t's ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of m&amp;t's control. the effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on m&amp;t. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m&amp;t, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. m&amp;t's resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. the regulation adopted by the federal reserve and fdic prescribes specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan's components, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the company's organizational structure, material entities, core business lines, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. the most recent resolution plan for m&amp;t was filed in december 2017. in addition, insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as m&amp;t bank, are required to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution's failure. m&amp;t bank submitted its most recent resolution plan in december 2015, as required. the next resolution plan for m&amp;t bank is required to be filed by july 1, 2018. to address effectively any shortcomings in the company's resolution plan, the federal reserve and the fdic could require the company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. 31 if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or non-bank financial company were triggered, m&amp;t could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund ( olf ). the dodd-frank act creates a mechanism, the olf, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. the olf is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdic's bank resolution model. the secretary of the u.s. treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the president of the u.s. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a two-thirds vote. liquidation proceedings will be funded by the olf, which will borrow from the u.s. treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m&amp;t. any such assessments may adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. credit risk deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. factors that influence the company's credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company's real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company's credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company's loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the company's portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management's judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management's evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. 32 the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. in those cases, the company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations. liquidity risk the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company's liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the company's liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the company's credit ratings. a downgrade in the company's credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company's ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m&amp;t's ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m&amp;t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. 33 recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also impacted the company's results of operations and competitive position. these regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company's liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. m&amp;t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m&amp;t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m&amp;t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on m&amp;t stock and interest and principal on its debt. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m&amp;t's banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1. business distributions for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m&amp;t's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary's creditors. limitations on m&amp;t's ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. strategic risk the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company's revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. some of the company's non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the company and its subsidiaries are, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. in particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies have grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company's competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial 34 services, with the result that the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. operational risk the company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the company's business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company's ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. in addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company's reputation or foregone business opportunities. changes in accounting standards could impact the company's financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements. these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company's prior period financial statements. m&amp;t's accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the company's financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company's reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m&amp;t's accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company's financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company's financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. 35 management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m&amp;t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m&amp;t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements in part ii, item 8. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company's own operations may prevent m&amp;t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m&amp;t has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. m&amp;t may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. in addition, the markets and industries in which the company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. the company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. acquisition and integration activities require m&amp;t to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result m&amp;t may not be able to pursue other business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the company. after completing an acquisition, the company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. for example, the company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity. m&amp;t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m&amp;t's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities and markets that the company serves is significant and the company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. growth in the company's business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. if the company is not able to hire or retain these type of individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization's incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act required those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company's performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. 36 severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company's business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company's ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. the company's information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company's customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated. information security risks for large financial institutions such as m&amp;t have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. there have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. there have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the company's systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or the company's systems. these risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other internet-based applications expands. the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company's systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company's business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. m&amp;t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries' business activities (and in some cases from the activities 37 of companies m&amp;t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m&amp;t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the sec and law enforcement authorities. the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. m&amp;t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company's ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations. m&amp;t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company's business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company's business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company's ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company's business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company's business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company's financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company's financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts' estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory agencies. 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 105 quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 20) and capital.risk factors 28-42 ris k factors . m&amp;t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. as a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the company's business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the company's financial instruments and m&amp;t's common stock. the company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. the following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the company. market risk weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future. poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have adverse effects on the company's business including: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company's lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company's investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company's investment securities portfolio or other investments. a decrease in fees from the company's brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. the company's business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately. as a result of the high percentage of the company's assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company's business and profitability and the value of the company's assets and liabilities. for example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may: affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the 28 interest that the company pays on liabilities, which impacts the company's overall net interest income and profitability. adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the company's loss rates on those assets. decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. affect the company's ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company's results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve's policies influence, to a significant extent, the company's cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management's assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company's results of operations. m&amp;t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company's business activities, financial condition and results of operations. changes in the method pursuant to which libor and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations. our floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the london interbank offered rate ( libor ), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. libor and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. in july 2017, the chief executive of the financial conduct authority ( fca ) announced that the fca intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of libor. similarly, it is not possible to predict whether libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for libor-linked financial instruments. 29 the discontinuation of libor, changes in libor or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of libor as a benchmark could result in changes to the company's risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of libor adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the company owns or has issued. a substantial portion of the company's on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2021) are indexed to libor, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. in addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks. the company's business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company's assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company's performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility may: affect the value or liquidity of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. affect m&amp;t's ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company's liquidity and results of operations. affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company's services. impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. in addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations. the company's regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. the company's core banking business is largely concentrated within the company's retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, maryland, new jersey, pennsylvania, delaware, connecticut, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. 30 risks relating to compliance and the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the company's lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of fdic insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the company's ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. in general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. in some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. in addition, enforcement matters could impact the company's supervisory and cra ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the company's activities. any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company's businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the company that have been enacted or proposed in recent months. these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. for more information on the regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see part i, item 1 business in this report. capital and liquidity standards adopted by the u.s. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. capital standards imposed as a result of the dodd-frank act (as amended by egrrcpa) and the u.s. basel iii-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including m&amp;t. the u.s. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. 31 the requirement to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital and liquidity levels, could limit the company's business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. it could also result in m&amp;t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets' underlying risks. in addition, the u.s. basel iii-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the federal reserve's liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements require the company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company's ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. moreover, u.s. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, common stock share repurchases and acquisitions. certain elements of these capital and liquidity standards may be eased in the future consistent with recently issued and anticipated proposals by the federal banking agencies following the enactment of egrrcpa. however, the ultimate timing and implementation of such relief is unclear and therefore the company expects to remain subject to these standards in the near term. m&amp;t's ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the federal reserve. any decision by m&amp;t to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of m&amp;t's board of directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the federal reserve's ccar process and the supervisory stress tests required under the dodd-frank act whereby m&amp;t's financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. prior to the public disclosure of a bhc's ccar results, the federal reserve will provide the bhc with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the bhc to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. the federal reserve may object to any capital plan in which a bhc's regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. in january 2017, the federal reserve finalized a rule modifying the capital plan and stress testing rules for the 2017 cycle. the rule eliminated the qualitative component of ccar for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion, such as m&amp;t. the qualitative assessment considered factors including the comprehensiveness of a bhc's capital plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the bhc had satisfied certain supervisory matters related to its processes, analyses, controls and governance. the federal reserve will continue to evaluate these factors through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning. if the federal reserve objects to m&amp;t's capital plan, it could impose restrictions on m&amp;t's ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of m&amp;t. in june 2018, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to m&amp;t's revised capital plan; however, m&amp;t cannot be certain that the federal reserve will not object to future capital plans. 32 in addition, federal reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bhc's ability to make quarterly capital distributions dividends and common stock share repurchases if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bhc had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the federal reserve. as such, m&amp;t's ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of m&amp;t's control. certain elements of these stress testing and capital planning requirements may be eased in the future consistent with recently issued and anticipated proposals by the federal banking agencies following the enactment of egrrcpa. however, the ultimate timing and implementation of such relief is unclear and therefore the company expects to remain subject to these standards in the near term. the effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on m&amp;t. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, such as m&amp;t, are currently required to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. m&amp;t's resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. the regulation adopted by the federal reserve and fdic prescribes specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan's components, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the company's organizational structure, material entities, core business lines, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. the most recent resolution plan for m&amp;t was filed in december 2017. in addition, insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as m&amp;t bank, are required to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution's failure. m&amp;t bank submitted its most recent resolution plan in june 2018. if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan of a bhc is not credible, and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, then the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose on the company, or on any of its subsidiaries, more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or require the divestment of certain assets or operations. if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that m&amp;t's resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate its orderly resolution under the u.s. bankruptcy code, the company could become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements or business restrictions, or have to divest certain of its assets or businesses. any such measures could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or non-bank financial company were triggered, m&amp;t could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund ( olf ). the dodd-frank act creates a mechanism, the olf, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. the olf is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdic's bank resolution model. the secretary of the u.s. treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the president of the u.s. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a two-thirds vote. liquidation proceedings will be funded by the olf, which will borrow from the u.s. treasury and 33 impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m&amp;t. any such assessments may adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. credit risk deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. factors that influence the company's credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company's real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company's credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company's loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the company's portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management's judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management's evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. in those cases, the company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. 34 the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations. liquidity risk the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company's liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. negative news about the company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the company's liquidity and funding. such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the company's credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the company' ability to access the capital markets. a downgrade in the company's credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company's ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m&amp;t's ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m&amp;t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also impacted the company's results of operations and competitive position. these regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company's liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 35 m&amp;t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m&amp;t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m&amp;t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are m&amp;t's principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m&amp;t's banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1. business distributions for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m&amp;t's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary's creditors. limitations on m&amp;t's ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock. strategic risk the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company's revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. some of the company's non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. in particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company's competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the occ's fintech charter. as a result, the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that 36 allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company's own operations may prevent m&amp;t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m&amp;t has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. m&amp;t may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. in addition, the markets and industries in which the company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. the company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. acquisition and integration activities require m&amp;t to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result m&amp;t may not be able to pursue other business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the company. after completing an acquisition, the company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. for example, the company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity. operational risk the company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the company's business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company's ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company's reputation or foregone business opportunities. m&amp;t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m&amp;t's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the company engages and markets that the company serves is significant, and the company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. growth in the company's business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. the company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the company does. if the company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. 37 the company's compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve, the occ, the fdic and other regulators. the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization's incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act required those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company's performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. the company's information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company's customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated. information security risks for large financial institutions such as m&amp;t have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. there have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. there have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the company's systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or the company's systems. these risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other internet-based applications expands. further, third parties with which the company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the company's customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the company's security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. security breaches affecting the company's customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the company or its customers, thereby increasing the company's operational costs and adversely affecting its business. the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company's systems or those of third-party service providers (or, in turn, providers to such third-party providers), 38 particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. the company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the company to liability and/or reputational damage. as new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the cybersecurity regulation of the nysdfs, are implemented, the time and resources needed for the company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. in addition, the company is increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which it operates. compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations. m&amp;t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company's business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company's business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company's ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company's business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company's business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company's business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. m&amp;t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries' business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies m&amp;t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m&amp;t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the sec and law enforcement authorities. the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. m&amp;t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the 39 amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company's ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations. business risk changes in accounting standards could impact the company's financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements. these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company's prior period financial statements. information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 26 of notes to financial statements included in part ii, item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10-k. the company's reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management's selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company's reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m&amp;t's accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company's financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company's financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m&amp;t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m&amp;t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements in part ii, item 8. 40 the company's models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information . the company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values. the models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. poorly designed, implemented, or managed models present the risk that the company's business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information. as a result, the company may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses due to these failures. also, information the company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading. decisions that regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to stockholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. the company is exposed to reputational risk . a negative public opinion of the company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the company's lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. significant harm to the company's reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the company's contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. in particular, a cyber security event impacting the company's or its customers' data could have a negative impact on the company's reputation and customer confidence in the company and its cyber security. damage to the company's reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company's business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company's ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are included within this annual report on form 10-k in part i, item 1 business, and part ii, item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, in part ii, item 7 under the heading forward-looking statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the company's financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the company's financial instruments in general, and m&amp;t common stock, in particular. 41 in addition, the market price of m&amp;t common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts' estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the fasb or other regulatory age ncies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 109 quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk. incorporated by reference to the discussion contained in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the captions liquidity, market risk, and interest rate sensitivity (including table 20) and capital.risk factors 26-39 ris k factors . m t and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. as a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the company's business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the company's financial instruments and m t's common stock. the company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. the following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the company. market risk weakness in the economy has adversely affected the company in the past and may adversely affect the company in the future. poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the company could have adverse effects on the company's business including: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company. a decrease in net interest income derived from the company's lending and deposit gathering activities. a decrease in the value of the company's investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the company's investment securities portfolio or other investments. a decrease in fees from the company's brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. potential higher fdic assessments due to the dif falling below minimum required levels. an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company. an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. the company's business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. the monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately. as a result of the high percentage of the company's assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the company's business and profitability and the value of the company's assets and liabilities. for example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may: affect the difference between the interest that the company earns on assets and the 26 interest that the company pays on liabilities, which impacts the company's overall net interest income and profitability. adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the company's loss rates on those assets. decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits. affect the company's ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the company's results of operations. the monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the federal reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the company. an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the federal reserve's policies influence, to a significant extent, the company's cost of such funding. in addition, the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions. management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management's assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company's results of operations. m t cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the company's business activities, financial condition and results of operations. the forecasted discontinuation of libor and the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace libor could adversely impact the company's business and results of operations. the company's floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the company's products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the london interbank offered rate ( libor ), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. libor and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. in july 2017, the chief executive of the financial conduct authority ( fca ) announced that the fca intends to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent panel banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of libor, such that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. similarly, it is not possible to predict whether and for how long libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what new or existing benchmark rate or rates may become accepted 27 alternatives to libor, or what the effect of any such changes in industry views or alternatives may be on the markets for libor-linked financial instruments. regulators and various financial industry groups have sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the federal reserve-sponsored alternative reference rates committee) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace libor, and publish consultations on recommended practices for transitioning away from libor, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for libor-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the secured overnight financing rate ( sofr ). sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by u.s. treasury securities, and is based on directly observable u.s. treasury-based repurchase transactions. at this time, it is still not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in the market, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. the discontinuation of libor or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of libor as a benchmark could result in changes to the company's risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of libor adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the company has issued or owns. a substantial portion of the company's on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2021) are indexed to libor, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. in addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks. the company established an enterprise-wide libor transition program in 2019. an impact assessment has been completed to identify on- and off-balance sheet exposures, systems, processes, models, customers, and employees affected by the discontinuation of libor. the company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products associated with libor to alternative reference rates. the company's business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets. as most of the company's assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the company's performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. turmoil and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the company. financial market volatility may: affect the value or liquidity of the company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. affect m t's ability to access capital markets to raise funds. inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the company's liquidity and results of operations. 28 affect the value of the assets that the company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. although the company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the company's services. impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the company engages. volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. in addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations. the company's regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint. the company's core banking business is largely concentrated within the company's retail banking office network footprint, located principally in new york, maryland, new jersey, pennsylvania, delaware, connecticut, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. therefore, the company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions. risks relating to compliance and the regulatory environment the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives. the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. these regulations and supervisory guidance affect the company's lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of fdic insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the company's ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. in general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. in some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. in addition, enforcement matters could impact the company's supervisory and cra ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the company's activities. 29 any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the company's businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the company that have been enacted or proposed in recent months. these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. for more information on the regulations to which the company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see part i, item 1 business in this report. m t may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements. bank holding companies, including m t, are subject to capital and liquidity standards imposed as a result of the dodd-frank act (as amended by egrrcpa) and the u.s. basel iii-based capital rules. for additional information, see capital requirements under part i, item 1 business. from time to time, regulators may implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. if the company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. it could also result in m t being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. in addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the federal reserve's liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the company's ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. egrrcpa, the tailoring rules and other recent rulemaking have in some cases reduced the capital or liquidity requirements applicable to m t (e.g., the company is no longer subject to any lcr requirement, and the same is expected to be true for any finalized nsfr). however, basel iv significantly revises the basel capital framework, and the impact on the company will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the u.s. with respect to firms such as m t. m t's ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the federal reserve. any decision by m t to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of m t's board of directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the federal reserve's ccar process and the supervisory stress tests required under the dodd-frank act whereby m t's financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. prior to the public disclosure of a bhc's ccar results, the federal reserve will provide the bhc with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the bhc to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. the federal reserve may object to any capital plan in which a bhc's regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements 30 throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. if the federal reserve objects to m t's capital plan, it could impose restrictions on m t's ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of m t. m t cannot be certain that the federal reserve will not object to future capital plans. in addition, federal reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bhc's ability to make quarterly capital distributions dividends and common stock share repurchases if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bhc had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the federal reserve. as such, m t's ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of m t's control. if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or non-bank financial company were triggered, m t could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund ( olf ). the dodd-frank act created a mechanism, the olf, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. the olf is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdic's bank resolution model. the secretary of the u.s. treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the president of the u.s. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a two-thirds vote. liquidation proceedings will be funded by the olf, which will borrow from the u.s. treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as m t. any such assessments may adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. credit risk deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the company. as a lender, the company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. factors that influence the company's credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the company's real estate loan portfolios. factors that can influence the company's credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the company's loan portfolio (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate and (v) the size of the company's portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. 31 commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers. the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management's judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the allowance is determined by management's evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of december 31, 2019 appropriately reflects incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. however, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover such credit losses. the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. in addition, the company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company. any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations. liquidity risk the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. the company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. the company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various federal home loan banks and the federal reserve bank of new york. the company's liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. negative news about the company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the company's liquidity and funding. such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the company's credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the 32 company's ability to access the capital markets. a downgrade in the company's credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company, could adversely affect the company's ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect m t's ability to raise capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which m t has little or no control. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the company's liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. m t relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. m t is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. m t typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. these dividends are m t's principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that m t's banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. see item 1 business, distributions for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. also, m t's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary's creditors. limitations on m t's ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock. strategic risk the financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the company's revenue and profitability. the financial services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive. the company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the u.s., globally and over the internet. some of the company's non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. in particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. the company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. these developments could result in the company's competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic 33 diversity. the company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the occ's fintech charter. as a result, the company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the company's own operations may prevent m t from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. m t has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations, including: inability to fully achieve the company's strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. issues arising during transition and integration. disruption of the company's business and diversion of management's time and attention. exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions. loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions. dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of m t common stock. payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the company's tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term. inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity). changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities. 34 operational risk the company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the company's business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure. like all businesses, the company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. the company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the company's ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. although the company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the company's reputation or foregone business opportunities. m t could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. m t's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the company engages and markets that the company serves is significant, and the company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. growth in the company's business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. the company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the company does. if the company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. the company's compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve, the occ, the fdic and other regulators. the federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization's incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. in addition, the dodd-frank act required those agencies, along with the sec, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. if as a result of complying with such rules the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the company's performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. the company's information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. the company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the company's customer relationships. while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated. 35 information security risks for large financial institutions such as m t have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. there have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. there have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. these techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. these risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other internet-based applications expands. further, third parties with which the company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the company's customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the company's security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. security breaches affecting the company's customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the company or its customers, thereby increasing the company's operational costs and adversely affecting its business. the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the company's systems or those of third-party service providers (or, in turn, providers to such third-party providers), particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. the company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the company to liability and/or reputational damage. as new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the cybersecurity regulation of the nysdfs, are implemented, the time and resources needed for the company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. in addition, the company is increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which it operates. compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations. m t relies on other companies to provide key components of the company's business infrastructure. third parties provide key components of the company's business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher 36 volumes of use could adversely affect the company's ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company's business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company's business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. additionally, the company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the company. notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors' use of common service providers. the company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. many aspects of the company's business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. m t and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries' business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies m t has acquired). in addition, from time to time, m t is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the sec and law enforcement authorities. the sec has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. m t is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the company conducts its business, or reputational harm. although the company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the legal proceedings in question. thus, the company's ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations. business risk changes in accounting standards could impact the company's financial condition and results of operations. the accounting standard setters, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the sec and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting 37 standards that govern the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements. these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. for example, accounting standards update 2016-13, measurement of credit losses on financial instruments , became effective january 1, 2020, and substantially changes the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets. the adoption of the standard has resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $132 million. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the company's prior period financial statements. information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 26 of notes to financial statements included in part ii, item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10-k. the company's reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management's selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the company's reported financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. several of m t's accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the company's financial statements. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company's financial statements are incorrect, the company may experience material losses. management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. m t has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, m t could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. for additional information, see part ii, item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, critical accounting estimates and note 1, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements in part ii, item 8. the company's models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information. the company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values. the models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. poorly designed, implemented, or managed models present the risk that the company's business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the company's reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. as a result, the company may not adequately prepare for future 38 events and may suffer losses due to these failures. also, information the company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading. decisions that regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to stockholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. the company is exposed to reputational risk . a negative public opinion of the company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the company's lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. significant harm to the company's reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the company's contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. in particular, a cyber security event impacting the company's or its customers' data could have a negative impact on the company's reputation and customer confidence in the company and its cyber security. damage to the company's reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets. additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the company's reputation. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company's business. severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company's ability to conduct business. such events could affect the stability of the company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the company to incur additional expenses. although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company. discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the company are
