risk factors 23 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently deem not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. in that event, the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. the properties we lease to kindred and brookdale senior living account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi, and because the kindred master leases and our leases with brookdale senior living are triple-net leases, we also depend on kindred and brookdale senior living to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. we cannot assure you that either kindred or brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its respective obligations under our leases, and any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by either kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. kindred and brookdale senior living have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that either kindred or brookdale 23 senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations. the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; although atria and sunrise are managers, not tenants, of our properties, adverse developments in their businesses and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. as of december 31, 2012 , atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 220 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our properties in accordance with the terms of our management agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise or atria to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, and atria or sunrise may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria and sunrise manage, but do not lease, our properties, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triple-net tenant. however, any adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors could become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements provide us with the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. in such a case, our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. if such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, are generally more limited. similarly, if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in the event of an obligor bankruptcy, we may also be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if the kindred master leases, our leases with brookdale senior living or any of our other leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new 24 tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. we could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. in addition, our ability to locate suitable replacement tenants could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses to attract suitable replacement tenants. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under those leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we are parties to long-term management agreements with each of atria and sunrise pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provide comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 220 of our seniors housing communities. substantially all of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring december 31, 2027, with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods. our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years, commencing as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012. our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our atria management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by atria in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to atria's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to atria. in addition, we may terminate most of our management agreements with atria based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. we may terminate any of our sunrise management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to sunrise's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. in addition, we may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants, also subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor our contractual rights with atria and sunrise under their respective management agreements and assess our rights and remedies. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under the atria or sunrise management agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate our management agreements with atria or sunrise for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to find another manager for the properties covered by those agreements. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors care providers would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, any such replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot provide any assurance that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis or at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as manager following termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. 25 merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the healthcare and seniors housing industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the healthcare and seniors housing industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators and managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence such tenant's, operator's or managers' business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. in certain cases involving our competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager, depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to such investment, change of control or other transaction or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account thereof. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations or information technology of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated timeframe or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquired properties and other investments or integrate acquisitions without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and healthcare assets may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and healthcare assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness. when we attempt to finance, acquire or develop these types of properties, we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors, some of whom have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business objectives and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. our ability to compete successfully for investment and acquisition opportunities is affected by many factors, including our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. further, if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities, or both, to finance future investments, acquisitions or development activity, our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including that the investment's performance will fail to meet expectations, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will underperform. real estate development projects present other risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to 26 obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant development costs prior to completion of the project. in addition to risks associated with real estate investments and development generally, healthcare properties are often highly customized and may require costly tenant-specific improvements. furthermore, investments outside the united states create legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations and foreign tax risks. if the liabilities we have assumed in connection with past acquisitions or the liabilities we assume in connection with future acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur certain liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we have assumed in connection with past acquisitions or the liabilities we assume in connection with future acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were or are not aware at the time we completed or complete the acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties, and our ability to make investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries is restricted by the terms of our existing indebtedness. our investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or non-real estate assets. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on the healthcare industry, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to attract residents and patients or expand their businesses, which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. the occupancy levels at, and revenues from, our properties depend on the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to successfully compete with other operators and managers, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers could have a more pronounced effect on us than if our investments were further diversified. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we desire or need to sell any of our properties, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at a price or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 27 we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which can hinder our growth and profitability. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing certain of our assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates that are subject to annual escalations. the annual escalations in certain of our leases are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in the consumer price index. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or the consumer price index does not increase, our growth and profitability will be hindered by these leases. our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living and mob operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or mob operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to the loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. we invest in many of our mobs and other properties, and we may invest in additional properties in the future, through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring the pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in equity or property value could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, and we may acquire title to properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs to the properties. any delay or costs incurred in repositioning the properties could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. the federal government's failure to increase its borrowing authority, scheduled reductions in federal government spending or future legislation to address the federal government's projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. the amount of debt that the federal government is permitted to incur (the debt ceiling ) is limited by statute and can be increased only by legislation adopted by the u.s. congress. the u.s. department of the treasury has indicated in public 28 statements that, without an increase or suspension of the debt ceiling beyond its current effective date of may 20, 2013, the federal government will be unable to meet all of its financial commitments. the federal government's failure to increase the debt ceiling as needed to meet its future financial commitments or a downgrade in the debt rating on u.s. government securities as a result of the uncertainty related to the debt ceiling could lead to a weakened u.s. dollar, rising interest rates and constrained access to capital, which could materially adversely affect the u.s. and global economies, increase our costs of borrowing and have a material adverse effect on us. under the budget control act, a 2% reduction in medicare payments to long-term acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities (part of $1.2 trillion of sequestration), is expected to take effect on april 1, 2013. president obama and members of the u.s. congress have proposed various spending cuts and tax reform initiatives as alternatives to sequestration. such alternatives or sequestration could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to medicare, medicaid or medicare advantage plans. any such alternative, sequestration or future federal legislation relating to deficit reduction that reduces reimbursement payments to healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement. the regulatory environment of the long-term healthcare industry has generally intensified over time both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like kindred, brookdale senior living, atria and sunrise. the extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. moreover, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. further, if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us. certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors have also continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by our tenants and operators that currently depend on medicare, medicaid or private payor reimbursement. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees whether from sequestration, alternatives to sequestration or future legislation or administrative actions could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us and have a material adverse effect on us. 29 our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority regarding major decisions, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2012 , we owned 28 mobs, 11 seniors housing communities, nine skilled nursing facilities and one hospital through consolidated joint ventures, and we had ownership interests ranging between 5% and 25% in 21 mobs, 20 seniors housing communities and 14 skilled nursing facilities through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria as of december 31, 2012 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners might have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disagreements with our joint venture partners about decisions affecting a property or the joint venture could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. by and large, assisted and independent living services are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. hence, substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. due to the significant expense associated with building new properties and the staffing and other costs of providing services, the daily resident and care fees at seniors housing communities are generally affordable only for seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable regional median. a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect the continued ability of these seniors and their families to afford the daily resident and care fees. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. termination of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. applicable regulations governing assisted living communities generally require a written lease agreement with each resident that gives the resident the right to terminate his or her lease agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. consistent with these regulations, the resident lease agreements entered into by the managers of our seniors housing communities generally allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days' notice. thus, unlike typical apartment lease agreements that have terms of one year or longer, our managers cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time. due to the terms of the lease agreements and the age of the residents, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if the affected units remain unoccupied, our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. 30 overbuilding in markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. the seniors housing and mob industries generally have limited barriers to entry, and, as a consequence, the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs could outpace demand. if development outpaces demand for those asset types in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located is unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create demand for space in our mobs, the hospitals' inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. we may not be able to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients. the success of our mob operations depends, to a large extent, on our past, current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems. we invest a significant amount of time to develop our relationships with both new and existing clients, and these relationships have helped us to secure acquisition and development opportunities, as well as other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects. if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate, or if a conflict of interest or non-compete arrangement prevents us from expanding these relationships, our ability to secure new acquisition and development opportunities or other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects could be adversely impacted and our professional reputation within the industry could be damaged. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; 31 demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, including due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. in mob development projects that we undertake on a fee-for-service basis, we generally construct properties for clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which creates additional risks such as the inability to pass on increased labor and construction material costs to our clients, development and construction delays that could give our counterparties the right to receive penalties from us, and bankruptcy or default by our contractors. we attempt to mitigate these risks by establishing certain limits on our obligations, shifting some of the risk to the general contractor or seeking other legal protections, but we cannot assure you that our mitigation efforts will be effective. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our existing lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain adequate insurance coverage on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the scope and level of insurance maintained by us and our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain or require that our tenants, operators and managers maintain the same levels of insurance coverage, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. as part of our mob development business, we provide engineering, construction and architectural services, and any design, construction or systems failures related to the properties we develop may result in substantial injury or damage to clients or third parties. injury or damage claims may arise in the ordinary course and may be asserted with respect to ongoing or completed projects. although we maintain liability insurance, if any claim results in a loss, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be adequate to cover the loss in full. if we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to make a payment for the difference and could lose our investment in, or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, the affected mob, which could have a material adverse effect on us. significant legal actions could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such pending or future litigation could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare and seniors housing providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain very high. as a result, our insurance coverage and the insurance coverage of our tenants, operators and managers might not cover all claims against us or them and might not be available to us or them at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. 32 in an effort to reduce and manage costs and for various other reasons, many companies in the healthcare industry, including some of our tenants, operators and managers, utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or programs (commonly referred to as captives ) that may provide them with less insurance coverage. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants, operators and managers of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us or, in the case of our senior living operations, our results of operations and, in either case, have a material adverse effect on us. likewise, if we decide to implement a captive self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded professional liability expenses that we incur could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to comply with the terms of their leases with us, including their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. volatility or disruption in the capital markets could prevent our counterparties from satisfying their obligations to us. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, any difficulty in accessing capital or other sources of funds experienced by our other counterparties, such as letters of credit issuers, insurance carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow agents, could prevent such counterparties from remaining viable entities or satisfying their obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. internal control over financial 33 reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. moreover, changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2012 , approximately 37.3% of our total noi (excluding amounts in discontinued operations) was derived from properties located in california (12.6%), texas (7.2%), new york (6.8%), illinois (5.4%), and massachusetts (5.3%). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased competition or decreased demand, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of 12 seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia subjects us to fluctuations in u.s. and canadian currency exchange rates, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we increase our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, we may transact business in currencies other than u.s. or canadian dollars. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2012 , we had approximately $8.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness (including capital lease obligations). the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may elect to meet our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment and development activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing certain of our assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates that are subject to annual escalations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would also increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment and development activity. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing. an increase in interest rates could also decrease the 34 amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve risk, including the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facility. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any other indebtedness of ours that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. 35 in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. such distributions will limit our liquidity to finance investments, acquisitions and new developments and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock or more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 78 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 78risk factors 23 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. as of december 31, 2013 , atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 237 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria or sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. as managers, atria and sunrise do not lease our properties, and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. our leases with brookdale senior living and kindred generate a meaningful portion of our revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. the properties we lease to brookdale senior living and kindred account for a meaningful portion of our total revenues and noi, and because our leases with brookdale senior living and the kindred master leases are triple-net leases, we depend on brookdale senior living and kindred to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living and kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living or kindred to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living or kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living and kindred have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living and kindred will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. 24 we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors could become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, federal laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we are parties to long-term management agreements with each of atria and sunrise pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 237 of our seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2013. most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring december 31, 2027, with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our atria management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by atria in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to atria's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to atria. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with atria based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. similarly, we may terminate any of our sunrise management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to sunrise's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria and sunrise. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria or sunrise management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as the manager of our seniors housing communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. 25 if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living, the kindred master leases or any of our other leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. our pursuit of investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations. an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and closing beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare 26 lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment's performance will fail to meet expectations, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will underperform. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover 27 obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living and mob operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or mob operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. increased construction in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations. the annual escalations in certain of our leases may be contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered by these leases. in addition, if 28 strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability may be limited. we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement. regulation of the long-term healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living and kindred. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could face increased costs related to healthcare regulation, such as the affordable care act, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the 29 results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us. certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. we may not be able to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients. the success of our mob operations depends, to a large extent, on our past, current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems. we invest significant amounts of time in developing our relationships with both new and existing clients, and these relationships have helped us to secure acquisition and development opportunities, as well as other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects. if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate, or if a conflict of interest or non-compete arrangement prevents us from expanding these relationships, our ability to secure new acquisition and development opportunities or other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects could be impaired and our professional reputation within the industry could be damaged. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; 30 construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, including due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. in mob development projects that we undertake on a fee-for-service basis, we generally construct properties for clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which creates additional risks such as the inability to pass on increased labor and construction material costs to our clients, development and construction delays that could give our counterparties the right to receive penalties from us, and bankruptcy or default by our contractors. we attempt to mitigate these risks by establishing certain limits on our obligations, shifting some of the risk to the general contractor or seeking other legal protections, but we cannot assure you that our mitigation efforts will be effective. in connection with these projects, we provide engineering, construction and architectural services, and any design, construction or systems failures related to the properties we develop could result in substantial injury or damage to clients or third parties. any such injury or damage claims may arise in the ordinary course and may be asserted with respect to ongoing or completed projects. although we maintain liability insurance to protect us against these claims, if any claim results in a loss, we cannot assure you that our policy limits would be adequate to cover the loss in full. if we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to fund the difference and could lose our investment in, or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, the affected mob, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2013 , we owned 27 mobs, nine seniors housing communities, six skilled nursing facilities and one hospital through consolidated joint ventures, and we had ownership interests ranging between 5% and 25% in 18 mobs, 20 seniors housing communities and 14 skilled nursing facilities through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria as of december 31, 2013 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; 31 disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. termination of resident lease agreements in our seniors housing communities could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. state regulations generally require assisted living communities to have a written lease agreement with each resident that permits the resident to terminate his or her lease for any reason on reasonable notice, unlike typical apartment lease agreements that have initial terms of one year or longer. consistent with these regulations, the managers of our seniors housing communities generally enter into resident lease agreements that allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days' notice. due to these lease termination rights and the advanced age of the residents, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if the affected units remain unoccupied, our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations 32 related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. significant legal actions could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such pending or future litigation could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. reductions in federal government spending, tax reform initiatives or other federal legislation to address the federal government's projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. president obama and members of the u.s. congress have approved or proposed various spending cuts and tax reform initiatives that have resulted or could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to medicare, medicaid or medicare advantage plans. any such existing or future federal legislation relating to deficit reduction that reduces reimbursement payments to healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on certain of our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. volatility or disruption in the capital markets could prevent our counterparties from satisfying their obligations to us. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain capital to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, any difficulty in accessing capital or other sources of funds experienced by our other counterparties, such as letters of credit issuers, insurance carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow 33 agents, could prevent those counterparties from remaining viable entities or satisfying their obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2013 , approximately 37.4% of our total noi (excluding amounts in discontinued operations) was derived from properties located in california ( 13.3% ), texas ( 7.6% ), new york ( 6.8% ), illinois ( 5.0% ), and florida ( 4.7% ). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of 12 seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia subjects us to fluctuations in u.s. and canadian currency exchange rates, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we increase our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, we may transact business in currencies other than u.s. or canadian dollars. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2013 , we had approximately $9.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. 34 in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facility. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt 35 instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the 36 shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 75 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 75risk factors 24 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. as of december 31, 2014 , atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 269 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria or sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. our leases with brookdale senior living and kindred account for a significant portion of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. the properties we lease to brookdale senior living and kindred account for a significant portion of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and noi, and because our leases with brookdale senior living and the kindred master leases are triple-net leases, we depend on brookdale senior living and kindred to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living and kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living or kindred to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living or kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our 24 properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living and kindred have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living and kindred will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, federal laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 269 of our seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2014. most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring either july 31, 2024 or december 31, 2027, with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our atria management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by atria in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to atria's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to atria. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with atria based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. similarly, we may terminate any of our sunrise management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to sunrise's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria and sunrise. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria or sunrise management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as the manager of our seniors housing 25 communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living, the kindred master leases or any of our other triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. our pursuit of investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations. an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our 26 relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. 27 as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we expect to incur substantial expenses related to our acquisition of hct. the hct acquisition was completed in january 2015. we may incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating hct's business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with ours. while we expect to incur a certain level of integration expenses, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of integration expenses. many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. as a result, the integration expenses associated with the hct acquisition could, particularly in the near term, exceed any savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses. our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded portfolio and operations following the acquisition of hct. as a result of the hct acquisition, we have an expanded portfolio and operations and likely will continue to expand operations through additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions, some of which may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and maintain other necessary internal controls. it is possible that our expansion or acquisition opportunities will not be successful. it is also possible that we will not realize expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living and mob operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational 28 risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or mob operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of properties outside the united states exposes us to different risks than those associated with our domestic properties. our current or future ownership of properties outside the united states subjects us to risks that may be different or greater than those we face with our domestic properties. these risks include, but are not limited to: challenges with respect to repatriation on foreign earnings and cash; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. increased construction in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability. we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. in certain cases, the annual escalations are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered. if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability also may be limited. we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other 29 available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. some of our loan investments are subordinated to loans held by third parties. our mezzanine loan investments are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. if a senior secured loan is foreclosed, that foreclosure would extinguish our rights in the collateral for our mezzanine loan. in order to protect our economic interest in that collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to advance funds to the senior lenders in order to cure defaults under the senior secured loans and prevent such a foreclosure. if a senior secured loan has matured or has been accelerated, then in order to protect our economic interest in the collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to purchase or pay off that senior secured loan, which could require an infusion of fresh capital as large or larger than our initial investment. our ability to sell or syndicate a mezzanine loan could be limited by transfer restrictions in the intercreditor agreement with the senior secured lenders. our ability to negotiate modifications to the mezzanine loan documents with our borrowers could be limited by restrictions on modifications in the intercreditor agreement. since mezzanine loans are typically secured by pledges of equity rather than direct liens on real estate, our mezzanine loan investments are more vulnerable than our mortgage loan investments to losses caused by competing creditor claims, unauthorized transfers, or bankruptcies. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement. regulation of the long-term healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living and kindred. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could face increased costs related to healthcare regulation, such as the affordable care act, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. 30 changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us. certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. we may not be able to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients. the success of our mob operations depends, to a large extent, on our past, current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems. we invest significant amounts of time in developing our relationships with both new and existing clients, and these relationships have helped us to secure acquisition and development opportunities, as well as other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects. if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate, or if a conflict of interest or non-compete arrangement prevents us from expanding these relationships, our ability to secure new acquisition and development opportunities or other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects could be impaired and our professional reputation within the industry could be damaged. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; 31 in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, including due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. in mob development projects that we undertake on a fee-for-service basis, we generally construct properties for clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which creates additional risks such as the inability to pass on increased labor and construction material costs to our clients, development and construction delays that could give our counterparties the right to receive penalties from us, and bankruptcy or default by our contractors. we attempt to mitigate these risks by establishing certain limits on our obligations, shifting some of the risk to the general contractor or seeking other legal protections, but we cannot assure you that our mitigation efforts will be effective. in connection with these projects, we provide engineering, construction and architectural services, and any design, construction or systems failures related to the properties we develop could result in substantial injury or damage to clients or third parties. any such injury or damage claims may arise in the ordinary course and may be asserted with respect to ongoing or completed projects. although we maintain liability insurance to protect us against these claims, if any claim results in a loss, we cannot assure you that our policy limits would be adequate to cover the loss in full. if we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to fund the difference and could lose our investment in, or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, the affected mob, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2014 , we owned 28 mobs, 15 seniors housing communities, six skilled nursing facilities and one hospital through consolidated joint ventures, and we had ownership interests ranging between 5% and 25% in 17 mobs, 20 seniors housing communities and 14 skilled nursing facilities through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria as of december 31, 2014 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and 32 we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. termination of resident lease agreements in our seniors housing communities could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. state regulations generally require assisted living communities to have a written lease agreement with each resident that permits the resident to terminate his or her lease for any reason on reasonable notice, unlike typical apartment lease agreements that have initial terms of one year or longer. consistent with these regulations, the managers of our seniors housing communities generally enter into resident lease agreements that allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days' notice. due to these lease termination rights and the advanced age of the residents, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if the affected units remain unoccupied, our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. 33 significant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. the occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. as our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers' systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. while we and our managers have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. the occurrence of a cyber incident could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our managers, compromise the confidential information of our employees or the residents in our seniors housing communities, and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. reductions in federal government spending, tax reform initiatives or other federal legislation to address the federal government's projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. president obama and members of the u.s. congress have approved or proposed various spending cuts and tax reform initiatives that have resulted or could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to medicare, medicaid or medicare advantage plans. any such existing or future federal legislation relating to deficit reduction that reduces reimbursement payments to healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on certain of our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. 34 volatility or disruption in the capital markets could prevent our counterparties from satisfying their obligations to us. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain capital to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, any difficulty in accessing capital or other financing sources experienced by our other counterparties, such as letters of credit issuers, insurance carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow agents, could prevent those counterparties from remaining viable entities or satisfying their obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2014 , approximately 37.7% of our total noi (excluding amounts in discontinued operations) was derived from properties located in california ( 13.7% ), texas ( 8.0% ), new york ( 6.8% ), illinois ( 4.7% ), and florida ( 4.5% ). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of properties in canada and the united kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between u.s. dollars and canadian dollars or the british pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, canada or the united kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2014 , we had approximately $10.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; 35 potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facility. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. 36 covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. 37 to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 76 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 76risk factors 22 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. as of december 31, 2015 , atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 268 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book 22 value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria or sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. our leases with brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent account for a significant portion of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, kindred or ardent to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. the properties we lease to brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent account for a significant portion of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and noi, and because our leases with brookdale senior living and ardent and the kindred master leases are triple-net leases, we depend on brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, kindred or ardent to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living, kindred or ardent to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, federal laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. 23 we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 268 of our seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2015 . most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring either july 31, 2024 or december 31, 2027, with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our atria management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by atria in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to atria's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to atria. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with atria based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. similarly, we may terminate any of our sunrise management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to sunrise's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria and sunrise. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria or sunrise management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as the manager of our seniors housing communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living or ardent, the kindred master leases or any of our other triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also 24 could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. market conditions, including, but not limited to, interest rates and credit spreads, the availability of credit and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. the markets in which we operate are affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but may nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. these factors include, but are not limited to: interest rates and credit spreads; the availability of credit, including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained; and the actual and perceived state of the real estate market, the market for dividend-paying stocks and public capital markets in general. in addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. deflation may result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. the predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. restricted lending practices may impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability. our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon future investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets, and we may not be successful in identifying and consummating these transactions. an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities 25 include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions, including indemnification obligations in favor of third parties, are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we 26 discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we have now, and may have in the future, certain surviving indemnification obligations in favor of third parties under the terms of acquisition agreements to which we are a party. most of these indemnification obligations will be capped as to amount and survival period, and we do not believe that these obligations will be material in the aggregate. however, there can be no assurances as to the ultimate amount of such obligations or whether such obligations will have a material adverse effect on us. our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of our hospital portfolio and operations following the acquisition of ahs. as a result of our acquisition of ahs, we entered into the general acute care hospital sector. part of our long-term business strategy involves expanding our hospital portfolio through additional acquisitions. both the asset management of our existing general acute care hospital portfolio and such additional acquisitions may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, integrate new investments into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor the operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality of our operators and leverage our relationships with ardent and other operators of hospitals. it is possible that our expansion or acquisition opportunities within the general acute care hospital sector will not be successful, which could adversely impact our growth and future results. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living operating assets and mobs expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability 27 insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or mob operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of properties outside the united states exposes us to different risks than those associated with our domestic properties. our current or future ownership of properties outside the united states subjects us to risks that may be different or greater than those we face with our domestic properties. these risks include, but are not limited to: challenges with respect to repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries in which we own properties; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. increased construction and development in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. in particular, data published by the national investment center for seniors housing &amp; care has indicated that seniors housing construction starts have been increasing and deliveries on seniors housing communities will accelerate in 2016, especially in certain geographic markets. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability. we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. in certain cases, the annual escalations are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered. if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability also may be limited. we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. 28 bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. some of our loan investments are subordinated to loans held by third parties. our mezzanine loan investments are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. if a senior secured loan is foreclosed, that foreclosure would extinguish our rights in the collateral for our mezzanine loan. in order to protect our economic interest in that collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to advance funds to the senior lenders in order to cure defaults under the senior secured loans and prevent such a foreclosure. if a senior secured loan has matured or has been accelerated, then in order to protect our economic interest in the collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to purchase or pay off that senior secured loan, which could require an infusion of fresh capital as large or larger than our initial investment. our ability to sell or syndicate a mezzanine loan could be limited by transfer restrictions in the intercreditor agreement with the senior secured lenders. our ability to negotiate modifications to the mezzanine loan documents with our borrowers could be limited by restrictions on modifications in the intercreditor agreement. since mezzanine loans are typically secured by pledges of equity rather than direct liens on real estate, our mezzanine loan investments are more vulnerable than our mortgage loan investments to losses caused by competing creditor claims, unauthorized transfers, or bankruptcies. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement. regulation of the long-term healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could face increased costs related to healthcare regulation, such as the affordable care act, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. 29 changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us. certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare (both traditional medicare and "managed" medicare/medicare advantage) and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. the healthcare industry trend away from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model towards value-based payment approaches may negatively impact certain of our tenants' revenues and profitability certain of our tenants, specifically those providers in the post-acute and general acute care hospital space, are subject to the broad trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. these value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. medicare and medicaid require healthcare facilities, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. in addition medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called never events ). many large commercial payors currently require healthcare facilities to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. recently, hhs indicated that it is particularly focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatment. examples of alternative payment models include bundled-payment arrangements. it is unclear whether such models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement. the value-based purchasing trend is not limited to the public sector. several of the nation's largest commercial payors have also expressed an intent to increase reliance on value-based reimbursement arrangements. further, many large commercial payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. we expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect the revenues and profitability of those of our tenants who are providers of healthcare services; however, if this trend significantly and adversely affects their profitability, it could in turn negatively affect their ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide healthcare services that are reimbursed by medicare, medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our healthcare facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected. controls imposed by medicare, medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization reviews, have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our healthcare facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide healthcare services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. if so, this could adversely affect these tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 30 the implementation of new patient criteria for ltacs will change the basis upon which certain of our tenants are reimbursed by medicare, which could adversely affect those tenants' revenues and profitability. as part of the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 enacted on december 26, 2013, congress adopted various legislative changes impacting ltacs. these legislative changes create new medicare criteria and payment rules for ltacs, and could have a material adverse impact on the revenues and profitability of the tenants of our ltacs. this material adverse impact could, in turn, negatively affect those tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, including due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 31 our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2015 , we owned 34 mobs, 15 seniors housing communities and one ltac through consolidated joint ventures, and we had ownership interests ranging between 5% and 25% in seven mobs, 20 seniors housing communities and 14 skilled nursing facilities through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria and a 9.9% interest in ardent as of december 31, 2015 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. a large majority of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. 32 for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. significant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. the occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. as our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers' systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. while we and our managers have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. the occurrence of a cyber incident could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our managers, compromise the confidential information of our employees or the residents in our seniors housing communities, and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. reductions in federal government spending, tax reform initiatives or other federal legislation to address the federal government's projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. president obama and members of the u.s. congress have approved or proposed various spending cuts and tax reform initiatives that have resulted or could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to medicare, medicaid or medicare advantage plans. any such existing or future federal legislation relating to deficit reduction that reduces reimbursement payments to healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on certain of our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award 33 bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2015 , approximately 37.7% of our total noi (excluding amounts in discontinued operations) was derived from properties located in california ( 14.7% ), texas ( 6.7% ), new york ( 6.0% ), illinois ( 5.5% ), and florida ( 4.8% ). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of properties in canada and the united kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between u.s. dollars and canadian dollars or the british pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, canada or the united kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. 34 risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2015 , we had approximately $11.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception 35 of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facility. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable 36 stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 76 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 76risk factors 24 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. as of december 31, 2016 , atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 266 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria or sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. our leases and other agreements with brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, kindred or ardent to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. the properties we lease and loans we make to brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi, and we depend on brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties and properties that are collateral for the loans. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, kindred or ardent to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living, kindred or ardent to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve such properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in such properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. 24 we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, federal laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 266 of our seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2016 . most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring either july 31, 2024 or december 31, 2027, with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our atria management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by atria in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to atria's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to atria. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with atria based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. similarly, we may terminate any of our sunrise management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to sunrise's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria and sunrise. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria or sunrise management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as the manager of our seniors housing communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. 25 if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living or ardent, the kindred master leases or any of our other triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. market conditions, including, but not limited to, interest rates and credit spreads, the availability of credit and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. the markets in which we operate are affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but may nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. these factors include, but are not limited to: interest rates and credit spreads; the availability of credit, including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained; and the actual and perceived state of the real estate market, the market for dividend-paying stocks and public capital markets in general. 26 in addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. deflation may result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. the predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. restricted lending practices may impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability. our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon future investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets, and we may not be successful in identifying and consummating these transactions. an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. 27 if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions, including indemnification obligations in favor of third parties, are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we have now, and may have in the future, certain surviving indemnification obligations in favor of third parties under the terms of acquisition agreements to which we are a party. most of these indemnification obligations will be capped as to amount and survival period, and we do not believe that these obligations will be material in the aggregate. however, there can be no assurances as to the ultimate amount of such obligations or whether such obligations will have a material adverse effect on us. our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of our hospital and life science portfolios and operations following the acquisition of ahs and the life sciences acquisition. as a result of our acquisition of ahs in 2015, we entered into the general acute care hospital sector. also, as a result of the life sciences acquisition in 2016, we entered into the university-affiliated life science sector. part of our long-term business strategy involves expanding our hospital and life science portfolios through additional acquisitions. both the asset management of our existing general acute care hospital and university-affiliated life science portfolios and such additional acquisitions may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, integrate new investments into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor the operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality of our operators and leverage our relationships with ardent and other operators of hospitals and wexford and other operators and developers of life science properties. it is possible that our expansion or acquisition opportunities within the general acute care hospital and life science sectors will not be successful, which could adversely impact our growth and future results. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. our tenants, operators and managers are large employers who compete for labor, making their results sensitive to changes in the labor market and/or wages and benefits offered to their employees. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels or controlling labor costs, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor costs levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry, or the competitiveness of our tenants, 28 operators and managers, or costs of labor, could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living operating assets and office assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or office operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of properties outside the united states exposes us to different risks than those associated with our domestic properties. our current or future ownership of properties outside the united states subjects us to risks that may be different or greater than those we face with our domestic properties. these risks include, but are not limited to: challenges with respect to repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries in which we own properties; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. increased construction and development in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. in particular, data published by the national investment center for seniors housing &amp; care has indicated that seniors housing construction starts have been increasing and deliveries on seniors housing communities will accelerate in 2017, especially in certain geographic markets. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability. we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. in certain cases, the annual escalations are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered. if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability also may be limited. 29 we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. some of our loan investments are subordinated to loans held by third parties. our mezzanine loan investments are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. if a senior secured loan is foreclosed, that foreclosure would extinguish our rights in the collateral for our mezzanine loan. in order to protect our economic interest in that collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to advance funds to the senior lenders in order to cure defaults under the senior secured loans and prevent such a foreclosure. if a senior secured loan has matured or has been accelerated, then in order to protect our economic interest in the collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to purchase or pay off that senior secured loan, which could require an infusion of fresh capital as large or larger than our initial investment. our ability to sell or syndicate a mezzanine loan could be limited by transfer restrictions in the intercreditor agreement with the senior secured lenders. our ability to negotiate modifications to the mezzanine loan documents with our borrowers could be limited by restrictions on modifications in the intercreditor agreement. since mezzanine loans are typically secured by pledges of equity rather than direct liens on real estate, our mezzanine loan investments are more vulnerable than our mortgage loan investments to losses caused by competing creditor claims, unauthorized transfers, or bankruptcies. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement. regulation of the healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living, kindred and ardent. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers and the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of life science products. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars 30 on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could face increased costs related to changes in healthcare regulation, such as the possible repeal of the aca by the new presidential administration and republican-controlled congress and a shift toward less comprehensive health coverage, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us. certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare (both traditional medicare and "managed" medicare/medicare advantage) and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. in addition, coverage expansions via the aca through medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges may be scaled back as the new presidential administration leads efforts to repeal and replace the aca. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. the healthcare industry trend away from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model towards value-based payment approaches may negatively impact certain of our tenants' revenues and profitability certain of our tenants, specifically those providers in the post-acute and general acute care hospital space, are subject to the broad trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. these value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. medicare and medicaid require healthcare facilities, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. in addition medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called never events ). many large commercial payors currently require healthcare facilities to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. during the obama administration, hhs focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatment. examples of alternative payment models include bundled-payment arrangements. it is unclear whether such models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement. the value-based purchasing trend is not limited to the public sector. several of the nation's largest commercial payors have also expressed an intent to increase reliance on value-based reimbursement arrangements. further, many large commercial payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. while the transition of presidential administrations and possible repeal of the aca create unpredictability, we expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect the revenues and profitability of those of our tenants who are providers of healthcare services; however, if 31 this trend significantly and adversely affects their profitability, it could in turn negatively affect their ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide healthcare services that are reimbursed by medicare, medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our healthcare facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected. controls imposed by medicare, medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization reviews, have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our healthcare facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide healthcare services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. if so, this could adversely affect these tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the implementation of new patient criteria for ltacs will change the basis upon which certain of our tenants are reimbursed by medicare, which could adversely affect those tenants' revenues and profitability. as part of the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 enacted on december 26, 2013, congress adopted various legislative changes impacting ltacs. these legislative changes create new medicare criteria and payment rules for ltacs, and could have a material adverse impact on the revenues and profitability of the tenants of our ltacs. this material adverse impact could, in turn, negatively affect those tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; 32 construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, including due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2016 , we owned 33 mobs, 13 seniors housing communities, eight life science and innovation centers and one specialty hospital through consolidated joint ventures, and we had ownership interests ranging between 5% and 25% in five mobs, 21 seniors housing communities and 13 skilled nursing facilities through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria and a 9.9% interest in ardent as of december 31, 2016 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. a large majority of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees 33 at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty. life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique risks, including the following: some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research and development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. the economic environment in recent years has significantly impacted the ability of these companies to access the capital markets and venture capital funding. in addition, state and federal government and university budgets have been negatively impacted by the recent economic environment and, as a result certain programs, including grants related to biotechnology research and development, may be at risk of being eliminated or cut back significantly. if private investors, the government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development, a tenant's business may fail. the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. the approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. furthermore, our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect our tenant's entire business and its ability to pay rent. our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws. failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition. collaborative relationships with other life science entities may be crucial to the development, manufacturing, distribution or marketing of our tenants' products. if these other entities fail to fulfill their obligations under these collaborative arrangements, our tenants' businesses will suffer. legislation to reform the u.s. healthcare system, including regulations and legislation relating to the aca, may include government intervention in product pricing and other changes that adversely affect reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products. in addition, sales of many of our tenants' marketable products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. changes in government regulations, price controls or third-party payors' reimbursement policies may reduce reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products and adversely impact our tenants' businesses. we cannot assure you that our tenants in the life science industry will be successful in their businesses. if our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own 34 captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. significant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. the occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. as our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers' systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. while we and our managers have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. the occurrence of a cyber incident could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our managers, compromise the confidential information of our employees or the residents in our seniors housing communities, and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or 35 petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2016 , approximately 36.5% of our total noi (excluding amounts in discontinued operations) was derived from properties located in california ( 13.8% ), new york ( 5.9% ), texas ( 7.0% ), illinois ( 5.3% ), and florida ( 4.5% ). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of properties in canada and the united kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between u.s. dollars and canadian dollars or the british pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, canada or the united kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2016 , we had approximately $11.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. 36 in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facility. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. covenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries' existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt 37 instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. in addition, covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all 38 voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. our use of trss is limited under the code. under the code, no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017) of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss. this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss' operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. also, our trss may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forego investments we might otherwise make. finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an arm's-length basis. we believe our arrangements with our trss are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax. the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us. the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. department of the treasury. the recent u.s. president election, coupled with a republican-controlled congress, makes tax reform more likely in the near-term. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit , the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 79 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 79risk factors 15 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us . as of december 31, 2017 , atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 273 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria or sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the 15 rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. our leases and other agreements with brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us . the properties we lease to brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi, and we depend on brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties and properties that are collateral for the loans. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve such properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in such properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. we face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third-party managers. we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators. we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants' and operators' businesses and, at any time, a tenant or operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. if that happens, the tenant or operator may fail to make its payments to us when due. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches. a downturn in any of our tenants' or operators' businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes, which may be largely outside of its control. bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or, at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith. for example, we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing. a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in increased costs to the operator and significant management distraction. if we are unable to transition affected properties, they could experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency 16 proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us. these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed . we are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 273 of our seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2017 . most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring either july 31, 2024 or december 31, 2027, with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our atria management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by atria in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to atria's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to atria. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with atria based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. similarly, we may terminate any of our sunrise management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to sunrise's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria and sunrise. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria or sunrise management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as the manager of our seniors housing communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us . we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living or ardent, the kindred master leases or any of our other triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 17 in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. market conditions, including, but not limited to, interest rates and credit spreads, the availability of credit and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. the markets in which we operate are affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but may nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. these factors include, but are not limited to: interest rates and credit spreads; the availability of credit, including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained; and the actual and perceived state of the real estate market, the market for dividend-paying stocks and public capital markets in general. in addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. deflation may result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. the predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. restricted lending practices may impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability. our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon future investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets, and we may not be successful in identifying and consummating these transactions . an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our 18 relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions, including indemnification obligations in favor of third parties, are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. 19 as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we have now, and may have in the future, certain surviving indemnification obligations in favor of third parties under the terms of acquisition agreements to which we are a party. most of these indemnification obligations will be capped as to amount and survival period, and we do not believe that these obligations will be material in the aggregate. however, there can be no assurances as to the ultimate amount of such obligations or whether such obligations will have a material adverse effect on us. our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of our hospital and life science portfolios and operations following the acquisition of ahs and the life sciences acquisition. as a result of our acquisition of ardent medical services, inc. ( ahs ) in 2015, we entered into the general acute care hospital sector. also, as a result of the acquisition of substantially all of the university affiliated life science real estate assets of wexford science &amp; technology, llc ( wexford ) in 2016 (the life sciences acquisition ), we entered into the university-affiliated life science sector. part of our long-term business strategy involves expanding our hospital and life science portfolios through additional acquisitions and development of new properties. both the asset management of our existing general acute care hospital and university-affiliated life science and innovation centers portfolios and such additional acquisitions and developments may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, integrate new investments into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor the operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality of our operators and leverage our relationships with ardent and other operators of hospitals and wexford and other operators and developers of life science and innovation centers. it is possible that our expansion or acquisition opportunities within the general acute care hospital and life science sectors will not be successful, which could adversely impact our growth and future results. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. our tenants, operators and managers are large employers who compete for labor, making their results sensitive to changes in the labor market and/or wages and benefits offered to their employees. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels or controlling labor costs, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor costs levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry, or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers, or costs of labor, could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 20 our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living operating assets and office assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or office operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of properties outside the united states exposes us to different risks than those associated with our domestic properties. our current or future ownership of properties outside the united states subjects us to risks that may be different or greater than those we face with our domestic properties. these risks include, but are not limited to: challenges with respect to repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries in which we own properties; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. increased construction and development in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. data published by the national investment center for seniors housing &amp; care has indicated deliveries of new seniors housing communities will remain at elevated levels in 2018, especially in certain geographic markets. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability. we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. in certain cases, the annual escalations are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered. if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability also may be limited. we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. 21 we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. some of our loan investments are subordinated to loans held by third parties. our mezzanine loan investments are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. if a senior secured loan is foreclosed, that foreclosure would extinguish our rights in the collateral for our mezzanine loan. in order to protect our economic interest in that collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to advance funds to the senior lenders in order to cure defaults under the senior secured loans and prevent such a foreclosure. if a senior secured loan has matured or has been accelerated, then in order to protect our economic interest in the collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to purchase or pay off that senior secured loan, which could require an infusion of fresh capital as large or larger than our initial investment. our ability to sell or syndicate a mezzanine loan could be limited by transfer restrictions in the intercreditor agreement with the senior secured lenders. our ability to negotiate modifications to the mezzanine loan documents with our borrowers could be limited by restrictions on modifications in the intercreditor agreement. since mezzanine loans are typically secured by pledges of equity rather than direct liens on real estate, our mezzanine loan investments are more vulnerable than our mortgage loan investments to losses caused by competing creditor claims, unauthorized transfers, or bankruptcies. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement . regulation of the healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers and the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of life science products. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also 22 could face increased costs related to changes in healthcare regulation, such as the possible repeal of the aca by the current presidential administration and republican-controlled congress and a shift toward less comprehensive health coverage, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us . certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare (both traditional medicare and "managed" medicare/medicare advantage) and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. in addition, coverage expansions via the aca through medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges may be scaled back as the current presidential administration and some members of congress lead efforts to repeal and replace the aca. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. the healthcare industry trend away from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model towards value-based payment approaches may negatively impact certain of our tenants' revenues and profitability certain of our tenants, specifically those providers in the post-acute and general acute care hospital space, are subject to the broad trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. these value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. medicare and medicaid require healthcare facilities, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. in addition medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called never events ). many large commercial payors currently require healthcare facilities to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. during the obama administration, hhs focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatment. examples of alternative payment models include bundled-payment arrangements. it is unclear whether such models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement. the value-based purchasing trend is not limited to the public sector. several of the nation's largest commercial payors have also expressed an intent to increase reliance on value-based reimbursement arrangements. further, many large commercial payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. while the current presidential administration's and some members of congress's desire to repeal the aca creates unpredictability, we expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect the revenues and profitability of those of our tenants who are providers of healthcare services; however, if this trend significantly and adversely affects their profitability, it could in turn negatively affect their ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide healthcare services that are reimbursed by medicare, medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our healthcare facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected. controls imposed by medicare, medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization reviews, have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of 23 our healthcare facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide healthcare services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. if so, this could adversely affect these tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the implementation of new patient criteria for ltacs will change the basis upon which certain of our tenants are reimbursed by medicare, which could adversely affect those tenants' revenues and profitability. as part of the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 enacted on december 26, 2013, congress adopted various legislative changes impacting ltacs. these legislative changes create new medicare criteria and payment rules for ltacs, and could have a material adverse impact on the revenues and profitability of the tenants of our ltacs. this material adverse impact could, in turn, negatively affect those tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, due to competition from other developments; and 24 lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2017 , we owned 48 mobs, 11 life science and innovation centers, nine seniors housing communities and one irf through consolidated joint ventures, and we had 25% ownership interests in 17 seniors housing communities, 13 snfs and one mob through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria and a 9.9% interest in ardent as of december 31, 2017 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. a large majority of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty. life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique risks, including the following: some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research and development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. the economic environment in recent years has significantly impacted the ability of these companies to access the capital markets and venture capital funding. in addition, state and federal government and university budgets have been negatively impacted by the recent economic environment and, as a result certain 25 programs, including grants related to biotechnology research and development, may be at risk of being eliminated or cut back significantly. if private investors, the government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development, a tenant's business may fail. the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. the approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. furthermore, our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect our tenant's entire business and its ability to pay rent. our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws. failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition. collaborative relationships with other life science entities may be crucial to the development, manufacturing, distribution or marketing of our tenants' products. if these other entities fail to fulfill their obligations under these collaborative arrangements, our tenants' businesses will suffer. legislation to reform the u.s. healthcare system, including regulations and legislation relating to the aca, may include government intervention in product pricing and other changes that adversely affect reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products. in addition, sales of many of our tenants' marketable products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. changes in government regulations, price controls or third-party payors' reimbursement policies may reduce reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products and adversely impact our tenants' businesses. we cannot assure you that our tenants in the life science industry will be successful in their businesses. if our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations 26 related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. significant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. the occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. as our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers' systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. while we and our managers have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. the occurrence of a cyber incident could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our managers, compromise the confidential information of our employees or the residents in our seniors housing communities, and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes . under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and 27 employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2017 , approximately 35.6% of our total noi was derived from properties located in california ( 13.9% ), texas ( 6.4% ), new york ( 5.7% ), illinois ( 5.1% ) and florida ( 4.5% ). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of properties in canada and the united kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between u.s. dollars and canadian dollars or the british pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, canada or the united kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2017 , we had approximately $11.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the 28 generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy . we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. covenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries' existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. in addition, covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. 29 risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular u.s. federal corporate income tax; we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ) for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, generally including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets, a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy . the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser 30 of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. our use of trss is limited under the code. under the code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss. this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss' operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. also, our trss may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forego investments we might otherwise make. finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an arm's-length basis. we believe our arrangements with our trss are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax. the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us. the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. treasury department. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, u.s. treasury department regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit , the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit. the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the 2017 tax act ) has significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. changes made by the 2017 tax act that could affect us and our stockholders include: temporarily reducing individual u.s. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual u.s. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%; permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-u.s. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of u.s. real property interests from 35% to 21%; limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 to 80% of reit taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction); generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business's adjusted taxable income, except for taxpayers (including most equity reits) that engage in certain real estate businesses 31 and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods); and eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax. many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. the 2017 tax act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the u.s. treasury department and irs, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the 2017 tax act. in addition, it is unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the 2017 tax act may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax act as a whole will have on us. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 75 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 75risk factors 13 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. 13 risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria, sunrise and esl account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's, sunrise's or esl's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us . as of december 31, 2018 , atria, sunrise and esl, collectively, managed 334 of our consolidated seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's, sunrise's and esl's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations. we also rely on atria, sunrise and esl to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's, sunrise's and esl's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria, sunrise or esl to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria, sunrise or esl to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's, sunrise's or esl's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria, sunrise and esl manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's, sunrise's or esl's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria, sunrise or esl experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. our leases and other agreements with brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us . the properties we lease to brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi, and we depend on brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties and properties that are collateral for the loans. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve such properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in such properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. we face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third-party managers. we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators. we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants' and operators' businesses and, at any time, a tenant or operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. if that happens, the tenant or operator may fail to make its payments to us when due. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches. 14 a downturn in any of our tenants' or operators' businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes, which may be largely outside of its control. bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or, at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith. for example, we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing. a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in increased costs to the operator and significant management distraction. if we are unable to transition affected properties, they could experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us. these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria, sunrise and esl in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria, sunrise or esl if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed . we are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which atria, sunrise and esl, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 334 of our consolidated seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2018 . most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring either july 31, 2024 or december 31, 2027 , with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and most of our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our management agreement with esl has an initial term expiring january 31, 2023 , with a conditional five -year renewal period. our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our management agreements with atria, sunrise and esl upon the occurrence of an event of default by the operator in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to such operator's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to such operator. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with each atria and esl based on their failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria, sunrise and esl. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria, sunrise or esl management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria, sunrise or esl as the manager of our seniors 15 housing communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us . we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living or ardent, the kindred master leases or any of our other triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 16 market conditions, including, but not limited to, interest rates and credit spreads, the availability of credit and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. the markets in which we operate are affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but may nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. these factors include, but are not limited to: interest rates and credit spreads; the availability of credit, including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained; and the actual and perceived state of the real estate market, the market for dividend-paying stocks and public capital markets in general. in addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. deflation may result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. the predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. restricted lending practices may impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability. our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon future investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets, and we may not be successful in identifying and consummating these transactions . an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see business competition included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. 17 our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions, including indemnification obligations in favor of third parties, are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we have now, and may have in the future, certain surviving indemnification obligations in favor of third parties under the terms of acquisition agreements to which we are a party. most of these indemnification obligations will be capped as to amount and survival period, and we do not believe that these obligations will be material in the aggregate. however, there can be no assurances as to the ultimate amount of such obligations or whether such obligations will have a material adverse effect on us. 18 our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of our health system and research and innovation portfolios and operations following the acquisition of ahs and the research and innovation acquisition. as a result of our acquisition of ardent medical services, inc. ( ahs ) in 2015, we entered into the health system sector. also, as a result of the acquisition of substantially all of the university affiliated research and innovation real estate assets of wexford science &amp; technology, llc ( wexford ) in 2016 (the research and innovation acquisition ), we entered into the university-affiliated research and innovation sector. part of our long-term business strategy involves expanding our health system and research and innovation portfolios through additional acquisitions and development of new properties. both the asset management of our existing health systems and university-affiliated research and innovation centers portfolios and such additional acquisitions and developments may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, integrate new investments into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor the operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality of our operators and leverage our relationships with ardent and other operators of health systems and wexford and other operators and developers of research and innovation centers. it is possible that our expansion or acquisition opportunities within the health system and research and innovation sectors will not be successful, which could adversely impact our growth and future results. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. our tenants, operators and managers are large employers who compete for labor, making their results sensitive to changes in the labor market and/or wages and benefits offered to their employees. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels or controlling labor costs, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor costs levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry, or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers, or costs of labor, could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living operating assets and office assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or office operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 19 our ownership of properties outside the united states exposes us to different risks than those associated with our domestic properties. our current or future ownership of properties outside the united states subjects us to risks that may be different or greater than those we face with our domestic properties. these risks include, but are not limited to: challenges with respect to repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries in which we own properties; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. increased construction and development in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. data published by the national investment center for seniors housing &amp; care has indicated deliveries of new seniors housing communities will remain at elevated levels in 2019, especially in certain geographic markets. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability. we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. in certain cases, the annual escalations are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered. if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability also may be limited. we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject 20 properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. some of our loan investments are subordinated to loans held by third parties. our mezzanine loan investments are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. if a senior secured loan is foreclosed, that foreclosure would extinguish our rights in the collateral for our mezzanine loan. in order to protect our economic interest in that collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to advance funds to the senior lenders in order to cure defaults under the senior secured loans and prevent such a foreclosure. if a senior secured loan has matured or has been accelerated, then in order to protect our economic interest in the collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to purchase or pay off that senior secured loan, which could require an infusion of fresh capital as large or larger than our initial investment. our ability to sell or syndicate a mezzanine loan could be limited by transfer restrictions in the intercreditor agreement with the senior secured lenders. our ability to negotiate modifications to the mezzanine loan documents with our borrowers could be limited by restrictions on modifications in the intercreditor agreement. since mezzanine loans are typically secured by pledges of equity rather than direct liens on real estate, our mezzanine loan investments are more vulnerable than our mortgage loan investments to losses caused by competing creditor claims, unauthorized transfers, or bankruptcies. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement . regulation of the healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living, ardent, kindred and esl. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers and the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of research and innovation products. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could face increased costs related to changes in healthcare regulation, such as a shift toward less comprehensive health coverage, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. 21 changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us . certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare (both traditional medicare and "managed" medicare/medicare advantage) and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. in addition, coverage expansions via the aca through medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges may be scaled back under regulations promulgated by the current presidential administration. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. the healthcare industry trend away from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model towards value-based payment approaches may negatively impact certain of our tenants' revenues and profitability. certain of our tenants, specifically those providers in the post-acute and health system space, are subject to the broad trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. these value-based purchasing programs include public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions. these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future. we expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. for example, several of the nation's largest commercial payors are increasing reliance on value-based reimbursement arrangements. we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect the revenues and profitability of those of our tenants who are providers of healthcare services; however, if this trend significantly and adversely affects their profitability, it could in turn negatively affect their ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide healthcare services that are reimbursed by medicare, medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our healthcare facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected. controls imposed by medicare, medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization reviews, have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our healthcare facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide healthcare services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. if so, this could adversely affect these tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the implementation of new patient criteria for ltacs will change the basis upon which certain of our tenants are reimbursed by medicare, which could adversely affect those tenants' revenues and profitability. as part of the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 enacted on december 26, 2013, congress adopted various legislative changes impacting ltacs. these legislative changes create new medicare criteria and payment rules for ltacs, and could have a material adverse impact on the revenues and profitability of the tenants of our ltacs. this material adverse impact could, in turn, negatively affect those tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 22 the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may not be able to recognize rental revenue in some cases although cash rent is being paid and the lease has commenced; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 23 our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2018 , we owned 36 mobs, 12 research and innovation centers, nine seniors housing communities and one irf through consolidated joint ventures, and we had 25% ownership interests in four seniors housing communities and one mob through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria, a 34% ownership interest in esl and a 9.8% interest in ardent as of december 31, 2018 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. a large majority of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our tenants in the research and innovation industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty. research and innovation tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique risks, including the following: some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research and development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. the economic environment in recent years has significantly impacted the ability of these companies to access the capital markets and venture capital funding. in addition, state and federal government and university budgets have been negatively impacted by the recent economic environment and, as a result certain programs, including grants related to biotechnology research and development, may be at risk of being eliminated or 24 cut back significantly. if private investors, the government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development, a tenant's business may fail. the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. the approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. furthermore, our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect our tenant's entire business and its ability to pay rent. our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws. failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition. collaborative relationships with other research and innovation entities may be crucial to the development, manufacturing, distribution or marketing of our tenants' products. if these other entities fail to fulfill their obligations under these collaborative arrangements, our tenants' businesses will suffer. legislation to reform the u.s. healthcare system, including regulations and legislation relating to the aca, may include government intervention in product pricing and other changes that adversely affect reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products. in addition, sales of many of our tenants' marketable products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. changes in government regulations, price controls or third-party payors' reimbursement policies may reduce reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products and adversely impact our tenants' businesses. we cannot assure you that our tenants in the research and innovation industry will be successful in their businesses. if our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations 25 related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change could result in losses to the company. certain of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by catastrophic weather and other natural events, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms or hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our or our tenants', operators' and managers' property insurance coverage. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable. to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue. significant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. the occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. as our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers' systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. while we and our managers have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. the occurrence of a cyber incident could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our managers, compromise the confidential information of our employees or the residents in our seniors housing communities, and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our 26 operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes . under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2018 , approximately 36.2% of our total noi was derived from properties located in california ( 14.0% ), texas ( 6.4% ), new york ( 6.1% ), illinois ( 5.1% ) and florida ( 4.6% ). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of properties in canada and the united kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between u.s. dollars and canadian dollars or the british pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, canada or the united kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. 27 risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2018 , we had approximately $10.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may affect our financial results. libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor rates after 2021, and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve. if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future debt obligations may be adversely affected. 28 limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy . we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. covenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries' existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. in addition, covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular u.s. federal corporate income tax; we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 29 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ) for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, generally including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets, a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy . the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. our use of trss is limited under the code. under the code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss. this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss' operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. also, our trss may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an arm's-length basis. we believe our arrangements with our trss are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax. 30 the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us. the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. treasury department. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, u.s. treasury department regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit , the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit. the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the 2017 tax act ) significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. changes made by the 2017 tax act that could affect us and our stockholders include: temporarily reducing individual u.s. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual u.s. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%; permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-u.s. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of u.s. real property interests from 35% to 21%; limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 to 80% of reit taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction); generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business's adjusted taxable income, except for taxpayers (including most equity reits) that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods); and eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax. many of these changes were effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. the 2017 tax act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the u.s. treasury department and irs, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the 2017 tax act. in addition, it is unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the 2017 tax act may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax act as a whole will have on us. 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 71 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 71risk factors 13 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's and sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us . as of december 31, 2019 , atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 260 of our consolidated seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force atria or sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added 13 costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, any adverse developments in atria's and sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. our leases and other agreements with brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us . the properties we lease to brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi, and we depend on brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties and properties that are collateral for the loans. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by brookdale senior living, ardent or kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve such properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in such properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. we face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third-party managers. we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators. we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants' and operators' businesses and, at any time, a tenant or operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. if that happens, the tenant or operator may fail to make its payments to us when due. although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches. a downturn in any of our tenants' or operators' businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes, which may be largely outside of its control. bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or, at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith. for example, we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing. a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, in which case our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement, in which case our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, generally would be more limited. if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in any of these events, we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. 14 bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in increased costs to the operator and significant management distraction. if we are unable to transition affected properties, they could experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us. these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed . we are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 260 of our consolidated seniors housing communities as of december 31, 2019 . most of our management agreements with atria have terms expiring either july 31, 2024 or december 31, 2027 , with successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and most of our management agreements with sunrise have terms ranging from 25 to 30 years (which commenced as early as 2004 and as recently as 2012). our ability to terminate these long-term management agreements is limited to specific circumstances set forth in the agreements and may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties. we may terminate any of our management agreements with atria and sunrise upon the occurrence of an event of default by the operator in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to such operator's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to such operator. in addition, we may terminate our management agreements with atria based on their failure to achieve certain noi targets or upon the payment of a fee. we also may terminate most of our management agreements with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets, subject to certain rights of sunrise to make cure payments to us, and upon the occurrence of certain other events or the existence of certain other conditions. we continually monitor and assess our contractual rights and remedies under our management agreements with atria and sunrise. when determining whether to pursue any existing or future rights or remedies under those agreements, including termination rights, we consider numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in the event that we exercise our rights to terminate the atria or sunrise management agreements for any reason or such agreements are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to reposition the affected properties with another manager. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors housing operators would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, the transition to a replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all. any inability to replace, or a lengthy delay in replacing, atria or sunrise as the manager of our seniors housing communities following termination or non-renewal of the applicable management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us . we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if our leases with brookdale senior living or ardent, the kindred master leases or any of our other triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 15 in the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants' lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or management agreements or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. merger and acquisition activity or consolidation in the seniors housing and healthcare industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor's investment in, one or more of our tenants, operators or managers could have a material adverse effect on us. the seniors housing and healthcare industries have recently experienced increased consolidation, including among owners of real estate and care providers. we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors that pursue a variety of investments, which may include investments in our tenants, operators or managers. a competitor's investment in one of our tenants, operators or managers could enable our competitor to influence that tenant's, operator's or manager's business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, operator or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may have the right to consent to, or otherwise exercise rights and remedies, including termination rights, on account of, a competitor's investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, operator or manager. in deciding whether to exercise our rights and remedies, including termination rights, we assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations. in addition, in connection with any change of control of a tenant, operator or manager, the tenant's, operator's or manager's management team may change, which could lead to a change in the tenant's, operator's or manager's strategy or adversely affect the business of the tenant, operator or manager, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. market conditions, including, but not limited to, interest rates and credit spreads, the availability of credit and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. the markets in which we operate are affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but may nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. these factors include, but are not limited to: interest rates and credit spreads; the availability of credit, including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained; and the actual and perceived state of the real estate market, the market for dividend-paying stocks and public capital markets in general. in addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. deflation may result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. the predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. restricted lending practices may impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability. 16 our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon future investments in and acquisitions of, or our development or redevelopment of, seniors housing and healthcare assets, and we may not be successful in identifying and consummating these transactions . an important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities in domestic and international seniors housing and healthcare properties. our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our relationships with current and prospective clients, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. our competitors for these opportunities include other healthcare reits, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. see business competition included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and healthcare properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. investments outside the united states raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. we have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments; acquisitions and other new investments could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquisitions and investments without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. 17 if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions, including indemnification obligations in favor of third parties, are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may assume or incur liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past or future acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we have now, and may have in the future, certain surviving indemnification obligations in favor of third parties under the terms of acquisition agreements to which we are a party. most of these indemnification obligations will be capped as to amount and survival period, and we do not believe that these obligations will be material in the aggregate. however, there can be no assurances as to the ultimate amount of such obligations or whether such obligations will have a material adverse effect on us. our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expansion of our health system and research and innovation portfolios and operations following the acquisition of ahs and the research and innovation acquisition. as a result of our acquisition of ardent medical services, inc. ( ahs ) in 2015, we entered into the health system sector. also, as a result of the acquisition of substantially all of the university affiliated research and innovation real estate assets of wexford science &amp; technology, llc ( wexford ) in 2016 (the research and innovation acquisition ), we entered into the university-affiliated research and innovation sector. part of our long-term business strategy involves expanding our health system and research and innovation portfolios through additional acquisitions and development of new properties. both the asset management of our existing health systems and university-affiliated research and innovation centers portfolios and such additional acquisitions and developments may involve complex challenges. our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, integrate new investments into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor the operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality of our operators and leverage our relationships with ardent and other operators of health systems and wexford and other operators and developers of research and innovation centers. it is possible that our expansion or acquisition opportunities within the health system and research and innovation sectors will not be successful, which could adversely impact our growth and future results. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically to adverse changes in the real estate market and the seniors housing and healthcare industries than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties and are constrained by the terms of our existing indebtedness from making investments outside those industries. this investment focus exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio were to include real estate assets in other industries or assets unrelated to real estate. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on its participants, some of which may be unintended. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents and patients, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. our tenants, operators and managers are large employers who compete for labor, making their results sensitive to changes in the labor market and/or wages and benefits offered to their employees. if our tenants, operators 18 and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels or controlling labor costs, their ability to meet their respective obligations to us may be materially adversely affected. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor costs levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry, or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers, or costs of labor, could have a more pronounced effect on us than if we had investments outside the seniors housing and healthcare industries. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry or any economic weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operating assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. our senior living operating assets and office assets expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or office operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of properties outside the united states exposes us to different risks than those associated with our domestic properties. our current or future ownership of properties outside the united states subjects us to risks that may be different or greater than those we face with our domestic properties. these risks include, but are not limited to: challenges with respect to repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries in which we own properties; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. increased construction and development in the markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. limited barriers to entry in the seniors housing and mob industries could lead to the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs that outpaces demand. data published by the national investment center for seniors housing &amp; care has indicated deliveries of new seniors housing communities will remain at elevated levels in 2019, especially in certain geographic markets. if development outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 19 we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which could hinder our growth and profitability. we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. in certain cases, the annual escalations are contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in cpi, with caps and floors. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the properties subject to these leases do not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters or cpi does not increase, our growth and profitability may be hindered. if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in cpi, but the escalations under our leases are capped, our growth and profitability also may be limited. we own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. our investments in mobs and other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under mortgage or other secured loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. in response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. if a defaulting borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other available remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in addition, we may be subject to intercreditor or tri-party agreements that delay, impact, govern or limit our ability to foreclose on a lien securing a loan or otherwise delay or limit our pursuit of our rights and remedies. any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could have a material adverse effect on us. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our secured loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that we are unable to sell due to securities law restrictions or otherwise, or properties that we are unable to reposition with new tenants or operators on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. some of our loan investments are subordinated to loans held by third parties. our mezzanine loan investments are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. if a senior secured loan is foreclosed, that foreclosure would extinguish our rights in the collateral for our mezzanine loan. in order to protect our economic interest in that collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to advance funds to the senior lenders in order to cure defaults under the senior secured loans and prevent such a foreclosure. if a senior secured loan has matured or has been accelerated, then in order to protect our economic interest in the collateral, we would need to be prepared, on an expedited basis, to purchase or pay off that senior secured loan, which could require an infusion of fresh capital as large or larger than our initial investment. our ability to sell or syndicate a mezzanine loan could be limited by transfer restrictions in the intercreditor agreement with the senior secured lenders. our ability to negotiate modifications to the mezzanine loan documents with our borrowers could be limited by restrictions on modifications in the intercreditor agreement. since mezzanine loans are typically secured by pledges of equity rather than direct liens on real 20 estate, our mezzanine loan investments are more vulnerable than our mortgage loan investments to losses caused by competing creditor claims, unauthorized transfers, or bankruptcies. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement . regulation of the healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like atria, sunrise, brookdale senior living, ardent and kindred. federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers and the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of research and innovation products. in addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could face increased costs related to changes in healthcare regulation, such as a shift toward less comprehensive health coverage, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us . certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare (both traditional medicare and "managed" medicare/medicare advantage) and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. in addition, coverage expansions via the aca through medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges may be scaled back by litigation that may invalidate some or all of the aca, or waiver programs that reduce the number of people with medicaid coverage in a given state. we cannot assure you that our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. the healthcare industry trend away from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model towards value-based payment approaches may negatively impact certain of our tenants' revenues and profitability. certain of our tenants, specifically those providers in the post-acute and health system space, are subject to the broad trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. these value-based purchasing programs include public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions. these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future. 21 we expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. for example, several of the nation's largest commercial payors are increasing reliance on value-based reimbursement arrangements. we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect the revenues and profitability of those of our tenants who are providers of healthcare services; however, if this trend significantly and adversely affects their profitability, it could in turn negatively affect their ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide healthcare services that are reimbursed by medicare, medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our healthcare facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected. controls imposed by medicare, medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization reviews, have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our healthcare facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide healthcare services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. if so, this could adversely affect these tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our mobs. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our mobs, a hospital's inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. we consider and, when appropriate, invest in various development and redevelopment projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may not be able to recognize rental revenue in some cases although cash rent is being paid and the lease has commenced; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards; 22 construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs; in the case of our mob developments, hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected; demand for our project may decrease prior to completion, due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. if any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects, including projects undertaken through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments in joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2019 , we owned 35 mobs, 12 research and innovation centers, 38 seniors housing communities and one irf through consolidated joint ventures, and we had 25% ownership interests in five seniors housing communities and one mob through investments in unconsolidated entities. in addition, we had a 34% ownership interest in atria, a 34% ownership interest in eclipse senior living and a 9.8% interest in ardent as of december 31, 2019 . these joint ventures and unconsolidated entities involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. 23 events that adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. a large majority of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations, therefore, are derived from private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members. in light of the significant expense associated with building new properties and staffing and other costs of providing services, typically only seniors with income or assets that meet or exceed the comparable region median can afford the daily resident and care fees at our seniors housing communities, and a weak economy, depressed housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect their continued ability to do so. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors that have sufficient income, assets or other resources to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, the occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations of our senior living operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our tenants in the research and innovation industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty. research and innovation tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique risks, including the following: some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research and development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. the economic environment in recent years has significantly impacted the ability of these companies to access the capital markets and venture capital funding. in addition, state and federal government and university budgets have been negatively impacted by the recent economic environment and, as a result certain programs, including grants related to biotechnology research and development, may be at risk of being eliminated or cut back significantly. if private investors, the government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development, a tenant's business may fail. the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. the approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. furthermore, our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect our tenant's entire business and its ability to pay rent. our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws. failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition. collaborative relationships with other research and innovation entities may be crucial to the development, manufacturing, distribution or marketing of our tenants' products. if these other entities fail to fulfill their obligations under these collaborative arrangements, our tenants' businesses will suffer. legislation to reform the u.s. healthcare system, including regulations and legislation relating to the aca, may include government intervention in product pricing and other changes that adversely affect reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products. in addition, sales of many of our tenants' marketable products are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. changes in government regulations, price controls or third-party payors' reimbursement policies may reduce reimbursement for our tenants' marketable products and adversely impact our tenants' businesses. we cannot assure you that our tenants in the research and innovation industry will be successful in their businesses. if our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance provided by our policies and required to be maintained by our tenants, operators and managers and believe 24 the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators and managers will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. for various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants and operators of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. if we or the managers of our senior living operations decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change could result in losses to the company. certain of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by catastrophic weather and other natural events, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms or hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our or our tenants', operators' and managers' property insurance coverage. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable. to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue. the decision of the united kingdom to exit the european union could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in 2019, we derived 1.3% of our noi from the united kingdom. the decision made in the british referendum of june 23, 2016 to leave the european union, commonly referred to as brexit, has led to volatility in the financial markets of the united kingdom (the u.k. ), and more broadly across europe and may also lead to weakening in consumer, corporate and financial confidence in such markets. the u.k. government initiated the official eu withdrawal process on march 29, 2017, and the exit from the eu was expected to occur by the end of march 2019. however, the withdrawal was extended several times due to deadlock in negotiations. on january 29, 2020, the u.k. parliament approved a withdrawal agreement submitted on january 22, 2020, and the u.k. officially withdrew from the eu on january 31, 2020. there is a transition period through december 2020, with an option to extend an additional one to two years, to allow for businesses and individuals to adjust to its 25 changes, during which all eu regulations will continue to apply to the u.k. trade negotiations are expected to begin in early march 2020, but the nature of the economic relationship between the eu and u.k. remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that both parties will be able to reach an agreement before the transition period expires. this brexit decision has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the u.k. and the eu, and this uncertainty may last for years. our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the u.k. referendum. in addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the u.k. and other countries, including the u.s., and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the u.k. these possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the u.k.'s withdrawal from the eu, could adversely affect our and our tenants' businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. significant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against seniors housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. as a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. the occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. as our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers' systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. while we and our managers have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. the occurrence of a cyber incident could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our managers, compromise the confidential information of our employees or the residents in our seniors housing communities, and/or damage our business relationships and reputation. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes . under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we generally have indemnification rights against the current operators of our properties for contamination 26 caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic locations to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2019 , approximately 34.8% of our total noi was derived from properties located in california ( 13.8% ), new york ( 6.4% ), texas ( 5.9% ), illinois ( 4.6% ) and pennsylvania ( 4.1% ). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of properties in canada and the united kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between u.s. dollars and canadian dollars or the british pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, canada or the united kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2019 , we had approximately $12.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and 27 potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. these increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. an increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may affect our financial results. libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor rates after 2021, and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve. while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor, the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of u.s. financial market participants, selected the secured overnight finance rate ( sofr ) as an alternative to libor. sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight u.s. treasury repo market, and the federal reserve bank of new york started to publish the sofr in may 2018. at this time, it is impossible to predict whether the sofr or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to libor. the discontinuation, reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets, and could have an adverse effect on libor-based interest rates on our current or future debt obligations. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy . we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we believe that we have sufficient access to capital and other sources of funding to meet our expected liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operation and financial condition. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we 28 may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. as a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. if these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. covenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries' existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. in addition, covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries' outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular u.s. federal corporate income tax; we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ) for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, generally including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets, a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. although we believe that we currently qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods. 29 the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy . the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. our use of trss is limited under the code. under the code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss. this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss' operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. also, our trss may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an arm's-length basis. we believe our arrangements with our trss are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax. the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. 30 legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us. the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. treasury department. changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, u.s. treasury department regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit , the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit. the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the 2017 tax act ) significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. changes made by the 2017 tax act that could affect us and our stockholders include: temporarily reducing individual u.s. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual u.s. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%; permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-u.s. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of u.s. real property interests from 35% to 21%; limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 to 80% of reit taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction); generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business's adjusted taxable income, except for taxpayers (including most equity reits) that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods); and eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax. many of these changes were effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. the 2017 tax act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the u.s. treasury department and irs, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the 2017 tax act. in addition, it is unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the 2017 tax act may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax act as a whole will have on us. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 62 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 62risk factors 24 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. in that event, the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. we lease a substantial portion of our properties to kindred and brookdale senior living, and each of them is a significant source of our total revenues and operating income. since the kindred master leases and our leases with brookdale senior living are triple-net leases, we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living not only for rental income, but also to pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its 24 table of contents business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. kindred and brookdale senior living have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that either kindred or brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations. the properties managed by sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in sunrise business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. sunrise currently manages 79 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our total revenues and operating income. although we have various rights as owner under the sunrise management agreements, we rely on sunrise personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage our properties efficiently and effectively. we also rely on sunrise to set resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate those properties in accordance with the terms of our management agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on sunrise ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, and sunrise may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or changes in sunrise senior management could adversely affect the income we receive from our sunrise-managed communities and have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any adverse developments in sunrise business and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate our properties efficiently and effectively could have a material adverse effect on us. if sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to the weakened economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, the inability to renew or extend its revolving credit facility, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings under the u.s. bankruptcy code by or against sunrise, any one or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on us. we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors could become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements provide us with the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. in such a case, our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and it is quite likely that any claim we might have for unpaid rent would not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. if such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, would generally be more limited. similarly, if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in the event of an obligor bankruptcy, we may also be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of 25 table of contents our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant, operator or manager. we may be unable to reposition our properties on as favorable terms, or at all, if we have to replace any of our tenants or operators, and we may be subject to delays, limitations and expenses in repositioning our assets. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases upon their expiration. if the kindred master leases, our leases with brookdale senior living or any of our other leases are not renewed, we would be required to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for such repositioning and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such expiration. however, following expiration of the lease term or in the event we exercise our right to replace a tenant upon a lease default, during any period that we are attempting to locate a suitable replacement tenant or operator, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on those properties. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value and avoid the imposition of liens on properties while they are being repositioned. our ability to reposition our properties with another suitable tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. we could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. in the case of our mobs, our ability to locate suitable replacement tenants could be impaired by the specialized medical uses of those properties, and we may be required to spend substantial amounts to adapt the mob to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which can hinder our growth and profitability. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalations. certain of our leases contain escalators contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in the consumer price index. if the revenues generated by our triple-net leased properties as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors or the consumer price index does not increase, our revenues attributes to these leases may not increase. the weakened economy could adversely impact our operating income and earnings, as well as the results of operations of our tenants and operators, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. continued concerns about the u.s. economy and the systemic impact of high unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market and a severely distressed real estate market have contributed to increased market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence. this difficult operating environment could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs at our sunrise-managed properties, thereby reducing our operating income and earnings. it could also have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to maintain occupancy and rates in our properties, which could harm their financial condition. these economic conditions could cause us to experience operating deficiencies at our sunrise-managed properties and/or cause our tenants and operators to be unable to meet their rental payments and other obligations due to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 26 table of contents we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate loan investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully reposition the properties, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under any of our mortgage loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the property and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property investment potential. the borrower may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. if the borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loans upon foreclosure, and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses. even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate loan investments, we may inherit properties that we are unable to expeditiously reposition with new tenants or operators, if at all, which would adversely affect our ability to recover our investment. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our operating assets that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our operating assets, including our sunrise-managed properties and our mobs, that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs, thereby reducing our profitability. these risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in costs of materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) and services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims and the availability and costs of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies at our operating assets which could have a material adverse effect on us. we may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. investments in and acquisitions of these properties, including our pending atria acquisition, entail general risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, that the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and may require costly tenant-specific improvements. in addition, any new development projects that we pursue would be subject to risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the united states would also expose us to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency and tax risks. if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities, or both, to finance future investments, acquisitions or development activity (as we intend to do in our pending atria acquisition), our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could be reduced. 27 table of contents when we attempt to finance, acquire or develop properties, we compete with healthcare providers, other healthcare reits, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. our ability to compete successfully for investment and acquisition opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business objectives and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. even if we succeed in identifying and competing for such opportunities, we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to the properties or businesses we invest in or acquire, the investment or acquisition could divert management attention from our existing business, or the value of such investment or acquisition could decrease substantially, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. as we invest in, and/or acquire or develop, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets or businesses, we expect that the number of operators of our properties and, potentially, our business segments will increase. we cannot assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such businesses. moreover, in some cases, acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. successful integration of the operations of those companies will depend primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures and personnel to eliminate redundancies and costs. potential difficulties we could encounter during integration include the loss of key employees, disruption of our business, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the assumption of unexpected liabilities. in addition, projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process could prove to be inaccurate. if we experience any of these difficulties, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to acquisitions, we might not achieve the economic benefit we expect, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in real estate in particular, seniors housing and healthcare properties. this concentration exposes us to all of the risks inherent in investments in real estate to a greater degree than if our portfolio was diversified, and these risks are magnified by the fact that our real estate investments are limited to properties used in the seniors housing or healthcare industries. if the current downturn in the real estate industry continues or intensifies, it could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. a downturn in the seniors housing or healthcare industries could negatively impact our operating income and earnings, as well as our operators ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions will be limited. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial properties. we cannot give any assurances that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the healthcare industry is highly competitive. the occupancy levels at, and revenues from, our properties depend on the ability of our operators and managers to successfully compete with other operators and managers, including on the bases of scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. we cannot be certain that our operators and managers will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. moreover, our operators and managers may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents and patients or expand their businesses, which could 28 table of contents materially adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past have had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which consequences may not have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators. our ability to invest in non-seniors housing or non-healthcare properties is restricted by the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, so these adverse effects may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside of seniors housing or healthcare properties. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement. over the last several years, the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like kindred, brookdale senior living and sunrise. the extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulation and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could likewise have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators. kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals have been made that would implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers. budget crises and financial shortfalls could also cause states to implement medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by kindred and our other tenants and operators that are currently being reimbursed by medicare, medicaid or private payors. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on 29 table of contents the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us. we have only limited rights to terminate our management agreements with sunrise, and we may be unable to replace sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we and sunrise are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. each management agreement has an original term of 30 years commencing as early as 2004, but may be terminated by us upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject in most cases to sunrise rights to cure such defaults. each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. in addition, we may terminate management agreements based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants. however, various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights. in the event that our management agreements with sunrise are terminated for any reason or are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we will have to find another manager for the properties covered by those agreements. we believe there are a number of qualified national and regional seniors care providers that would be interested in managing our sunrise-managed properties. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it will manage the properties effectively. moreover, any such replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authority and, in most cases, the mortgage lender of the applicable property. we cannot assure you that such approvals would be granted or that, if granted, the process of seeking such approvals would not cause delay. any inability or lengthy delay in replacing sunrise as manager following termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority regarding major decisions, our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2010, we had controlling interests in six mobs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide management and leasing services for the properties, and we had noncontrolling interests of between 5% and 20% in 58 mobs owned through joint ventures with institutional third parties. these joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be prevented from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners. under certain of our joint venture arrangements, we may share decision-making authority with our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property. for joint ventures where we have a noncontrolling interest our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted. prior consent of our joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in such joint ventures; our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; 30 table of contents our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses, distract our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and disrupt the day-to-day operations of the property, such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we currently own twelve seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia. as a result, we are subject to fluctuations in u.s. and canadian exchange rates, which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar will impact the amount of our net income. in addition, if we increase our international presence through investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and/or healthcare assets outside the united states, we may transact additional business in currencies other than u.s. or canadian dollars. although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. revenues from our senior living operations are dependent on private pay sources; events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our daily resident fees could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. by and large, assisted and independent living services currently are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. hence, substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations are derived from private pay sources consisting of income or assets of residents or their family members. in general, due to the expense associated with building new properties and the staffing and other costs of providing services at these properties, only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our properties are located typically can afford to pay the daily resident and care fees. the current economic downturn and depressed housing market, as well as other events such as changes in demographics, could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford these fees. if sunrise or another manager is unable to attract and retain seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of such agreements, limits our uses of these properties and restricts our ability to sell or otherwise transfer such properties . we hold interests in certain of our mob properties through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, through leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located or through similar agreements, and we may acquire or develop additional properties in the future that are subject to similar ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements. under these agreements, we are exposed to the possibility of losing our interests in the property upon termination or an earlier breach by us. in addition, many of our ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties and restrict our right to convey our interest in such agreements, which may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties and impair their value. 31 table of contents overbuilding in markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. barriers to entry in the assisted living and mob industries are not substantial. consequently, the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs could outpace demand. if the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs outpaces demand for those asset types in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. termination of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. applicable regulations governing assisted living communities generally require written resident lease agreements with each resident. most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident lease agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. consistent with these regulations, the resident lease agreements signed by sunrise with respect to our properties managed by it generally allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days notice. thus, sunrise cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements with terms of up to one year or longer. in addition, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if our units remained unoccupied, then our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. volatility or disruption in the capital markets could prevent our counterparties from satisfying their obligations to us. uncertainty in the capital markets and tightening of credit markets, similar to that experienced in recent years, could make accessing new capital more challenging and more expensive for our counterparties. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, any difficulty experienced by our other counterparties, such as letters of credit issuers, insurance carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow agents, in accessing capital or other sources of funds could prevent such counterparties from remaining viable entities and/or satisfying their obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain and/or require in our existing leases and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we continually review the insurance maintained by us and our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost or that we or our tenants, operators and managers will be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance coverage. we also cannot give any assurances as to the future financial viability of our insurers or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. as part of our mob development business, we provide engineering, construction and architectural services, and design, construction or systems failures may result in substantial injury or damage to clients and/or third parties. injury or damage claims may arise in the ordinary course and may be asserted with respect to ongoing or completed projects. although we maintain liability insurance, if any claim results in a 32 table of contents loss, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be adequate to cover the loss in full. if we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to make a payment for the difference and could lose our investment in, and/or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, the affected mob, which could have a material adverse effect on us. significant legal actions could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operation. from time to time, we may be directly involved in lawsuits and other legal proceedings. we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against certain claims and liabilities. an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. our tenants, operators and managers continue to experience increases in both the frequency and severity of professional liability claims. in addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs attorneys continue to seek significant punitive damages and attorneys fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain very high. as a result, the insurance coverage of our tenants, operators and managers might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. in addition, many healthcare providers are pursuing different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance programs that provide less insurance coverage. for example, kindred insures its professional liability risks, in part, through a wholly owned, limited purpose insurance company, which insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate limit, and all claims in excess of the aggregate limit are then insured by the limited purpose insurance company. similarly, sunrise maintains a self-insurance program to cover its general and professional liabilities. our tenants, operators and managers, like kindred and sunrise, that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants, operators and managers of our properties could incur large funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and, in turn, their ability to make rental payments under, or otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us or, with regard to our sunrise-managed properties, our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located is unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may not be able to 33 table of contents compete successfully or it could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create demand for space in our mobs, their inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. we may not be able to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients. the success of our mob business depends, to a large extent, on our past, current and future relationships with hospital and health system clients. we invest a significant amount of time to develop these relationships, and they have helped us to secure acquisition and development opportunities, as well as other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects, with both new and existing clients. if any of our relationships with hospital or health system clients deteriorates, or if a conflict of interest or non-compete arrangement prevents us from expanding these relationships, our ability to secure new acquisition and development opportunities or other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects could be adversely impacted and our professional reputation within the industry could be damaged. our mob development projects, including development projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. a key component of our mob long-term growth strategy is exploring development opportunities and, when appropriate, making investments in those projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular mob development, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. these assumptions are subject to risks normally associated with these projects, including, among others: we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other required governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to market standards; development and construction delays may give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials and labor may increase our development costs; hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; one of our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels projected; competition from other developments may lure away desirable tenants; the demand for the development project may decrease prior to completion; and lease rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions. moreover, in mob development projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis, we generally construct properties for clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which creates risks such as the inability to pass on increased labor and construction material costs to our clients, development and construction delays that could give our counterparties the right to receive penalties from us, and bankruptcy or default by our contractors. we attempt 34 table of contents to mitigate these risks by establishing certain limits on our obligations, shifting some of the risk to the general contractor and/or seeking other legal protections. if any of the foregoing risks occur, our mob development projects, including development projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the operators liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain key personnel, and the loss of any one of them could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees. our future performance will be substantially dependent on our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot give any assurances that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management assessment of the effectiveness of such control. changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. 35 table of contents if the liabilities we have assumed in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we have assumed certain liabilities in connection with our past acquisitions, such as the lillibridge acquisition, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities, and we expect to assume certain liabilities in connection with the atria acquisition, if consummated. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the seller and assumed liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller; liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we have assumed are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the acquired properties of which we were not aware at the time we completed the acquisition, our business could be materially adversely affected. risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan. in order to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan, we may need to raise additional capital. in recent years, the global capital and credit markets have experienced a period of extraordinary turmoil and upheaval, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the u.s. federal government. this disruption in the credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets created difficult conditions for reits and other companies to access capital or other sources of funds. these conditions included greater stock price volatility, significantly less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency. although access to capital and other sources of funding improved in 2010, conditions remain difficult and could deteriorate further. we cannot predict for how long access to capital and other sources of funding will remain constrained or the extent to which our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected. while we currently have no reason to believe that we will be unable to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities in the future, concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of borrowers specifically led many lenders and institutional investors in recent years to reduce and, in some cases, cease funding to borrowers. in addition, the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facilities might have incurred losses or might have reduced capital reserves on account of their prior lending to borrowers, their holdings of certain mortgage securities or their other financial relationships. as a result, these financial institutions might be or become capital constrained and might tighten their lending standards, or become insolvent. if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity, or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, these lenders might not be able or willing to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could also adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. 36 table of contents to address any such capital constraints, we could, among other things, (i) obtain commitments from the remaining banks in our lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, (ii) access the public capital markets, (iii) obtain secured loans from government-sponsored entities, pension funds or similar sources, (iv) decrease or eliminate distributions to our stockholders or pay taxable stock dividends, and/or (v) delay or cease our acquisition and investment activity. as with other public companies, the availability of debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading levels of our bonds and the market price of our common stock, which, in turn, depend upon various market conditions, such as the market perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and future earnings and cash distributions, that change from time to time. our failure to meet the market expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect our bond trading levels and the market price of our common stock. moreover, a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could cause our borrowing costs to increase and impact our ability to access capital. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which could also result in adverse tax consequences to us. restrictions on our uses and right to transfer our properties under certain healthcare regulations, ground leases, mortgages and other agreements to which our properties may be subject could adversely impact our ability to timely liquidate those investments and could impair the value of our properties. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time we mortgage our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition and investment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets 37 table of contents provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, our interest costs for our existing floating rate debt and any new debt we incur would also increase. this increased cost could have the effect of reducing our profitability or making our lease and other revenues insufficient to meet our obligations, and could make the financing of any acquisition or investment activity more costly. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing. an increase in interest rates may also decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using hedging arrangements that involve risk, including the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we may earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may result in higher interest rates than we would otherwise have. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. in addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect 38 table of contents our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our reit status so long as the ratio of our debt to adjusted total assets (as each term is defined in the indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. however, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments. although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. in addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may, if possible, borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock or 9.0% of our common stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered to be excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. we have the right to buy the excess shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we buy the shares, but if we do not purchase them, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the excess shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 39 table of contents if we decide to pay taxable stock dividends to meet the reit distribution requirements, your tax liability may be greater than the amount of cash you receive. under revenue procedure 2010-12, the irs has stated that it will treat stock dividends as distributions for purposes of satisfying the reit distribution requirements for calendar years 2008 through 2012 if each stockholder can elect to receive the distribution in cash, even if the aggregate cash amount paid to all stockholders is limited, provided certain requirements are met. accordingly, if we decide to pay a stock dividend in accordance with revenue procedure 2010-12, your tax liability with respect to such dividend may be significantly greater than the amount of cash you receive. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 75 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 75 table of contentsrisk factors 29 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently deem not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. in that event, the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. the properties we lease to kindred and brookdale senior living account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi, and since the kindred master leases and our leases with brookdale senior living are triple-net leases, we also depend on kindred and brookdale senior living to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. we cannot provide any assurance that kindred and brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy those obligations, and any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. kindred and brookdale senior living have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot provide any assurance that either kindred or brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations. the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; although atria and sunrise are managers, not tenants, of our properties, adverse developments in their businesses and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. as of december 31, 2011, atria and sunrise, collectively, managed 197 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on atria's and sunrise's personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively. we also rely on atria and sunrise to set resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our properties in accordance with the terms of our management agreements 29 table of contents and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on atria's and sunrise's ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise or atria to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, and atria or sunrise may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by atria or sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing communities and have a material adverse effect on us. because atria and sunrise manage, but do not lease, our properties, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triple-net tenant. however, any adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a material adverse effect on us. if atria or sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties due to the weakened economy or otherwise, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a material adverse effect on us. we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors could become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements provide us with the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. in such a case, our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap could be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. if such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, are generally more limited. similarly, if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in the event of an obligor bankruptcy, we may also be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant, operator or manager. if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. if the kindred master leases, our leases with brookdale senior living or any of our other leases are not renewed, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in case of non-renewal, we generally have one year prior to expiration of the lease term to arrange for repositioning of the properties and our tenants are required to continue to perform all of their obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for the non-renewed assets until such 30 table of contents expiration. however, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant or operator in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator. we also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. we could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. in addition, our ability to locate suitable replacement tenants could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be required to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. we have only limited rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we are parties to long-term management agreements with each of atria and sunrise pursuant to which atria and sunrise, collectively, provide comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 197 of our seniors housing communities. each management agreement with atria has a term of ten years commencing in 2011, subject to successive automatic ten-year renewal periods, and each management agreement with sunrise has a term of 30 years commencing as early as 2004. each management agreement with atria or sunrise may be terminated by us upon the occurrence of an event of default by atria or sunrise, respectively, in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any license or certificate necessary for operation), subject in most cases to the defaulting party's right to cure such default, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to atria or sunrise, respectively. in addition, we may terminate each management agreement with atria based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets, and we may terminate each management agreement with sunrise based on the failure to achieve certain noi targets or to comply with certain expense control covenants. under certain circumstances, we may also terminate each management agreement with atria upon the payment of a fee. notwithstanding the provisions in our management agreements, legal, contractual and other considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights. in the event that our management agreements with atria or sunrise are terminated for any reason or are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we would attempt to find another manager for the properties covered by those agreements. although we believe that many qualified national and regional seniors care providers would be interested in managing our seniors housing communities, we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that it would manage the properties effectively. moreover, any such replacement manager would require approval by the applicable regulatory authorities and, in most cases, the mortgage lenders for the properties, and we cannot provide any assurance that such approvals would be granted on a timely basis or at all. any inability or lengthy delay in replacing atria or sunrise as manager following termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. 31 table of contents our significant acquisition activity presents certain risks to our business and operations. in 2010 and 2011, we acquired or signed definitive agreements to acquire more than $12 billion of assets, including our acquisitions of lillibridge, nhp and substantially all of the real estate assets of aslg and our pending acquisition of cogdell. our significant acquisition activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that: we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations or information technology of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions within the anticipated timeframe or at all; we may be unable to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees; projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate; acquisitions could divert management's attention from our existing assets; the value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline; and we may be unable to continue paying dividends at the current rate. we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquired properties or integrate acquisitions without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to contingent rent escalators, which can hinder our growth and profitability. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalations. certain of our leases contain escalators contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue parameters or based on changes in the consumer price index. if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors, the revenues generated by our triple-net leased properties do not meet the specified parameters or the consumer price index does not increase, our growth and profitability will be hindered by these leases. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our operating assets, which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our senior living and mob operating assets, which could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. these operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in costs of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) and other services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. any or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our senior living operations or mob operations reportable business segments, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 32 table of contents the weakened economy could adversely impact our revenues and operating income, as well as the operating results of our tenants and operators, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. continued concerns about the u.s. economy and the systemic impact of high unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market and a severely distressed real estate market have contributed to increased market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence. if this difficult operating environment continues or worsens, it could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues in our senior living and mob operations, thereby reducing our operating income or causing us to experience operating deficiencies. it could also have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to maintain occupancy and rates in our properties, which could harm their financial condition and impair their ability to make their rental payments and satisfy their other obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. legislation to address the federal government's projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. president obama and members of the u.s. congress have recently proposed various spending cuts and tax reform initiatives to reduce the federal government's projected operating deficit. some of these initiatives could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to medicare, medicaid or medicare advantage plans. future federal legislation relating to deficit reduction that reduces reimbursement payments to healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on our operators' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loan investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully reposition the properties, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under any of our mortgage loans, to protect our interest, we may foreclose on the loan or acquire title to the property and make substantial improvements or repairs to maximize the property's investment potential. in response to our actions to enforce mortgage obligations, the defaulting borrower may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies, or bring claims for lender liability. if the borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in property value could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our mortgage loans upon foreclosure, and we could be required to record valuation allowance for such losses. even if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loan investments, we may inherit properties that we are unable to expeditiously reposition with new tenants or operators, if at all, which would adversely affect our ability to recover our investment. our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and healthcare assets may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and healthcare assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness. investments in and acquisitions of these properties entail general risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment's performance will fail to meet expectations, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will 33 table of contents underperform. furthermore, healthcare properties are often highly customized and may require costly tenant-specific improvements. our ability to compete successfully for investment and acquisition opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. when we attempt to finance, acquire or develop properties, we compete with other healthcare reits, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity firms and other investors, some of whom have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business objectives and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. see "business competition" included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, new development projects that we pursue may experience construction delays or cost overruns that increase our expenses, fail to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, or remain incomplete after incurring significant development costs. investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the united states create additional legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations and foreign tax risks. if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities, or both, to finance future investments, acquisitions or development activity, our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in seniors housing and healthcare properties, and our ability to make investments outside the seniors housing or healthcare industries is restricted by the terms of our existing indebtedness. this concentration exposes us to greater economic risk than if our portfolio included real estate assets in other industries or non-real estate assets. for example, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement can have material adverse consequences on the healthcare industry, some of which may be unintended. we cannot provide any assurance that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not adversely affect the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators, which could have a more pronounced effect on us than if our investments were further diversified. the healthcare industry is also highly competitive. the occupancy levels at, and revenues from, our properties depend on the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to successfully compete with other operators and managers, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. we cannot be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to attract residents and patients or expand their businesses, which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us and have a material adverse effect on us. real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. in the event we desire or need to sell any of our properties, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at a price or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by the current downturn in the real estate industry or any weakness in the seniors housing and healthcare industries. in addition, transfers of healthcare properties may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of 34 table of contents commercial properties. we cannot provide any assurance that we will recognize full value for any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement. over the last several years, the regulatory environment of the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like kindred, brookdale senior living, atria and sunrise. the extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see "governmental regulation healthcare regulation" included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we are unable to predict future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators. certain of our tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider medicaid rate freezes or cuts. see "governmental regulation healthcare regulation" included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. similarly, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot provide any assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by our tenants and operators that currently depend on medicare, medicaid or private payor reimbursement. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us. 35 table of contents revenues from our senior living operations are dependent on private pay sources; events which adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford daily resident fees at our seniors housing communities could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. by and large, assisted and independent living services currently are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. hence, substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our senior living operations are derived from private pay sources consisting of income or assets of residents or their family members. in general, due to the expense associated with building new properties and the staffing and other costs of providing services at these properties, only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our properties are located typically can afford to pay the daily resident and care fees. the continued weak economy and depressed housing market, as well as other events such as changes in demographics, could adversely affect the ability of seniors and their families to afford these fees. if the managers of our seniors housing communities are unable to attract and retain seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority regarding major decisions, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners, and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2011, we had controlling interests in eleven mobs and eighteen seniors housing communities owned through joint ventures with third parties, and we had noncontrolling interests of between 5% and 25% in 58 mobs, 20 seniors housing communities and fourteen skilled nursing facilities owned through joint ventures with third parties. these joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; for joint ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose; our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted without prior consent of our joint venture partners; our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; we may disagree with our joint venture partners about decisions affecting a property or the joint venture, which could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and 36 table of contents we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. our ownership of twelve seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia subjects us to fluctuations in u.s. and canadian exchange rates, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. if we increase our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states, we may transact business in currencies other than u.s. or canadian dollars. although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot provide any assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of such agreements, limits our uses of these properties and restricts our ability to sell or otherwise transfer such properties. we have investments in many of our mobs and certain other properties through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, through leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located or through similar agreements, and we may acquire or develop additional properties in the future that are subject to similar ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements. under these agreements, we could lose our interests in the property upon termination or an earlier breach by us. in addition, many of our ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our right to convey our interests in such properties, which may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties and impair their value, or restrict the leasing of such properties, which may negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. overbuilding in markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. the seniors housing and mob industries generally have limited barriers to entry, and, as a consequence, the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs could outpace demand. if development outpaces demand for those asset types in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. termination of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. applicable regulations governing assisted living communities generally require a written lease agreement with each resident that gives the resident the right to terminate his or her lease agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. consistent with these regulations, the resident lease agreements entered into by the managers of our seniors housing communities generally allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days' notice. thus, unlike typical apartment lease agreements that have terms of one year or longer, our managers cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time. in addition, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if the affected units remain unoccupied, our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. 37 table of contents the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs. our mob operations depend on the viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated health systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. the viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. if a hospital on or near whose campus one of our mobs is located is unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create demand for space in our mobs, their inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. volatility or disruption in the capital markets could prevent our counterparties from satisfying their obligations to us. uncertainty in the capital markets and tightening of credit markets, similar to that experienced in recent years, could make accessing new capital more challenging and more expensive for our counterparties. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, any difficulty in accessing capital or other sources of funds experienced by our other counterparties, such as letters of credit issuers, insurance carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow agents, could prevent such counterparties from remaining viable entities or satisfying their obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain or require in our existing lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain adequate insurance coverage on our properties and their operations. although we continually review the scope and level of insurance maintained by us and our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot provide any assurance that we or our tenants, operators and managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. we also cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot provide any assurance that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. 38 table of contents as part of our mob development business, we provide engineering, construction and architectural services, and any design, construction or systems failures related to the properties we develop may result in substantial injury or damage to clients or third parties. injury or damage claims may arise in the ordinary course and may be asserted with respect to ongoing or completed projects. although we maintain liability insurance, if any claim results in a loss, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage would be adequate to cover the loss in full. if we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to make a payment for the difference and could lose our investment in, or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, the affected mob, which could have a material adverse effect on us. significant legal actions could subject us or our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators and managers for which such tenants, operators and managers may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. an unfavorable resolution of any such pending or future litigation could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us. in some of these cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys' fees. due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare and seniors housing providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain very high. as a result, our insurance coverage and the insurance coverage of our tenants, operators and managers might not cover all claims against us or them and might not be available to us or them at a reasonable cost. if we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. in an effort to reduce and manage their costs and for various other reasons, many companies in the healthcare industry, including some of our tenants, operators and managers, are pursuing different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or programs (commonly referred to as "captives") that may provide them with less insurance coverage. those companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. as a result, the tenants, operators and managers of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us or, in the case of our senior living operations, our results of operations and, in either case, have a material adverse effect on us. likewise, if we decide to implement a captive, any large funded and unfunded professional liability expenses that we incur could have a material adverse effect on us. we may not be able to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients. the success of our mob business depends, to a large extent, on our past, current and future relationships with hospital and health system clients. we invest a significant amount of time to develop 39 table of contents these relationships, and our relationships have helped us to secure acquisition and development opportunities, as well as other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects, with both new and existing clients. if our relationships with hospital or health system clients deteriorate, or if a conflict of interest or non-compete arrangement prevents us from expanding these relationships, our ability to secure new acquisition and development opportunities or other advisory, property management and hospital project management projects could be adversely impacted and our professional reputation within the industry could be damaged. our mob development projects, including development projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns. a key component of our mob long-term growth strategy is exploring development opportunities and, when appropriate, making investments in those projects. in deciding whether to make an investment in a particular mob development, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. these assumptions are subject to risks normally associated with these projects, including, among others, that: we may be unable to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all; we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts; we may encounter delays in obtaining or fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop the property to market standards; development or construction delays may provide tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs; volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our development costs; hospitals or health systems may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule; our builders may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; we may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions; tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels projected; demand for our development project may decrease prior to completion, including due to competition from other developments; and lease rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including market and economic conditions. moreover, in mob development projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis, we generally construct properties for clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which creates risks such as the inability to pass on increased labor and construction material costs to our clients, development and construction delays that could give our counterparties the right to receive penalties from us, and bankruptcy or default by our contractors. we attempt to mitigate these risks by establishing certain limits on our obligations, shifting some of the risk to the general contractor or seeking other legal protections, but we cannot provide any assurance that our mitigation efforts will be effective. if any of the risks described above occur, our mob development projects, including development projects undertaken on a fee-for-service basis or through our joint ventures, may not yield anticipated returns, which could materially adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us. 40 table of contents economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our noi is attributed could adversely affect our financial results. for the year ended december 31, 2011, approximately 42.1% of our noi was derived from properties located in california (12.5%), illinois (7.1%), texas (6.1%), massachusetts (5.8%), new york (5.7%), and florida (4.9%). as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, increased competition or decreased demand, and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see "governmental regulation healthcare regulation" included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see "governmental regulation environmental regulation" included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain key personnel, and the loss of any one of them could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of 41 table of contents such control. changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. if the liabilities we have assumed in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we may have certain liabilities in connection with our acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the sellers, the properties, their operations and/or their liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers; liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that our past acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we have assumed are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time we completed the acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2011, we had approximately $6.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness (including capital lease obligations). the instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may elect to meet our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing. 42 table of contents in addition, from time to time, we mortgage our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition and investment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers' acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, our interest costs for our existing floating rate debt and any new debt we incur would also increase. this increased cost could reduce our profitability, make our lease and other revenues insufficient to meet our obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition and investment activity. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing. an increase in interest rates may also decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve risk, including the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we may earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may result in higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy. we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in recent years, the global capital and credit markets experienced a period of extraordinary turmoil and upheaval, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the u.s. federal government. the disruption in the credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets created difficult conditions for reits and other companies to access capital or other sources of funds. although access to capital and other sources of funding have improved, we cannot provide any assurance that conditions will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. in addition, the federal government's failure to increase the amount of debt that it is statutorily permitted to incur as needed to meet its future financial commitments or a downgrade in the debt rating on u.s. government securities could lead to a weakened u.s. dollar, rising interest rates and constrained access to capital, which could materially adversely affect the u.s. and global economies, increase our costs of borrowing and have a material adverse effect on us. 43 table of contents to address constraints on our access to capital, we could, among other things, (i) obtain commitments from the banks in our lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility or our unsecured term loan facilities, (ii) access the public capital markets, (iii) obtain secured loans from government-sponsored entities, pension funds or similar sources, (iv) decrease or eliminate our distributions to our stockholders or pay taxable stock dividends, or (v) delay or cease our acquisition and investment activity. as with other public companies, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market's perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs. if we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which could also result in adverse tax consequences to us. restrictions on our uses of, and our right to transfer, properties under certain healthcare regulations, ground leases, mortgages and other agreements to which our properties may be subject could adversely impact our ability to timely liquidate those investments and impair their value. if the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facility become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. adverse conditions in the credit markets could also adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; 44 table of contents we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see "certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements" included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. however, such distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments. although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to do so. for example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may, if possible, borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see " risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy." the terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock or more than 9.0% of our common stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered to be "excess shares" and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. in addition, we have the right to purchase the excess 45 table of contents shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, but if we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. if we decide to pay taxable stock dividends to meet the reit distribution requirements, your tax liability may be greater than the amount of cash you receive. under revenue procedure 2010-12, the irs has stated that it will treat stock dividends as distributions for purposes of satisfying the reit distribution requirements for calendar years 2008 through 2012 if each stockholder can elect to receive the distribution in cash, even if the aggregate cash amount paid to all stockholders is limited, provided certain requirements are met. accordingly, if we decide to pay a stock dividend in accordance with revenue procedure 2010-12, your tax liability with respect to such dividend may be significantly greater than the amount of cash you receive. 46 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 91

item 7a. 50 table of contents index to financial statementsrisk factors 25 risk factors our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. some of these risks are described below. however, this section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material factors. if any of the following risks actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living; kindred or brookdale senior living inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a reit. we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living in a number of ways: we lease a substantial portion of our properties to kindred under the kindred master leases, and therefore kindred was the source of a significant majority of our total revenues in 2005 and 2004 and continues to be a majority source of our revenues; as a result of the provident acquisition, subsidiaries of brookdale senior living, brookdale and alterra, the operators of the provident properties, now account for a significant portion of our revenues; and 25 table of contents since the kindred master leases and our leases with brookdale and alterra are triple-net leases, we depend on kindred, brookdale and alterra to pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties. we cannot assure you that kindred or brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us. in addition, any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. we may be unable to find another lessee/operator for our properties if we have to replace kindred, brookdale, alterra or our other operators. we may have to find another lessee/operator for the properties covered by one or more of the kindred master leases or the leases with brookdale, alterra or our other operators upon the expiration of the terms of the applicable lease or upon a default by kindred, brookdale, alterra or our other operators. during any period that we are attempting to locate one or more lessees/operators, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by kindred, brookdale or alterra or our other operators. we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable lessee/operator or, if we are successful in locating such an operator, that the rental payments from the new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. our ability to locate another suitable lessee/operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. in addition, we may also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. such delays, limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. we may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional healthcare-related and/or seniors housing assets. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional healthcare-related and/or seniors housing assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. investments in and acquisitions of these properties entail general investment risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate or the lessee/operator will fail to meet performance expectations. in addition, investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the united states would subject us to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency and tax risks. if we pursue new development projects, these projects would be subject to numerous risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. in addition, we may borrow to finance any investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, healthcare-related, seniors housing and/ or other properties, which would increase our leverage. we compete for investment or acquisition opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than we do. our ability to compete successfully for these opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. competition generally may reduce the number of suitable investment or acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition or development activities. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. 26 table of contents even if we are successful at identifying and competing for investment or acquisition opportunities, these opportunities involve a number of risks. these risks include diversion of management attention, the risk that the value of the properties or businesses we invest in or acquire could decrease substantially after such investment or acquisition and the risk that we will be unable to accurately assess the value of properties or businesses that are not of the type we currently own, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. additionally, if we are successful in continuing to implement our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional healthcare-related and/or seniors housing assets or businesses, we intend to increase the number of operators of our properties and, potentially, our business segments. we cannot assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such businesses. our investments are concentrated in healthcare-related and seniors housing properties, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in real estate in particular, healthcare-related and seniors housing properties. accordingly, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and these risks become even greater due to the fact that all of our investments are in properties used in the healthcare or seniors housing industries. a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties. a downturn in the healthcare or seniors housing industries could negatively impact our operators ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past have had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which may not even have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including our lessees/operators. our ability to invest in non-healthcare, non-healthcare-related or non-seniors housing properties is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility, so these adverse effects may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside of healthcare and seniors housing. our tenants, including kindred, may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement. we believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like kindred. the extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. federal and state governments have intensified enforcement policies, resulting in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if kindred or our other tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. kindred and our other tenants also could be forced to expend 27 table of contents considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in addition, as part of a settlement agreement kindred entered into with the federal government, kindred agreed to comply with the terms of a corporate integrity agreement. kindred could incur additional expenses in complying with the corporate integrity agreement, and any failure to comply with the corporate integrity agreement could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and its ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations. changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on kindred and our other operators, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants. kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers, such as the proposed rule issued by cms on january 19, 2006 updating ltac pps payment rates for the 2007 rate year. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by kindred and other tenants which are currently being reimbursed by medicare, medicaid or private payors. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of kindred and certain of our other operators and tenants, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. significant legal actions could subject our operators to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our operators liquidity, financial condition and results of operation. although claims and costs of professional liability insurance seem to be growing at a slower pace, our skilled nursing facility operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of professional liability claims in recent years. in addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs attorneys continue to seek significant punitive damages and attorneys fees. due to the high level in the number and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been severely restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage have increased dramatically. as a result, the insurance coverage of our operators might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. if our operators are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. kindred insures its professional liability risks in part through a wholly-owned, limited purpose insurance company. the limited purpose insurance company insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate limit. the limited purpose insurance company then insures all claims in excess of the aggregate limit for the unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. kindred maintains general liability insurance and professional malpractice liability insurance in amounts and with deductibles which kindred management has indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations. 28 table of contents operators that insure their professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of professional liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the increase in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and we cannot assure you that these operators reserves for future claims will be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. if the actual cost of claims is significantly higher than the operators reserves, it could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of our operators and their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of our operators and their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by such operators, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we have assumed substantially all of provident liabilities, including contingent liabilities; if these liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are unknown provident obligations, our business could be materially adversely affected. as a result of the provident acquisition, we have assumed substantially all of provident liabilities, including contingent liabilities to which provident succeeded when it acquired the ownership interests in the properties that are currently leased to brookdale and alterra. we may learn additional information about provident business and liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with provident or the former property owners; liabilities, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to the provident acquisition, including periods prior to the acquisition of the brookdale and alterra properties by provident; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by provident or the former property owners; and 29 table of contents liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to the provident acquisition, including taxes associated with the acquisition or prior ownership of the brookdale and alterra properties. as a result, we cannot assure you that the provident acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if provident liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of provident of which we were not aware at the time of completion of the acquisition, or if the provident acquisition fails to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code, it could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.8 billion of indebtedness. our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to incur substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. a high level of indebtedness may have the following consequences: a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of debt service, thus reducing the funds available for our business strategy and for distributions to stockholders; potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare industries; a potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and a potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our cost of borrowing. we may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments. in order to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments, we may need to raise additional capital. our ability to incur additional indebtedness is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. in addition, adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which we can obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable. in such circumstances, we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets or liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on the investments and that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. in addition, certain healthcare regulations may constrain our ability to sell assets. we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to floating interest rates, which can have the effect of reducing our profitability. we receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk and can have the effect of reducing our profitability or making our lease and other revenue insufficient to meet our obligations. we are not limited in the amount of floating rate debt we may incur. 30 table of contents risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, if we fail to qualify as a reit, all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of fifteen percent) with respect to distributions. we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. in addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations federal income taxation of ventas and requirements for qualification as a reit included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the 90 percent distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90 percent distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our reit status so long as the ratio of our debt to adjusted total assets (as each term is defined in the indentures) does not exceed 60 percent and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. however, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments. although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 percent distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. this may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, 31 table of contents and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. in addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 percent distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure we may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments. the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions. we may still be subject to corporate level taxes. following our reit election, we are considered to be a former c corporation for income tax purposes. therefore, we remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes for any kindred asset dispositions occurring between january 1, 1999 and december 31, 2008. also, as a consequence of the provident acquisition, we remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes if we dispose of any of the brookdale properties before november 2014. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 50 table of contentsrisk factors 24 risk factors risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. in that event, the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living; kindred or brookdale senior living inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit. we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living in the following ways: we lease a substantial portion of our properties to kindred and subsidiaries of brookdale senior living, and therefore kindred and brookdale senior living accounted for most of our total revenues in 2006 and 2005, and they are expected to continue to be significant sources of our revenues; and since the kindred master leases and our leases with subsidiaries of brookdale senior living are triple-net leases, we depend on kindred and those subsidiaries to pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties. we cannot assure you that kindred or brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us. in addition, any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in its properties. any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us or to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on us. we may be unable to find another tenant or operator for our properties if we have to replace kindred, subsidiaries of brookdale senior living or any of our other tenants or operators. we may have to find another tenant or operator for the properties covered by one or more of the kindred master leases or our leases with subsidiaries of brookdale senior living or any of our other tenants or operators 24 table of contents upon the expiration of the terms of the applicable lease or upon a default by kindred or any of those subsidiaries, tenants or operators. during any period that we are attempting to locate one or more tenants or operators, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on those properties. we cannot assure you that kindred, subsidiaries of brookdale senior living or any of our other tenants or operators will elect to renew their respective leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof, nor can we assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable tenant or operator or, if we are successful in locating such a tenant/operator, that the rental payments from that new tenant or operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. our ability to locate another suitable tenant or operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. we also may incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. any such delays, limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. we may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. investments in and acquisitions of these properties entail general risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, that the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate or that the tenant/operator will fail to meet performance expectations. in addition, investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the united states, would subject us to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency and tax risks. any new development projects that we pursue would also be subject to numerous risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. in addition, we may borrow to finance any investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing, healthcare-related and/ or other properties, which would increase our leverage. we compete for investment or acquisition opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than we do. our ability to compete successfully for these opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. competition generally may reduce the number of suitable investment or acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition or development activities. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. even if we succeed in identifying and competing for investment or acquisition opportunities, these opportunities would subject us to the risk that the value of the properties or businesses we invest in or acquire could decrease substantially after such investment or acquisition, that we might be unable to accurately assess the value of properties or businesses that are not of the type we currently own or that the investment or acquisition would divert management attention from our existing business, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, as we continue to implement our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets or businesses, we intend to increase the number of operators of our properties and, potentially, our business segments. we cannot assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such businesses. 25 table of contents our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare-related properties, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in real estate in particular, seniors housing and healthcare-related properties. accordingly, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and these risks become even greater due to the fact that all of our investments are in properties used in the seniors housing or healthcare industries. a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties. a downturn in the seniors housing or healthcare industries could negatively impact our operators ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past have had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which may not even have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including our tenants/operators. our ability to invest in non-seniors housing or non-healthcare-related properties is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility, so these adverse effects may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside of seniors housing or healthcare. we may not complete the proposed acquisition of sunrise reit, and if we do, we may not be able to successfully integrate sunrise reit operations or we may not realize the intended benefits of the transaction, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. it is possible that the proposed acquisition of sunrise reit may not be completed. the parties obligations to complete the transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, some of which are beyond our control. for example, the transaction is conditioned on the receipt of the required approval of sunrise reit unitholders. if this approval is not received, the transaction cannot be completed even if all of the other conditions are satisfied or waived. if we do not complete the proposed acquisition of sunrise reit for any reason, we will have incurred substantial costs related to the transaction, such as legal, accounting and certain financial advisor fees, which must be paid even if the transaction is not completed (although we will be entitled to receive a termination fee under certain circumstances). even if we complete the proposed acquisition of sunrise reit, however, we will be subject to a number of operating risks, including the risks that: we may not effectively integrate the operations of sunrise reit; the acquired properties may not perform as well as we anticipate due to various factors, such as disruptions caused by the integration of operations with us and changes in economic conditions; the diversion of management attention to the integration of operations could have a negative impact on our existing business; and we may experience greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to the integration of sunrise reit and/or may not realize the expected revenues and cost savings from the transaction within the expected timeframe, if at all. certain of our tenants and operators, including kindred, may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement. we believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has

tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. kindred and our other tenants and operators also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in addition, kindred could incur significant expenses in complying with a corporate integrity agreement that was part of its previous settlement with the federal government, and any failure to comply with that agreement could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and its ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations. changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on kindred and our other tenants and operators, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the

we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by kindred and other tenants and operators which are currently being reimbursed by medicare, medicaid or private payors. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.

these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators,

contents unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with provident or the former property owners; liabilities, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to the provident acquisition, including periods prior to provident acquisition of the brookdale and alterra properties; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by provident or the former property owners; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to the provident acquisition, including taxes associated with the acquisition or prior ownership of the brookdale and alterra properties. as a result, we cannot assure you that the provident acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if provident liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of provident of which we were not aware at the time we completed the acquisition, or if the provident acquisition fails to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code, it could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2006, we had approximately $2.3 billion of indebtedness. our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to incur substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our cost of borrowing. we may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to consummate the proposed sunrise reit acquisition, to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments. in order to consummate the proposed sunrise reit acquisition, to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments, we may need to raise additional capital. although we expect to fund a portion of the acquisition through a fully committed bridge facility, composed of a $1.0 billion senior interim loan and a $600.0 million perpetual preferred stock issuance, we will be required to repay any amounts drawn on the loan within one year from the closing date. the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. in addition, adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable. in those circumstances, we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets or liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which could result in adverse tax consequences to us. moreover, certain healthcare regulations may constrain our ability to sell assets. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to consummate the proposed sunrise reit acquisition, to continue to implement our business plan or to meet our debt service obligations, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. 29 table of contents we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to floating interest rates, which could have the effect of reducing our profitability. we receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk and can have the effect of reducing our profitability or making our lease and other revenue insufficient to meet our obligations. the amount of floating rate debt versus fixed rate debt we may incur is not limited. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, if we fail to qualify as a reit, all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%) with respect to distributions. we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. in addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations federal income taxation of ventas and requirements for qualification as a reit included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual 30 table of contents distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our reit status so long as the ratio of our debt to adjusted total assets (as each term is defined in the indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. however, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments. although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. this may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. in addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure we may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to consummate the proposed sunrise reit acquisition, to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments. the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions. we may still be subject to corporate level taxes. following our reit election and due to the acquisition of provident, we are considered to be a former c corporation for income tax purposes. therefore, we remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes for any kindred asset dispositions occurring before december 31, 2008. also, as a consequence of the provident acquisition, we remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes if we dispose of any of the brookdale properties before november 2014. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 50 table of contentsrisk factors 27 risk factors risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. in that event, the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living; either of kindred or brookdale senior living inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit. we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living in the following ways: we lease a substantial portion of our properties to kindred and subsidiaries of brookdale senior living, and therefore kindred and brookdale senior living accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues in 2007 and 2006, and they are expected to continue to be significant sources of our revenues; since the kindred master leases and our leases with subsidiaries of brookdale senior living are triple-net leases, we depend on kindred and those subsidiaries to pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties; and 27 table of contents kindred and certain subsidiaries of brookdale senior living have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. we cannot assure you that kindred or brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us. in addition, any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in its properties. any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us or to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on us. we may be unable to find another tenant or operator for our properties if we have to replace kindred, subsidiaries of brookdale senior living or any of our other tenants or operators. we may have to find another tenant or operator for the properties covered by one or more of the kindred master leases or our leases with subsidiaries of brookdale senior living or any of our other tenants or operators upon the expiration of the terms of the applicable lease or upon a default by kindred or any of those subsidiaries, tenants or operators. during any period that we are attempting to locate one or more tenants or operators, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on those properties. we cannot assure you that kindred, subsidiaries of brookdale senior living or any of our other tenants or operators will elect to renew their respective leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof, nor can we assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable tenant or operator or, if we are successful in locating such a tenant or operator, that the rental payments from that new tenant or operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. our ability to locate another suitable tenant or operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, con or other laws, as well as by medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. we also may incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. any such delays, limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. we may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility, our canadian credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. investments in and acquisitions of these properties, including the properties acquired in connection with the acquisition of the assets of sunrise reit, entail general risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, that the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate or that the tenant or operator will fail to meet performance expectations. in addition, investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the united states would subject us to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency and tax risks. any new development projects that we pursue would also be subject to numerous risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. in addition, we may borrow to finance any investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing, healthcare-related and/or other properties, which would increase our leverage. we compete for investment and acquisition opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than we do. our ability to compete successfully for these opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our 28 table of contents competitors. competition generally may reduce the number of suitable investment and acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. even if we succeed in identifying and competing for investment or acquisition opportunities, these opportunities would subject us to the risk that the value of the properties or businesses we invest in or acquire could decrease substantially after such investment or acquisition, that we might be unable to accurately assess the value of properties or businesses that are not of the type we currently own or that the investment or acquisition would divert management attention from our existing business, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, as we continue to implement our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets or businesses, we intend to increase the number of operators of our properties and, potentially, our business segments. we cannot assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such businesses. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare-related properties, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in real estate in particular, seniors housing and healthcare-related properties. accordingly, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and these risks are magnified by the fact that our real estate investments are limited to properties used in the seniors housing or healthcare industries. a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. a downturn in the seniors housing or healthcare industries could negatively impact our operators ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past have had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which consequences may not have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including our tenants and operators. our ability to invest in non-seniors housing or non-healthcare-related properties is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility and our canadian credit facility, so these adverse effects may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside of seniors housing or healthcare. our tenants, managers and operators may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement. we believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like kindred, brookdale senior living and sunrise. the extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. federal and state governments have intensified enforcement policies, resulting in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. 29 table of contents if our tenants, managers or operators fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, managers and operators also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in addition, failure of our tenants, managers or operators to comply with the applicable healthcare regulations could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by it which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations. changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, managers and operators, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators. kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers, such as the proposed rule issued by cms on january 29, 2008 updating ltac pps payment rates for the 2009 rate year and the president proposed 2009 budget that could affect snf pps rates. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by kindred and our other tenants and operators which are currently being reimbursed by medicare, medicaid or private payors. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. the properties managed by sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues, and sunrise is currently experiencing significant legal, accounting and regulatory difficulties. sunrise currently manages 79 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their original cost, and account for a significant portion of our revenues. according to public disclosures, sunrise is currently reviewing its strategic alternatives and is experiencing significant legal, accounting and regulatory difficulties. sunrise announced that it intends to file its annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2006 no later than march 17, 2008, although there can be no assurance it will do so. if sunrise does not so file, its shares will likely be delisted from the new york stock exchange. the diversion of sunrise management and employee attention away from the operation of our properties to the strategic review process and these other difficulties could adversely affect the performance of our assets, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot assure you that these issues will not harm sunrise business reputation or its ability to attract and retain qualified employees and to enlist and maintain residents in our properties, which also could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that the resolution of these uncertainties will have on our financial condition and results of operations. the failure or inability of sunrise to satisfy its legal, accounting and regulatory requirements and to pay and perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on us. 30 table of contents we rely on sunrise to manage a significant number of our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively; sunrise inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. although we have various rights as owner under the sunrise management agreements, we are relying on sunrise personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage a significant number of our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively. we are also relying on sunrise to set resident fees and otherwise operate those properties pursuant to our management agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. any change in the senior management of sunrise or any adverse developments in sunrise business and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate our properties efficiently and effectively could have a material adverse effect on us. for example, we depend on sunrise ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may require that sunrise enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, the costs of which are included in the operating budget for each property. sunrise may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in these costs or any failure by sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect the income we receive from these properties. in addition, any inability or unwillingness on sunrise part to satisfy its obligations under the management agreements it has with us could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our seniors housing communities managed by sunrise that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. historically, we have leased our healthcare properties, other than our mobs, to healthcare operating companies under triple-net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property-related expenses and to make rental payments to us. as a result of the sunrise reit acquisition, however, we are now exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our sunrise-managed properties that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs, thereby reducing our profitability. these risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in costs of materials, energy, labor and services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims and the availability and costs of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies at our sunrise-managed properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we have only limited rights to terminate our management agreements with sunrise, and we may be unable to replace sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we and sunrise are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. each management agreement has a term of 30 years and may only be terminated by us upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject in each case to sunrise rights to cure deficiencies, or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. we can also terminate the management agreement if a pool of properties fails to achieve a targeted net operating income level over a twelve-month period, other than as a result of a default by sunrise. consequently, in order to terminate sunrise management agreement on a single underperforming property, we may be obligated to sell the property. if we were to exercise this remedy with respect to a large number of our seniors housing communities managed by sunrise, the dispositions could have a material adverse effect on us. 31 table of contents in the event that our management agreements with sunrise are terminated for any reason or are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we will have to find another manager for the properties covered by those agreements. we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that such manager will manage the properties as effectively as sunrise. any such inability or lengthy delay in replacing sunrise as manager following termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. we may not be able to realize the intended benefits of the sunrise reit acquisition, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the sunrise reit acquisition poses a number of risks, including the risks that: the acquired properties may not perform as well as we anticipated due to various factors, such as disruptions caused by the integration of operations with us and changes in economic conditions; because we do not manage the day-to-day operations of the acquired properties, we rely on sunrise to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner; and we may experience greater than expected costs and/or may not realize the expected revenues, cost savings or development opportunities from the transaction within the expected timeframe, if at all. if the liabilities we have assumed in the sunrise reit acquisition are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities relating to the sunrise reit properties, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we acquired our ownership interests in many of the sunrise reit properties through the acquisition of the entities that own these properties. these entities may be subject to liabilities unknown to us that, if asserted, could have a material adverse effect on us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with such entities; liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to the sunrise reit acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by such entities; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to the sunrise reit acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that the sunrise reit acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we have assumed are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the sunrise reit properties of which we were not aware at the time we completed the sunrise reit acquisition, our business could be materially and adversely affected. our current and future investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. through the sunrise reit acquisition and our resulting relationship with sunrise pursuant to a strategic alliance agreement, we have acquired a 75% to 85% ownership interest in 61 seniors housing communities, with the minority interests in those communities being owned by affiliates of sunrise. in addition, as of december 31, 2007, we owned seven mobs though joint ventures with partners who typically provide management and leasing 32 table of contents services for the properties. these joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may share decision-making authority with our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property held jointly thereby, such as the sale or financing of any such property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of any such property, which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners; prior consent of our joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture, which restricts our ability to dispose of our interests in the joint venture; our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture; our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and possibly disrupt the day-to-day operations of the property, such as delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we currently own twelve seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia. as a result, we are subject to fluctuations in u.s. and canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. as we increase our international presence through investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and/or healthcare-related assets outside the united states, we may transact additional business in currencies other than u.s. or canadian dollars. although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including borrowing in local currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. our revenues from the seniors housing communities managed by sunrise are dependent on private pay sources; events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our daily resident fees could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. assisted and independent living services currently are not generally reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. accordingly, substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our sunrise-managed properties are derived from private pay sources consisting of income or assets of residents or their family members. in general, because of the expense associated with building new properties and the staffing and other costs of providing services at these properties, only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our properties are located typically can afford to pay the daily resident and care fees. events such as economic downturns, changes in the housing market or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford these fees. if sunrise is unable to attract and retain seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. 33 table of contents overbuilding in markets in which our seniors housing communities are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. barriers to entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial. consequently, the development of new seniors housing communities could outpace demand. if the development of new seniors housing communities outpaces demand for those communities in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated. overbuilding in our markets, therefore, could cause us to experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. termination of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. applicable regulations governing assisted living communities generally require written resident lease agreements with each resident. most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident lease agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. consistent with these regulations, the resident lease agreements signed by sunrise with respect to our properties managed by it generally allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days notice. thus, sunrise cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements with terms of up to one year or longer. in addition, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if our units remained unoccupied, then our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. significant legal actions could subject our tenants, managers and operators to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operation. although claims and costs of professional liability insurance seem to be growing at a slower pace, our tenants, managers and operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of professional liability claims in recent years. in addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs attorneys continue to seek significant punitive damages and attorneys fees. due to historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain very high. as a result, the insurance coverage of our tenants, managers and operators might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. if our tenants, managers and operators are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. kindred insures its professional liability risks in part through a wholly owned, limited purpose insurance company. the limited purpose insurance company insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate limit. the limited purpose insurance company then insures all claims in excess of the aggregate limit for the unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. kindred maintains general liability insurance and professional malpractice liability insurance in amounts and with deductibles which kindred management has indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations. our tenants, managers and operators, including without limitation, kindred, that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the increase in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and we cannot assure you that these tenants , managers and operators reserves for future claims will be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. if 34 table of contents the actual cost of claims is significantly higher than the tenants , managers and operators reserves, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations at our properties operated by that tenant, manager or operator, the tenants , managers and operators liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make payments to us or on our behalf, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the operators liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we have assumed substantially all of provident liabilities, including contingent liabilities; if these liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are unknown provident obligations, our business could be materially and adversely affected. as a result of our acquisition of provident in 2005, we have assumed substantially all of provident liabilities, including contingent liabilities to which provident succeeded when it acquired the ownership interests in the properties that are currently leased to brookdale and alterra. we may learn additional information about provident business and liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with provident or the former property owners; liabilities, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to the provident acquisition, including periods prior to provident acquisition of the brookdale and alterra properties; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by provident or the former property owners; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to the provident acquisition, including taxes associated with the acquisition or prior ownership of the brookdale and alterra properties. as a result, we cannot assure you that the provident acquisition will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if provident liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of 35 table of contents provident of which we were not aware at the time we completed the acquisition, or if the provident acquisition fails to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code, it could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our capital structure we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2007, we had approximately $3.4 billion of indebtedness. our revolving credit facility, our canadian credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to incur substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our cost of borrowing. we may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments. in order to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments, we may need to raise additional capital. the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our revolving credit facility, our canadian credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. in addition, adverse economic conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable. in those circumstances, we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets or liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which could result in adverse tax consequences to us. moreover, certain healthcare regulations may constrain our ability to sell assets. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to continue to implement our business plan or to meet our debt service obligations, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. we have now, and may have in the future, exposure to floating interest rates, which could have the effect of reducing our profitability. we receive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk and can have the effect of reducing our profitability or making our lease and other revenue insufficient to meet our obligations. the amount of floating rate debt versus fixed rate debt we may incur is not limited. 36 table of contents risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. in addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations federal income taxation of ventas and requirements for qualification as a reit included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our reit status so long as the ratio of our debt to adjusted total assets (as each term is defined in the indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. however, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments. although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. this may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. in addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. 37 table of contents in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure we may be unable to raise additional capital necessary to continue to implement our business plan and to meet our debt payments. the terms of our revolving credit facility, our canadian credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions. the structure utilized to implement the sunrise reit acquisition may jeopardize our reit status. as a reit, we may not own and operate a healthcare facility directly, and a taxable reit subsidiary may not directly or indirectly manage or operate a healthcare facility. we believe (and have been advised by counsel) that a taxable reit subsidiary may own a healthcare facility if such facility is managed by an independent eligible contractor. in order to ensure that the sunrise reit acquisition does not jeopardize our reit status, the sunrise reit properties were acquired through taxable reit subsidiaries and are being managed by sunrise pursuant to long-term management agreements. we believe that the use of such a structure does not compromise our reit status. however, if it is determined that this structure jeopardizes our reit status, such determination could have a material adverse effect on us. we may still be subject to corporate level taxes. following our reit election and due to the acquisition of provident, we are considered to be a former c corporation for income tax purposes. therefore, we remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes for any additional kindred asset dispositions occurring before december 31, 2008. also, as a consequence of the provident acquisition, we remain potentially subject to corporate level taxes if we dispose of any of the brookdale properties before november 2014. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 62 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 62 table of contentsrisk factors 26 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our 26 table of contents securities. if any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. in that event, the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. we lease a substantial portion of our properties to kindred and brookdale senior living, and they are each a significant source of our total revenues and operating income. since the kindred master leases and our leases with brookdale senior living are triple-net leases, we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living not only for rental income, but also to pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could adversely affect its business reputation and ability to attract and retain patients and residents in its properties and also could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, kindred and certain subsidiaries of brookdale senior living, namely brookdale and alterra, have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. we cannot assure you that kindred or such subsidiaries of brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy these indemnification obligations. the properties managed by sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in sunrise business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. sunrise currently manages 79 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income. although we have various rights as owner under the sunrise management agreements, we rely on sunrise personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage our properties efficiently and effectively. we also rely on sunrise to set resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate those properties in accordance with the terms of our management agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on sunrise ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, and sunrise may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in these costs, which are included in the operating budget for each property, any failure by sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or any change in sunrise senior management could adversely affect the income we receive from these properties and have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any adverse developments in sunrise business and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate our properties efficiently and effectively could have a material adverse effect on us. as a result of the current economic and credit crisis and sunrise weakened financial condition, as disclosed in sunrise filings with the commission and other public announcements, sunrise may experience significant financial, legal, 27 table of contents accounting or regulatory difficulties, which could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, the inability to renew or extend its revolving credit facility, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings under the u.s. bankruptcy code by or against sunrise. any one or a combination of these events could have a material adverse effect on us. the severe weakening economy could adversely impact our operating income and earnings, as well as the results of operations of our tenants and operators, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. the united states is experiencing a recession which is nearing the longest duration since the great depression. continued concerns about the uncertainty over whether our economy will be adversely affected by inflation, deflation or stagflation, and the systemic impact of increased unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market and a severely distressed real estate market have contributed to increased market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence. this difficult operating environment could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs at our sunrise-managed properties, thereby reducing our operating income and earnings. it could also have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to maintain occupancy rates in our properties, which could harm their financial condition. if these economic conditions continue, we may experience operating deficiencies at our sunrise-managed properties and/or our tenants and operators may be unable to meet their rental payments and other obligations due to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors could become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements provide us with the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. in such a case, our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and it is quite likely that any claim we might have for unpaid rent would not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. if such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, would generally be more limited. similarly, if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in the event of an obligor bankruptcy, we may also be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g. real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant, operator or manager. we may be unable to reposition our properties on as favorable terms, or at all, if we have to replace any of our tenants or operators, and we may be subject to delays, limitations and expenses in repositioning our assets. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases upon the expiration of the terms thereof. if the kindred master leases, our leases with brookdale senior living or any of our other leases are not renewed, we would be required to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in certain circumstances, we could also exercise our right to replace any tenant or operator upon a default under the terms of the applicable lease. in case of non-renewal, our tenants are required to continue to perform all obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for any assets that are not renewed until expiration of the then current lease term. we generally have one year to arrange for the repositioning of non-renewed assets prior to the expiration of the lease term. if we exercise our right to replace a tenant upon a default under a 28 table of contents lease, during any period that we are attempting to locate a suitable replacement tenant or operator, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on those properties. we cannot assure you that we would be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases with new tenants or operators on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all. in this event, we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g. real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value and avoid the imposition of liens on properties while they are being repositioned. our ability to reposition our properties with another suitable tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. we could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. these delays, limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to reposition our properties, collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. our counterparties may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us due to the continued turmoil and uncertainty in the capital markets. as a result of current economic conditions, including turmoil and uncertainty in the capital markets, credit markets have tightened significantly such that the ability to obtain new capital has become more challenging and more expensive. in addition, several large financial institutions have either recently failed or become dependent on the assistance of the u.s. federal government to continue to operate as a going concern. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. similarly, if any of our other counterparties, such as letter of credit issuers, insurance carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow agents, experiences difficulty in accessing capital or other sources of funds or fails to remain a viable entity, it could have a material adverse effect on us. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate loan investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully reposition the properties, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under one of our mortgage loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan, as we are doing with respect to the sunwest loans, or protect our interest by acquiring title to the property and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property investment potential. the borrower may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. if the borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loans upon foreclosure, and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses. even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate loan investments, we may inherit properties that we are unable to expeditiously reposition with new tenants or operators, if at all, which would adversely affect our ability to recover our investment. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our operating assets that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our operating assets, including our sunrise-managed properties and our medical office buildings, that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs, thereby reducing our profitability. these risks include fluctuations 29 table of contents in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in costs of materials, energy, labor and services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims and the availability and costs of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies at our operating assets which could have a material adverse effect on us. we may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. investments in and acquisitions of these properties entail general risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, that the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. in addition, any new development projects that we pursue would be subject to risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the united states would also expose us to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency and tax risks. if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities, or both, to finance future investments, acquisitions or development activity, our leverage could increase or our per share financial results may be reduced. when we attempt to finance, acquire or develop properties, we compete with healthcare providers, other healthcare reits, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. our ability to compete successfully for investment and acquisition opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business objectives and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. even if we succeed in identifying and competing for such opportunities, we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to the properties or businesses we invest in or acquire, the investment or acquisition could divert management attention from our existing business, or the value of such investment or acquisition could decrease substantially, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, as we continue to implement our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets or businesses, we expect to increase the number of operators of our properties and, potentially, our business segments. we cannot assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such businesses. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in real estate in particular, seniors housing and healthcare properties. this concentration exposes us to all of the risks inherent in investments in real estate to a greater degree than if our portfolio was diversified, and these risks are magnified by the fact that our real estate investments are limited to properties used in the seniors housing or healthcare industries. if the current downturn in the real estate industry continues or intensifies, it could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a 30 table of contents price or on terms acceptable to us. a downturn in the seniors housing or healthcare industries could negatively impact our operating income and earnings, as well as our operators ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions will be limited. we cannot give any assurances that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past have had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which consequences may not have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators. our ability to invest in non-seniors housing or non-healthcare properties is restricted by the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, so these adverse effects may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside of seniors housing or healthcare. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement. over the last several years, the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like kindred, brookdale senior living and sunrise. the extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, and any changes in the regulatory framework could likewise have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators. kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit 31 table of contents payments to healthcare providers. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by kindred and our other tenants and operators which are currently being reimbursed by medicare, medicaid or private payors. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us. we have only limited rights to terminate our management agreements with sunrise, and we may be unable to replace sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we and sunrise are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. each management agreement has a term of 30 years, but may be terminated by us upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject in each case to sunrise rights to cure deficiencies. each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. in addition, if a minimum number of properties fail to achieve a targeted noi level for a given period, then we may terminate the management agreement on each property in such pool. this targeted noi level for each property is based upon an expected operating income projection set at the commencement of the management agreement for the applicable property, with such projection escalating annually. however, various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights. in the event that our management agreements with sunrise are terminated for any reason or are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we will have to find another manager for the properties covered by those agreements. we believe there are a number of qualified national and regional seniors care providers that would be interested in managing our sunrise-managed properties. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that such manager will manage the properties effectively. any such inability or lengthy delay in replacing sunrise as manager following termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. our current and future investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2008, we had a 75% to 85% ownership interest in 61 of our seniors housing communities, with the minority interests in those communities being owned by affiliates of sunrise. in addition, we owned eight medical office buildings through joint ventures with partners who typically provide management and leasing services for the properties. these joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be prevented from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners. as the managing member, we have authority to make all decisions for our sunrise joint ventures except for a limited set of major decisions, which generally include: (a) the merger or disposition of substantially all the assets of the joint venture; (b) the sale of additional interests in the joint venture; (c) the dissolution of the joint venture; (d) the disposition of a property owned by the joint venture; and (e) the acquisition of any real property by the joint venture. under our mob joint venture arrangements, we may share decision-making authority with our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the 32 table of contents ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property held jointly, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted. we can generally transfer our interest in the sunrise joint ventures, without consent, to anyone other than large seniors housing operators or their majority investors. prior consent of our mob joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in such joint ventures; our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture. generally, in our sunrise joint ventures, if either member fails to make a required capital contribution to a joint venture after notice and a cure period, the non-defaulting member may (i) revoke the capital contribution funding notice, (ii) advance to the joint venture the amount of the required capital contribution on behalf of the defaulting member in the form of a loan to the defaulting member, with all of the defaulting member subsequent distributions being applied to the loan until repayment in full, or (iii) advance the capital on behalf of the defaulting member with a recalculation of each member proportionate interest in the joint venture pursuant to the applicable formula in the agreements. many of our sunrise joint venture agreements provide for a punitive reduction in the defaulting member proportionate interest in the event of an advance of capital by a non-defaulting member pursuant to option (iii); our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and possibly disrupt the day-to-day operations of the property, such as delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we currently own twelve seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia. as a result, we are subject to fluctuations in u.s. and canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar will impact the amount of our net income. in addition, if we increase our international presence through investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and/or healthcare assets outside the united states, we may transact additional business in currencies other than u.s. or canadian dollars. although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. our revenues from the seniors housing communities managed by sunrise are dependent on private pay sources; events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our daily resident fees could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. by and large, assisted and independent living services currently are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. hence, substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our sunrise-managed properties are derived from private pay sources consisting of income or assets of residents or their family members. in general, due to the expense associated with building new properties and the staffing and other costs of providing services at these properties, only seniors with income or assets meeting 33 table of contents or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our properties are located typically can afford to pay the daily resident and care fees. the current economic downturn and decline in the housing market, as well as other events such as changes in demographics, could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford these fees. if sunrise is unable to attract and retain seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. overbuilding in markets in which our seniors housing communities are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. barriers to entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial. consequently, the development of new seniors housing communities could outpace demand. if the development of new seniors housing communities outpaces demand for those communities in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated. overbuilding in our markets, therefore, could cause us to experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. termination of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. applicable regulations governing assisted living communities generally require written resident lease agreements with each resident. most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident lease agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. consistent with these regulations, the resident lease agreements signed by sunrise with respect to our properties managed by it generally allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days notice. thus, sunrise cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements with terms of up to one year or longer. in addition, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if our units remained unoccupied, then our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. significant legal actions could subject our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operation. although claims and costs of professional liability insurance seem to be growing at a slower pace, our tenants, operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of professional liability claims in recent years. in addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs attorneys continue to seek significant punitive damages and attorneys fees. due to historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain very high. as a result, the insurance coverage of our tenants, operators and managers might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. kindred insures its professional liability risks, in part, through a wholly owned, limited purpose insurance company. the limited purpose insurance company insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate limit. the limited purpose insurance company then insures all claims in excess of the aggregate limit for the unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. kindred maintains general liability insurance and professional malpractice liability insurance in amounts and with deductibles which kindred management has indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations. our tenants, operators and managers, like kindred, that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional 34 table of contents liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and we cannot assure you that our tenants , operators and managers reserves for future claims will be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. if the actual cost of claims is significantly higher than the reserves, our tenants , operators and managers liquidity, results of operations and financial condition and the results of operations at our properties could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the operators liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain key personnel, and the loss of any one of them could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees. our future performance will be substantially dependent on our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot give any assurances that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. if the liabilities we have assumed in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we have assumed certain liabilities in connection with our past acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the seller and liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller; liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to our acquisition; 35 table of contents claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we have assumed are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the acquired properties of which we were not aware at the time we completed the acquisition, our business could be materially adversely affected. risks arising from our capital structure the recent and ongoing credit and liquidity crisis may limit our access to capital and have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan. in order to meet our debt payments, make distribution to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan, we may need to raise additional capital. recently, the global capital and credit markets have been experiencing a period of extraordinary turmoil and upheaval, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the u.s. federal government. this disruption in the credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for reits and other companies to access capital or other sources of funds. these conditions include greater stock price volatility, significantly less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency. it is difficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected. while we currently have no reason to believe that we will be unable to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities in the future, concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of borrowers specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease funding to borrowers. in addition, the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facilities might have incurred losses or might have reduced capital reserves on account of their prior lending to borrowers, their holdings of certain mortgage securities or their other financial relationships, in part because of the general weakening of the u.s. economy and the increased financial instability of many borrowers. as a result, these financial institutions might be or become capital constrained and might tighten their lending standards, or become insolvent. if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity, or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, these lenders might not be able or willing to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could also adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. our options for addressing such capital constraints would include without limitation (i) obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in our lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, (ii) accessing the public capital markets, (iii) obtaining secured loans from government-sponsored entities, pension funds or similar sources, (iv) decreasing or eliminating our distributions to our stockholders or paying taxable stock dividends and/or (v) delaying or ceasing our acquisition and investment activity. as with other public companies, the availability of debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading levels of our bonds and the market price of our common stock, which, in turn, depends upon various market conditions that change from time to time. among the market conditions and other factors that may affect our bond trading levels and the market price of our common stock is the market perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions 36 table of contents would likely adversely affect our bond trading levels and the market price of our common stock. if we cannot access capital or we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which could also result in adverse tax consequences to us. moreover, certain healthcare regulations may constrain our ability to sell assets. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2008, we had approximately $3.1 billion of indebtedness. our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to incur substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time we mortgage our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition and investment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement of libor, bankers acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, our interest costs for our existing floating rate debt and any new debt we incur would also increase. this increased cost could have the effect of reducing our profitability or making our lease and other revenues insufficient to meet our obligations, and could make the financing of any acquisition or investment activity more costly. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing. an increase in interest rates may also decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using hedging arrangements that involve risk, including the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we may earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may result in higher interest rates than we would otherwise have. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 37 table of contents covenants in our unsecured revolving credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and other debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and other debt instruments require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur indebtedness and operate in general is subject to compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from a breach of any of these covenants in our debt instruments, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. in addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our reit status so long as the ratio of our debt to adjusted total assets (as each term is defined in the indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. however, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments. 38 table of contents although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. this may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. in addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure the recent and ongoing credit and liquidity crisis may limit our access to capital and have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan. the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions. if we decide to pay taxable stock dividends to meet the reit distribution requirements, your tax liability may be greater than the amount of cash you receive. the irs has recently issued revenue procedure 2009-15. under this revenue procedure, the irs will treat stock dividends as distributions for purposes of satisfying the reit distribution requirements for calendar year 2009 if each stockholder can elect to receive the distribution in cash, even if the aggregate cash amount paid to all stockholders is limited, provided certain requirements are met. accordingly, if we decide to pay a stock dividend in accordance with revenue procedure 2009-15, your tax liability with respect to such dividend may be significantly greater than the amount of cash you receive. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 70 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset/liability management is incorporated by reference into this item 7a. 70 table of contentsrisk factors 26 risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. in that event, the value of our securities could decline. we have grouped these risk factors into three general categories: risks arising from our business; risks arising from our capital structure; and risks arising from our status as a reit. risks arising from our business we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. we lease a substantial portion of our properties to kindred and brookdale senior living, and they are each a significant source of our total revenues and operating income. since the kindred master leases and our leases with brookdale senior living are triple-net leases, we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living not only for rental income, but also to pay insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us. any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could adversely affect its business reputation and ability to attract and retain patients and residents in its properties and also could have a material adverse effect on us. moreover, kindred and certain subsidiaries of brookdale senior living, namely brookdale and alterra, have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. we cannot assure you that kindred or such subsidiaries of brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy these indemnification obligations. the properties managed by sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in sunrise business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. sunrise currently manages 79 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income. although we have various rights as owner under the sunrise management agreements, we rely on sunrise personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage our properties efficiently and effectively. we also rely on sunrise to set resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate those properties in 26 table of contents index to financial statements accordance with the terms of our management agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. for example, we depend on sunrise ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our seniors housing communities. a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, and sunrise may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in these costs, which are included in the operating budget for each property, any failure by sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or any change in sunrise senior management could adversely affect the income we receive from these properties and have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any adverse developments in sunrise business and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate our properties efficiently and effectively could have a material adverse effect on us. as a result of the current economic and credit crisis and sunrise weakened financial condition, as disclosed in sunrise filings with the commission and other public announcements, sunrise may experience significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, which could result in, among other adverse events, acceleration of its indebtedness, the inability to renew or extend its revolving credit facility, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings under the u.s. bankruptcy code by or against sunrise. any one or a combination of these events could have a material adverse effect on us. the severely weakened economy could adversely impact our operating income and earnings, as well as the results of operations of our tenants and operators, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. continued concerns about the uncertainty over whether our economy will be adversely affected by inflation, deflation or stagflation, and the systemic impact of increased unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market and a severely distressed real estate market have contributed to increased market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence. this difficult operating environment could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs at our sunrise-managed properties, thereby reducing our operating income and earnings. it could also have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to maintain occupancy and rates in our properties, which could harm their financial condition. these economic conditions could cause us to experience operating deficiencies at our sunrise-managed properties and/or cause our tenants and operators to be unable to meet their rental payments and other obligations due to us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. we face potential adverse consequences of bankruptcy or insolvency by our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors. we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors could become bankrupt or insolvent. although our lease, loan and management agreements provide us with the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. for example, a debtor-lessee may reject its lease with us in a bankruptcy proceeding. in such a case, our claim against the debtor-lessee for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap of the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and it is quite likely that any claim we might have for unpaid rent would not be paid in full. in addition, a debtor-lessee may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that its lease should be re-characterized as a financing agreement. if such a claim is successful, our rights and remedies as a lender, compared to a landlord, would generally be more limited. similarly, if a debtor-manager seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. in the event of an obligor bankruptcy, we may also be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant, operator or manager. 27 table of contents index to financial statements we may be unable to reposition our properties on as favorable terms, or at all, if we have to replace any of our tenants or operators, and we may be subject to delays, limitations and expenses in repositioning our assets. we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases upon the expiration of the terms thereof. if the kindred master leases, our leases with brookdale senior living or any of our other leases are not renewed, we would be required to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. in certain circumstances, we could also exercise our right to replace any tenant or operator upon a default under the terms of the applicable lease. in case of non-renewal, our tenants are required to continue to perform all obligations (including the payment of all rental amounts) for any assets that are not renewed until expiration of the then current lease term. we generally have one year to arrange for the repositioning of non-renewed assets prior to the expiration of the lease term. if we exercise our right to replace a tenant upon a default under a lease, during any period that we are attempting to locate a suitable replacement tenant or operator, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on those properties. we cannot assure you that we would be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases with new tenants or operators on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all. in this event, we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value and avoid the imposition of liens on properties while they are being repositioned. our ability to reposition our properties with another suitable tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing receivership, con or other laws, as well as by the medicare and medicaid change-of-ownership rules. we could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. these delays, limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to reposition our properties, collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us. our counterparties may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us due to the continued turmoil and uncertainty in the capital markets. continued turmoil and uncertainty in the capital markets and the tightening of the credit markets have made obtaining new capital more challenging and more expensive. interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our tenants, operators and managers to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. similarly, if any of our other counterparties, such as letter of credit issuers, insurance carriers, banking institutions, title companies and escrow agents, experiences difficulty in accessing capital or other sources of funds or fails to remain a viable entity, it could have a material adverse effect on us. we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate loan investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully reposition the properties, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. if a borrower defaults under any of our mortgage loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the property and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property investment potential. the borrower may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. if the borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loans upon foreclosure, and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses. even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate loan investments, we may inherit properties that we are unable to expeditiously reposition with new tenants or operators, if at all, which would adversely affect our ability to recover our investment. 28 table of contents index to financial statements we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our operating assets that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to various operational risks, liabilities and claims with respect to our operating assets, including our sunrise-managed properties and our mobs, that may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and/or increase our costs, thereby reducing our profitability. these risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in costs of materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) and services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims and the availability and costs of professional and general liability insurance. any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies at our operating assets which could have a material adverse effect on us. we may encounter certain risks when implementing our business strategy to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets. we intend to continue to pursue investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets domestically and internationally, subject to the contractual restrictions contained in our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. investments in and acquisitions of these properties entail general risks associated with any real estate investment, including risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, that the estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. in addition, any new development projects that we pursue would be subject to risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the risk of incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. investments in and acquisitions of properties outside the united states would also expose us to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, such as currency and tax risks. if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities, or both, to finance future investments, acquisitions or development activity, our leverage could increase or our per share financial results may be reduced. when we attempt to finance, acquire or develop properties, we compete with healthcare providers, other healthcare reits, healthcare lenders, real estate partnerships, banks, insurance companies, private equity and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. our ability to compete successfully for investment and acquisition opportunities is affected by many factors, including our cost of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates comparable to or better than our competitors. increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business objectives and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. see business competition included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. even if we succeed in identifying and competing for such opportunities, we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to the properties or businesses we invest in or acquire, the investment or acquisition could divert management attention from our existing business, or the value of such investment or acquisition could decrease substantially, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. as we invest in, and/or acquire or develop, additional seniors housing and/or healthcare assets or businesses, we expect that the number of operators of our properties and, potentially, our business segments will increase. we cannot assure you that we will have the capabilities to successfully monitor and manage a portfolio of properties with a growing number of operators and/or manage such businesses. moreover, in some cases, acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. successful integration of the operations of those companies will depend primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, 29 table of contents index to financial statements systems, procedures and personnel to eliminate redundancies and costs. potential difficulties we could encounter during integration include the loss of key employees, disruption of our business, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the assumption of unexpected liabilities. in addition, projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process could prove to be inaccurate. if we experience any of these difficulties, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to acquired companies, we might not achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our investments are concentrated in seniors housing and healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified. we invest primarily in real estate in particular, seniors housing and healthcare properties. this concentration exposes us to all of the risks inherent in investments in real estate to a greater degree than if our portfolio was diversified, and these risks are magnified by the fact that our real estate investments are limited to properties used in the seniors housing or healthcare industries. if the current downturn in the real estate industry continues or intensifies, it could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. a downturn in the seniors housing or healthcare industries could negatively impact our operating income and earnings, as well as our operators ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions will be limited. we cannot give any assurances that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and changes in government regulation and reimbursement in the past have had material adverse consequences on the industry in general, which consequences may not have been contemplated by lawmakers and regulators. we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation of healthcare will not have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry, including our seniors housing and healthcare operations, tenants and operators. our ability to invest in non-seniors housing or non-healthcare properties is restricted by the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, so these adverse effects may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real estate or outside of seniors housing or healthcare. our tenants, operators and managers may be adversely affected by increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement. over the last several years, the regulatory environment surrounding the long-term healthcare industry has intensified both in the amount and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. this is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like kindred, brookdale senior living and sunrise. the extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements which may be entered into by healthcare providers. changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in a significant increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions, including terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs, bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. 30 table of contents index to financial statements if our tenants, operators and managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be required to make significant changes to their operations. our tenants, operators and managers also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. in such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. we are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, and any changes in the regulatory framework could likewise have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators. kindred and certain of our other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the medicare and medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services to be provided by kindred and our other tenants and operators which are currently being reimbursed by medicare, medicaid or private payors. significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants and operators, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us. we have only limited rights to terminate our management agreements with sunrise, and we may be unable to replace sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed. we and sunrise are parties to long-term management agreements pursuant to which sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. each management agreement has a term of 30 years, but may be terminated by us upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject in each case to sunrise rights to cure deficiencies. each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise. in addition, if a minimum number of properties fail to achieve a targeted noi level for a given period, then we may terminate the management agreement on each property in such pool. this targeted noi level for each property is based upon an expected operating income projection set at the commencement of the management agreement for the applicable property, with such projection escalating annually. however, various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights. in the event that our management agreements with sunrise are terminated for any reason or are not renewed upon expiration of their terms, we will have to find another manager for the properties covered by those agreements. we believe there are a number of qualified national and regional seniors care providers that would be interested in managing our sunrise-managed properties. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate another suitable manager or, if we are successful in locating such a manager, that such manager will manage the properties effectively. any such inability or lengthy delay in replacing sunrise as manager following termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. 31 table of contents index to financial statements our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority regarding major decisions, our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners. as of december 31, 2009, we had 75% to 85% interests in 60 seniors housing communities owned in joint ventures with sunrise, and we had controlling interests in six mobs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide management and leasing services for the properties. these joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following: we may be prevented from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners. as the managing member or general partner, we have authority to make all decisions for our sunrise joint ventures except for a limited set of major decisions, which generally include: (a) the merger or disposition of substantially all the assets of the joint venture; (b) the sale of additional interests in the joint venture; (c) the dissolution of the joint venture; (d) the disposition of a property owned by the joint venture; and (e) the acquisition of any real property by the joint venture. under our mob joint venture arrangements, we may share decision-making authority with our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property; our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted. we can generally transfer our interest in the sunrise joint ventures, without consent, to anyone other than large seniors housing operators or their majority investors. prior consent of our mob joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in such joint ventures; our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture. generally, in our sunrise joint ventures, if either member fails to make a required capital contribution to a joint venture after notice and a cure period, the non-defaulting member may (i) revoke the capital contribution funding notice, (ii) advance to the joint venture the amount of the required capital contribution on behalf of the defaulting member in the form of a loan to the defaulting member, with all of the defaulting member subsequent distributions being applied to the loan until repayment in full, or (iii) advance the capital on behalf of the defaulting member with a recalculation of each member proportionate interest in the joint venture pursuant to the applicable formula in the agreements. many of our sunrise joint venture agreements provide for a punitive reduction in the defaulting member proportionate interest in the event of an advance of capital by a non-defaulting member pursuant to option (iii); our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property; disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and possibly disrupt the day-to-day operations of the property, such as delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved; and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments. 32 table of contents index to financial statements we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we currently own twelve seniors housing communities in the canadian provinces of ontario and british columbia. as a result, we are subject to fluctuations in u.s. and canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar will impact the amount of our net income. in addition, if we increase our international presence through investments in, and/or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and/or healthcare assets outside the united states, we may transact additional business in currencies other than u.s. or canadian dollars. although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. our revenues from the seniors housing communities managed by sunrise are dependent on private pay sources; events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our daily resident fees could cause our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations to decline. by and large, assisted and independent living services currently are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as medicare and medicaid. hence, substantially all of the resident fee revenues generated by our sunrise-managed properties are derived from private pay sources consisting of income or assets of residents or their family members. in general, due to the expense associated with building new properties and the staffing and other costs of providing services at these properties, only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our properties are located typically can afford to pay the daily resident and care fees. the current economic downturn and decline in the housing market, as well as other events such as changes in demographics, could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford these fees. if sunrise is unable to attract and retain seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with assisted and independent living services, our occupancy rates, resident fee revenues and results of operations could decline, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases and limits our uses of these properties and restricts our ability to sell or otherwise transfer such properties. we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. as the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us. in addition, many of our ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties and restrict our right to convey our interest in such ground leases, which may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties and impair their value. overbuilding in markets in which our seniors housing communities and mobs are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability. barriers to entry in the assisted living and mob industries are not substantial. consequently, the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs could outpace demand. if the development of new seniors housing communities or mobs outpaces demand for those asset types in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated. overbuilding in our markets, therefore, could cause us to experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability. termination of resident lease agreements could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. applicable regulations governing assisted living communities generally require written resident lease agreements with each resident. most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident lease agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. consistent with these regulations, the 33 table of contents index to financial statements resident lease agreements signed by sunrise with respect to our properties managed by it generally allow residents to terminate their lease agreements on 30 days notice. thus, sunrise cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements with terms of up to one year or longer. in addition, the resident turnover rate in our seniors housing communities may be difficult to predict. if a large number of resident lease agreements terminate at or around the same time, and if our units remained unoccupied, then our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers may not adequately insure against losses. we maintain and/or require in our existing leases and other agreements that our tenants, operators and managers maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. although we continually review the insurance maintained by us and our tenants, operators and managers and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost or that we or our tenants, operators and managers will be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance coverage. we also cannot give any assurances as to the future financial viability of our insurers or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. significant legal actions could subject our tenants, operators and managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operation. although claims and costs of professional liability insurance seem to be growing at a slower pace, our tenants, operators and managers continue to experience increases in both the number and size of professional liability claims. in addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs attorneys continue to seek significant punitive damages and attorneys fees. due to historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has been restricted and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain very high. as a result, the insurance coverage of our tenants, operators and managers might not cover all claims against them or continue to be available to them at a reasonable cost. if our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, they may be exposed to substantial liabilities. in addition, many healthcare providers are pursuing different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance programs that provide less insurance coverage. for example, kindred insures its professional liability risks, in part, through a wholly owned, limited purpose insurance company, which insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence with no aggregate coverage limit. coverage for losses in excess of those per occurrence levels is maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers up to an aggregate limit, and all claims in excess of the aggregate limit are then insured by the limited purpose insurance company. our tenants, operators and managers, like kindred, that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies which rely primarily on historical data. however, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. 34 table of contents index to financial statements as a result, the tenants, operators and managers of our properties could incur large funded and unfunded professional liability expense, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and, in turn, their ability to make rental payments under, or otherwise comply with the terms of, their leases with us or, with regard to our sunrise-managed properties, our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. our operators may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute. our operators who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. see governmental regulation healthcare regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. if any of these lawsuits were to be brought against our operators, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the operators liquidity, financial condition and results of operation and on their ability to make rental payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us. if any of our properties are found to be contaminated, or if we become involved in any environmental disputes, we could incur substantial liabilities and costs. under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. in certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. although we are generally indemnified by the current operators of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. see governmental regulation environmental regulation included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain key personnel, and the loss of any one of them could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees. our future performance will be substantially dependent on our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot give any assurances that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us. failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management assessment of the effectiveness of such control. changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any 35 table of contents index to financial statements failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. if the liabilities we have assumed in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if there are unknown liabilities, our business could be materially and adversely affected. we have assumed certain liabilities in connection with our past acquisitions, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities. as we integrate these acquisitions, we may learn additional information about the seller and liabilities that adversely affects us, such as: liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller; liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to our acquisition; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller; and liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. as a result, we cannot assure you that our past acquisitions will be successful or will not, in fact, harm our business. among other things, if the liabilities we have assumed are greater than expected, or if there are obligations relating to the acquired properties of which we were not aware at the time we completed the acquisition, our business could be materially adversely affected. risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan. in order to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan, we may need to raise additional capital. over the past few years, the global capital and credit markets have experienced a period of extraordinary turmoil and upheaval, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the u.s. federal government. this disruption in the credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created difficult conditions for reits and other companies to access capital or other sources of funds. these conditions include greater stock price volatility, significantly less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency. it is difficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected. while we currently have no reason to believe that we will be unable to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities in the future, concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of borrowers specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease funding to borrowers. in addition, the financial institutions that are parties to our unsecured revolving credit facilities might have incurred losses or might have reduced capital reserves on account of their prior lending to borrowers, their holdings of certain mortgage securities or their other financial relationships, in part because of the general weakening of the u.s. economy and the increased financial instability of many borrowers. as a result, these financial institutions might be or become capital constrained and might tighten their lending standards, or become insolvent. if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity, or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, these lenders might not be able or willing to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our 36 table of contents index to financial statements unsecured revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could also adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. our options for addressing such capital constraints would include without limitation (i) obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in our lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, (ii) accessing the public capital markets, (iii) obtaining secured loans from government-sponsored entities, pension funds or similar sources, (iv) decreasing or eliminating our distributions to our stockholders or paying taxable stock dividends, and/or (v) delaying or ceasing our acquisition and investment activity. as with other public companies, the availability of debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading levels of our bonds and the market price of our common stock, which, in turn, depends upon various market conditions that change from time to time. among the market conditions and other factors that may affect our bond trading levels and the market price of our common stock is the market perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and future earnings and cash distributions. our failure to meet the market expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect our bond trading levels and the market price of our common stock. if we cannot access capital or we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to realize the maximum return on those investments, which could also result in adverse tax consequences to us. restrictions on our uses and right to transfer our properties under certain healthcare regulations, ground leases, mortgages and other agreements to which our properties may be subject could adversely impact our ability to timely liquidate those investments and could impair the value of our properties. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the necessary capital to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. we may become more leveraged. as of december 31, 2009, we had approximately $2.7 billion of indebtedness. our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to incur substantial additional debt, and we may borrow additional funds, which may include secured borrowings. a high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to stockholders. a high level of indebtedness could also have the following consequences: potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate and/or healthcare industries; potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for our business strategy; and potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our cost of borrowing. in addition, from time to time we mortgage our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could have a material adverse effect on us. we are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition and investment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. we receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing our assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations, subject to certain limitations. certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest rate and related payments that vary with the movement 37 table of contents index to financial statements of libor, bankers acceptance or other indexes. the generally fixed rate nature of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our obligations create interest rate risk. although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, our interest costs for our existing floating rate debt and any new debt we incur would also increase. this increased cost could have the effect of reducing our profitability or making our lease and other revenues insufficient to meet our obligations, and could make the financing of any acquisition or investment activity more costly. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing. an increase in interest rates may also decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using hedging arrangements that involve risk, including the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we may earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may result in higher interest rates than we would otherwise have. moreover, no amount of hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. covenants in our unsecured revolving credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes, our mortgage loans and other debt instruments limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, our mortgage loans and other debt instruments require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and net worth requirements. our continued ability to incur indebtedness and operate in general is subject to compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from a breach of any of these covenants in our debt instruments, could have a material adverse effect on us. risks arising from our status as a reit loss of our status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. if we lose our status as a reit, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. in addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain reit status. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. 38 table of contents index to financial statements qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. in addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes. the 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. see certain u.s. federal income tax considerations requirements for qualification as a reit annual distribution requirements included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes permit us to make annual distributions to our stockholders in an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to maintain our reit status so long as the ratio of our debt to adjusted total assets (as each term is defined in the indentures) does not exceed 60% and to make additional distributions if we pass certain other financial tests. however, distributions may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our properties or subsequently acquired properties to finance investments, acquisitions or new developments. although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. this may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. in addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see risks arising from our capital structure limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan. the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some of these transactions. to preserve our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company. to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock or 9.0% of our common stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered to be excess shares and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our board of directors. the trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. we have the right to buy the excess shares for a purchase price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we buy the shares, but if we do not purchase them, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the excess shares at the direction of the board of directors. these ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 39 table of contents index to financial statements if we decide to pay taxable stock dividends to meet the reit distribution requirements, your tax liability may be greater than the amount of cash you receive. the irs has recently issued revenue procedure 2010-12. under this revenue procedure, the irs will treat stock dividends as distributions for purposes of satisfying the reit distribution requirements for calendar years 2008 through 2012 if each stockholder can elect to receive the distribution in cash, even if the aggregate cash amount paid to all stockholders is limited, provided certain requirements are met. accordingly, if we decide to pay a stock dividend in accordance with revenue procedure 2010-12, your tax liability with respect to such dividend may be significantly greater than the amount of cash you receive. quantitative and
