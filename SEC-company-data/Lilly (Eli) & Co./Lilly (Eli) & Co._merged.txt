risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful products to replace revenues of products losing patent protection. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market typically takes a decade or more and often costs well in excess of $1 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and payer reimbursement, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles of efficacy and safety for new product approvals; delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products. we face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic manufacturers. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic versions of our branded products, and by generic versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. see item 1, business competition, for more details. our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business will be adversely affected. our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our 16 human pharmaceutical patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, for more details. we face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, for more details. we depend on patent-protected products for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings, and we will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of them in the next several years. seven significant patent-protected products, which together composed 68 percent of our worldwide revenue in 2012, recently have lost, or will lose in the next several years, their most significant remaining u.s. patent protection and data-based protection, as well as their intellectual property-based exclusivity in most countries outside the united states: product worldwide revenues (2012) percent of total 2012 revenues loss of relevant u.s. exclusivity cymbalta $4.99 billion 22 december 2013 (compound patent plus pediatric exclusivity) alimta $2.59 billion 11 2017 (compound patent plus pediatric exclusivity); 2022 (vitamin dosage regimen patent plus pediatric exclusivity) humalog $2.40 billion 11 may 2013 cialis $1.93 billion 9 2017 zyprexa $1.70 billion 8 2011 evista $1.01 billion 4 march 2014 strattera $621.4 million 3 2017 outside the u.s., important patent or data package protection includes cymbalta in major european countries (data package protection until august 2014); alimta in major european countries (compound patent 2015; vitamin dosage regimen patent 2021); cialis in major european countries (compound patent 2017); and zyprexa in japan (compound patent 2015). loss of exclusivity, whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation, typically results in a rapid and severe decline in sales. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis financial condition, and item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, for more details. our human pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs. globally, governments are becoming increasingly aggressive in imposing health care cost-containment measures in response to budget deficit challenges. these measures can significantly affect our revenue and profitability. in many countries outside the u.s., government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, pricing, reimbursement, and patient access to our human pharmaceuticals. in the u.s., we are subject to substantial pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from state medicaid programs and private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, including those operating under the medicare part d pharmaceutical benefit, and implementation of u.s. health care reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures. in addition, many state legislative proposals would further negatively affect our pricing and reimbursement for, or access to, our products. globally, public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceuticals based on the payers' assessments of comparative effectiveness and value. we expect pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. to become more severe. see item i, business regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access, for more details. 17 pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns. unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining revenue, as well as costly product liability claims. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including lilly, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the cgmp issues. we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the u.s. department of health and human services that requires us to maintain comprehensive compliance programs governing our research, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of pharmaceuticals. a material failure to comply with the agreement could result in severe sanctions to the company. see item 1, business regulation of our operations, for more details. we face many product liability claims and are largely self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily byetta, zyprexa, diethylstilbestrol (des), darvon , and prozac. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data note 15, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to be largely self-insured for product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products. in addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters, or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. worsening economic conditions could adversely affect our business and operating results. while pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products. we have experienced delays in repayment from national health care systems in certain countries, including but not limited to greece and regions within spain and italy. the ongoing euro area financial crisis has heightened our sensitivity to such trends, and we continue to monitor the countries' and regions' creditworthiness. a prolonged economic downturn could also adversely affect our investment portfolio, which could lead to the recognition of losses on our corporate investments and increased benefit expense related to our pension obligations. also, if our customers, suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure; system inadequacies, operating failures, or security breaches could harm our business. we rely to a large 18 extent on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure. the size and complexity of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. likewise, confidentiality or data privacy breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that valuable trade secrets, personal information, or other sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. such information security breaches may be very difficult to detect. to date, system breakdowns and, to the extent we have been made aware of them, security breaches, have been infrequent in occurrence and their aggregate impact on our operations and expenses has not been material. while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely and materially affect our business. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we utilize third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, the manufacture and commercialization of certain products, support for information technology systems, and certain financial transactional processes. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us could adversely affect our business. unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income. changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and foreign tax audits, can affect our results of operations. the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the u.s. would tax the international income of u.s.-based companies. there have also been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the u.s. congress that could change the manner in and rate at which income of u.s. companies would be taxed. while it is uncertain how the u.s. congress may address u.s. tax policy matters in the future, reform of u.s. taxation, including taxation of international income, will continue to be a topic of discussion for the u.s. congress and the obama administration. a significant change to the u.s. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) in item 7 at management's discussion and analysis financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 39risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful products to replace revenues of products losing intellectual property protection. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market typically takes a decade or more and often costs well in excess of $1 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and payer reimbursement, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products; delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products. we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing 16 products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position and prospects. we face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic manufacturers. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. see item 1, business competition, for more details. we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those products in the next several years, which may result in rapid and severe declines in revenues. a number of our top-selling human pharmaceutical products recently have lost, or will lose in the next several years, significant patent protection and/or data protection in the u.s. as well as key countries outside the united states, as illustrated in the tables below: product u.s. revenues (2013) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues (2013) u.s. patent / data protection cymbalta $ 3,960.8 17% compound patent plus pediatric exclusivity december 2013 humalog 1,521.4 7% compound patent may 2013 alimta 1,209.1 5% compound patent plus pediatric exclusivity 2017;

if our intellectual property rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business will be adversely affected. our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld. we face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in sales. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data note 16, contingencies," for more details. our human pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs. the continuing prominence of u.s. budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies' revenue or increase expenses may be enacted. certain federal and state health care proposals, including state price controls, continue to be debated, and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices. the medicare independent payment advisory board established under the affordable care and patient protection act is empowered to recommend cost reduction policies under certain circumstances. these proposals, if implemented, could negatively affect revenues. international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. proposals for cost-containment measures are pending in a number of countries, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our intellectual-property protection. such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of continued austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries and the desire to manage health expenses carefully even as economies recover. in addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding the country's health care system offerings. some governments may adopt a generics-only policy which reduces current and future access to our human pharmaceutical products. others may use some of the approaches to restrict pricing, reimbursement and access outlined above. we expect pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. to become more severe. see item i, business regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access, for more details. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including lilly, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal and other health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the u.s. department of health and human services that requires us to maintain comprehensive compliance programs governing our research, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of pharmaceuticals. a material failure to comply with the agreement could result in severe sanctions to the company. see item 1, business regulation of our operations, for more details. 18 pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues. human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. after approval, the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients; we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products. in addition, we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. new safety or efficacy data from these sources may result in product label changes that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after approval for marketing could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims. we face many product liability claims and are self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily byetta , darvon , prozac, and actos . see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data note 16, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters, or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. in addition, given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. we depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business; system inadequacies or operating failures could harm our business. we rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced. these systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including energy or telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions, and random attacks. to date, system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. we have implemented extensive measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize the impact of system interruptions. however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business. unauthorized disclosures of our trade secrets and other confidential data could impair our valuable intellectual property, harm our competitive position, and expose us to regulatory penalties. a great deal of sensitive, confidential data is stored in our information systems and networks, including valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information (such as employee and patient information). some of this information is created, accessed, and/or maintained by third parties. the confidentiality of this information may be breached through malicious intrusions by private or governmental actors through human or electronic means, including hacking or cyber-attacks, or through negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and data. the rapid growth of social media exacerbates the risk of confidentiality breaches. unauthorized disclosure of trade secret information could impair our ability to secure and maintain patent rights and cause us to lose other competitive advantages. unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage the public trust in our company. breaches of our data 19 security may be very difficult to detect, and once detected, their impact may be very difficult to assess. to date, the data security breaches of which we have become aware have been infrequent in occurrence and, to the extent we have been able to measure their financial impact on our consolidated results of operations, such impact has not been material. we have invested and continue to invest to prevent, monitor, detect, and respond to data security breaches by strengthening our information technology systems, business processes, and training, and strengthening data protection requirements for third parties that hold our confidential information. however, despite these efforts, we expect data security breaches to continue, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent data security breaches that would have a material adverse effect on our business. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we utilize third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, the manufacture and commercialization of certain products, support for information technology systems, and certain financial transactional processes. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce results in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business. our animal health segment faces risks related to generic competition, food and animal safety concerns, factors affecting global agricultural markets, and other risks. the animal health operating segment may be impacted by, among other things, increased generic competition; emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals; perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products; increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing, or consumption of food-producing animals; an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals; adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets; and failure of the research and development, acquisition, and licensing efforts to generate new products. the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. worsening economic conditions could adversely affect our business and operating results. while human pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products. also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income. changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and foreign tax audits, can affect our results of operations. the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the u.s. would tax the international income of u.s.-based companies. there have also been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the u.s. congress that could change the manner in which, and rate at which, income of u.s. companies would be taxed. while it is uncertain how the u.s. congress may address u.s. tax policy matters in the future, reform of u.s. taxation, including taxation of international income, will continue to be a topic of discussion for the u.s. congress and the obama administration. a significant change to the u.s. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 20 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) in item 7 at management's discussion and analysis financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 43risk factors 18 risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products losing intellectual property protection. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market typically takes over a decade and often costs well in excess of $1 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products; delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products. we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position and prospects. 18 we face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with drugs. see item 1, business competition, for more details. we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those products in the next several years, which may result in rapid and severe declines in revenues. a number of our top-selling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost, or will lose in the next several years, significant patent protection and/or data protection in the united states (u.s.) as well as key countries outside the u.s., as illustrated in the tables below: product u.s. revenues (2014) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues (2014) patent / data protection - u.s. alimta $ 1,229.5 6% compound patent plus pediatric exclusivity 2017;

exclusivity (whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues. for biological products (such as humalog, humulin, and erbitux), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis executive overview other matters, and item 1, "business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights," for more details. 19 our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected. our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld. we face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in sales. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, item 3, "legal proceedings," and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data note 15, contingencies," for more details. our human pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs. in the u.s., prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals, congressional investigations into manufacturer's pricing policies, and the federal budget process continue to drive legislative debate. these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates or other federal measures may be enacted. as a result, pharmaceutical companies may see either a reduction in revenue or increase in expenses. president obama's fiscal year 2016 budget includes a number of key health legislative proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals, including a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to medicare parts b and d, and new language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in part d. savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund health care expenditures, such as the medicare sustainable growth rate, and non-health care expenditures. state and federal health care proposals, including price controls, continue to be debated, and if implemented could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations. in the u.s. private sector, the growth of managed care organizations (mcos) is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals. it is estimated that approximately two-thirds of the u.s. now participates in some form of managed care. mcos have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. mcos typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered under their plans. exclusion of a drug from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population. consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their branded products included. price is becoming an increasingly important factor in mco formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the mco has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of opera tions. international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. in addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products. we expect pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. to become more severe. see item i, business regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access, for more details. 20 unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates and results of operations. the u.s. and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the u.s. would tax the international income of u.s.-based companies, including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. there have also been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the u.s. congress that could change the manner in which, and rate at which, income of u.s. companies would be taxed. while it is uncertain how the u.s. congress may address u.s. tax policy matters in the future, reform of u.s. taxation, including taxation of international income, will continue to be a topic of discussion for the u.s. congress and the obama administration. additionally, the organisation for economic co-operation and development launched and continues to advance an initiative to analyze and potentially influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate. a significant change to the u.s. or international tax framework, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. see item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data note 13, income taxes," for more details. changes in foreign currency rates can significantly affect our revenue and income. as a global company with substantial operations outside the u.s., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the u.s. dollar against the euro, chinese yuan, and the japanese yen, and the british pound against the euro. while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including lilly, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal and other health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. see item 1, business regulation of our operations, for more details. pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues and income. human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. after approval, the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients; we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. in addition, we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after approval for marketing could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims. we face many product liability claims and are self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily byetta , prozac, and actos . see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data note 15, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or 21 other products in the future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters, or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. in addition, given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. we depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business; system inadequacies or operating failures could harm our business. we rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced. these systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including energy or telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions, and random attacks. to date, system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. we have implemented extensive measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize the impact of system interruptions. however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business. the loss, theft, or inadvertent disclosure of our confidential data could impair our valuable intellectual property, harm our competitive position, and expose us to regulatory penalties and other costs. a great deal of confidential information owned by both lilly and our alliances is stored in our information systems, networks, and facilities at third parties. this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information (such as employee and patient information). some of this information is created, accessed, and/or maintained by third parties. the confidentiality of this information may be breached in a variety of ways, including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and data, or wrongful conduct by certain governments, hackers, unethical competitors, or former workforce members. the rapid growth of social media exacerbates the risk of information security breaches. the theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights, cause damage to company operations and reputation, and cause us to lose other competitive advantages. unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage the public trust in our company. information security breaches may be very difficult to detect, and once detected, their impact may be very difficult to assess. to date, the information security breaches of which we have become aware have been infrequent in occurrence and, to the extent we have been able to measure their financial impact on our consolidated results of operations, such impact has not been material. we have invested and continue to invest to prevent, monitor, detect, and respond to information security breaches by strengthening our employee awareness and training, information technology systems, and business processes, and strengthening data protection requirements for third parties that handle our confidential information. however, despite these efforts, we expect information security breaches to continue, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent information security breaches that would have a material adverse effect on our business. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we utilize third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, the manufacture and commercialization of certain products, support for information technology systems, and certain financial 22 transactional processes. for example, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business. our animal health segment faces risks related to increased generic competition, food and animal safety concerns, factors affecting global agricultural markets, and other risks. the animal health operating segment may be impacted by, among other things, increased generic competition; increased sales of companion animal products by non-veterinarian retail outlets; emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals; perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products; increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing, or consumption of food-producing animals; an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals; adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets; and failure of the research and development, acquisition, and licensing efforts to generate new products. the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. integration of the newly-acquired novartis animal health business could be disruptive to operations, and if not done properly, could lead to a failure to achieve the intended benefits of the acquisition. we are in the process of integrating into our operations the novartis animal health business, which we purchased in january 2015. this global integration is complex and potentially disruptive to the ongoing operations of both the ongoing elanco business and the acquired novartis business. unexpected delays and difficulties in integrating the two businesses could lead to additional expenses, failure to achieve expected operating efficiencies and sales synergies, and disruption to ongoing operating results. worsening economic conditions could adversely affect our business and operating results. while human pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products. also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) in item 7 at management's discussion and analysis financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 49risk factors 19 risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products losing intellectual property protection. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $1 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products; delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products. we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and prospects. 19 we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those products in the next several years, which may result in rapid and severe declines in revenues. a number of our top-selling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost, or will lose in the next several years, significant patent protection and/or data protection in the u.s. as well as key countries outside the u.s., as illustrated in the tables below: product u.s. revenues (2015) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues (2015) patent / data protection - u.s. cialis $ 1,256.8 6% compound and use patents november 2017 alimta 1,162.4 6% compound patent plus pediatric

4% japan: data package protection 2018; formulation and related process patent 2019 certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. for non-biological products, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the u.s. historically, outside the u.s. the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the u.s.; however, generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the u.s., including japan, europe, and many countries in the emerging markets. for biological products (such as humalog, humulin, erbitux, and cyramza), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis executive overview other matters, and item 1, "business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights," for more details. our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected. our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. 20 intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major pharmaceutical products will be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings, and may not be upheld. we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in sales. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, item 3, "legal proceedings," and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data note 15, contingencies," for more details. our human pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for human pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medications. these pressures could negatively affect our future revenues and income. in the u.s., public concern over prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals continues to drive the legislative debate. these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates or other federal and state measures may be enacted. key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to medicare parts b and d, new language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in part d, and state-level proposals to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs. savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and non-health care initiatives, or to manage federal and state budgets. in the u.s. private sector, health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. payers typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered and the cost to the consumer. non-preferred formulary placement, including the exclusion of a drug from a formulary, typically leads to its reduced usage in the patient population. consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to have their branded products included by, among other things, providing offsetting rebates. price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which payers take the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act (aca) are now in effect through both the launch of state-based exchanges and the expansion of medicaid. an emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high patient out-of-pocket costs for pharmaceuticals. in addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market, driven in part by aca changes such as the 2020 implementation of the excise tax on employer-sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit (the so-called "cadillac tax"), continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. at the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards quality-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives are placing demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile. international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. in addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products. we expect pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. to become more severe. for more details, see item 1, business regulations affecting human pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access, and item 7, management's discussion and analysis executive overview other matters. 21 we face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with drugs. see item 1, business competition, for more details. changes in foreign currency rates can materially affect our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. as a global company with substantial operations outside the u.s., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the u.s. dollar against the euro, japanese yen, and british pound, and the british pound against the euro. while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. the u.s. and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard. for example, the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the u.s. would tax the international income of u.s.-based companies, including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. other tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the u.s. congress could change the tax rate and manner in which u.s. companies would be taxed. additionally, the organisation for economic co-operation and development issued its final recommendations of international tax reform proposals to influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate. while outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain, changes to key elements of the u.s. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows. see item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data note 13, income taxes," for more details. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including us, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal and other health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. see item 1, business regulation of our operations, for more details. the loss, theft, or inadvertent disclosure of our confidential data could impair our valuable intellectual property, harm our competitive position, and/or expose us to regulatory penalties and other costs. a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our alliances is stored in our information systems, networks, and facilities or those of third parties. this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information (such as employee and patient information). some of this information is created, accessed, and/or maintained by third parties. the confidentiality of this information may be breached in a variety of ways, including but not limited to negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with 22 permitted access to our systems and data, or wrongful conduct by certain governments, hackers, unethical competitors, or former workforce members. the rapid growth of factors such as mobile computing capacity, high-speed internet access, and social media exacerbates the risk of information security breaches. the theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights, cause damage to company operations and reputation, and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages. unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage the public trust in our company. information security breaches may be very difficult to detect, and once detected, their impact may be very difficult to assess. to date, the information security breaches of which we have become aware have been infrequent in occurrence and, to the extent we have been able to measure their financial impact on our consolidated results of operations, such impact has not been material. we have invested and continue to invest to prevent, monitor, detect, and respond to information security breaches by strengthening our employee awareness and training, information technology systems, and business processes, and strengthening data protection requirements for third parties that handle our confidential information. however, despite these efforts, we expect information security breaches to continue, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent information security breaches that would have a material adverse effect on our business. worsening economic conditions could adversely affect our business and operating results. while human pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers,

product label changes that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims. we face many product liability claims and are self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos , byetta , cymbalta, and prozac among other products. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data note 15, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters, mechanical or information technology system failures, or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. in addition, given 23 the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. we depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business; system inadequacies or operating failures could harm our business. we rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced. these systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to corruption, damage, or interruption from a variety of sources, including energy or telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions, and random attacks. to date, system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. we have implemented measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize the impact of system interruptions. however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we utilize third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, the manufacture and commercialization of certain products, support for information technology systems, and certain financial transactional processes. for example, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business. our animal health segment faces risks related to increased generic competition, food and animal safety concerns, factors affecting global agricultural markets, and other risks. the animal health operating segment may be impacted by, among other things, increased generic competition; increased sales of companion animal products by non-veterinarian retail outlets; emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals; perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products; increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing, or consumption of food-producing animals; an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals; adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets; and failure of our research and development, acquisition, and licensing efforts to generate new products. the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income. integration of the novartis animal health business could lead to additional unplanned expenses and be disruptive to operations. we are continuing to integrate into our operations the novartis ah business which we purchased in january 2015. this complex global integration is a multi-year process and could still be disruptive to the ongoing operations of the elanco business or to certain corporate support functions. unexpected delays and difficulties in the integration could lead to additional expenses and disruption to ongoing operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) in item 7 at management's discussion and analysis financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 53risk factors 17 risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion (dimasi ja, grabowski hg, hansen ra. innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: new estimates of r&amp;d costs, journal of health economics 2016;47:20-33.). failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory 17 agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products; delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products. we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and prospects. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis executive overview late-stage pipeline, for more details. we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those products in the next several years, which has resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe declines in revenues. a number of our top-selling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost, or will lose in the next several years, significant patent protection and/or data protection in the u.s. as well as key countries outside the u.s., as illustrated in the tables below: product u.s. revenues (2016) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues

effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. for non-biologic products, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the u.s. historically, outside the u.s. the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the u.s.; however, generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the u.s., including japan, europe, and many countries in the emerging markets. for biologic (such as humalog, humulin, erbitux, cyramza, trulicity, and taltz), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. see item 7, management's discussion and 18 analysis executive overview other matters, and item 1, "business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights," for more details. our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected. our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our human pharmaceutical patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings, and may not be upheld. in addition, a new ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatch-waxman act. as a result, our patents may be invalided via this review process. although such a decision can be appealed to the courts, in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market, while a win provides no precedential value -- the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors. we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, item 3, "legal proceedings," and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data note 15, contingencies," for more details. our human pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for human pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medications. these pressures could negatively affect our future revenues and net income. we expect pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. to become more severe. for more details, see item 1, business regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access, and item 7, management's discussion and analysis executive overview other matters. we face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs. see item 1, business competition, for more details. changes in foreign currency rates or devaluation of a foreign currency can materially affect our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. as a global company with substantial operations outside the u.s., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates. while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency, the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis financial condition for more details. 19 unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. the u.s. and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard. changes to key elements of the u.s. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis executive overview other matters and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data note 13, income taxes," for more details. failure, inadequacy, or breach of our information technology systems, infrastructure, and business information could result in material harm to our business and reputation. a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our alliances is stored in our information systems, networks, and facilities or those of third parties. this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, such as employee and patient information (collectively, confidential information ). we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and infrastructure (together it systems ), some of which are within the company's control and some of which are within the control of third parties, to accumulate, process, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business. it systems are potentially vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources. cyber- attacks are growing in their frequency, sophistication , and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, mitigate, or prevent. cyber-attacks come in many forms, including the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service attacks, the use of social engineering , and other means to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our it systems , confidential information, and other data. breaches resulting in the loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information can occur in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information, or wrongful conduct by hackers, competitors, certain governments, or other current or former company personnel. our third party partners face similar risks . the failure or inadequacy of our it systems or the loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights, damage our operations, customer relationships, and reputation, and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages. unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations and could damage public trust in our company. to date, system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, cyber-attacks, and the loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. we have implemented measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize these risks . however, these measures may not be successful. if they are not successful, any of these events could result in material financial, legal, business, or reputational harm to our business and reputation. 20 significant economic downturns could adversely affect our business and operating results. while human pharmaceuticals and companion animal health products have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products, affecting our sales volume. our food animal business may be affected by depressed prices for our customers' end products. declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce human health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products. also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. similarly, in the event of a significant economic downturn, we could have difficulty accessing credit markets. pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues and income. human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. after approval, the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients; we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. in addition, we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims. we face many product liability claims and are self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos , axiron, byetta , cialis, cymbalta, and prozac among other products. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data note 15, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including us, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal and other health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. see item 1, business government regulation of our operations, for more details. 21 manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters, mechanical or information technology system failures, or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. in addition, given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting demand for new products. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we utilize third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, manufacture, commercialization, support for information technology systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. for example, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business. our animal health segment faces risks related to increased generic competition, food and animal safety concerns, factors affecting global agricultural markets, and other risks. the animal health operating segment may be impacted by, among other things, increased sales of companion animal products by non-veterinarian retail outlets; emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals; perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products; increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing, or consumption of food-producing animals; an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals; adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets; and failure of our research and development, acquisition, and licensing efforts to generate new products. the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income. 22 quantitative and

voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims. we face many product liability claims and are self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos , axiron , byetta , cialis, cymbalta, and prozac among other products. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 15, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including us, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible that we could become subject to such investigations and that the outcome could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal and other health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. see item 1, business - government regulation of our operations, for more details. 22 manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters, mechanical or information technology system failures, or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. in addition, given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products. see item 1, business - raw materials and product supply, for more details. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we utilize third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, manufacture, commercialization, support for information technology systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. for example, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business. our animal health segment faces risks related to increased generic competition, food and animal safety concerns, factors affecting global agricultural markets, and other risks. the animal health operating segment may be impacted by, among other things, emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals; perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products; increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing, or consumption of food-producing animals; an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals; adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets; and failure of our research and development, acquisition, and licensing efforts to generate new products. the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) at item 7, management's discussion and analysis - financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 52risk factors 18 risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products. we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and prospects. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - late-stage pipeline, for more details. 18 we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those products in the next several years, which has resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe declines in revenues. a number of our top-selling human pharmaceutical products have recently lost, or will lose in the next several years, significant patent protection and/or data protection in the u.s. as well as key countries outside the u.s., as illustrated in the tables below: product u.s. revenues (2018) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues (2018) patent / data protection - u.s. alimta 1,131.0 5% vitamin regimen patent plus pediatric exclusivity will expire in 2022 cialis 1,129.2 5% compound patent plus pediatric exclusivity expired in may 2018 and unit dose patent expired in september 2018 forteo 757.9 3% formulation and related process patents expired in december 2018 and use patents will expire in august 2019 product revenues outside u.s. (2018) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues (2018) patent / data protection - major europe / japan alimta $ 1,001.9 4% major european countries: vitamin regimen patent will expire in 2021 japan: use patents to treat cancer concomitantly with vitamins will expire in 2021 forteo 817.7 3% japan: data package protection expired in july 2018; formulation and use patents will expire in august 2019 cymbalta 653.7 3% japan: data package protection will expire in january 2020 certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. for non-biologic products, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the u.s. historically, outside the u.s. the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the u.s.; however, generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the u.s., including japan, europe, and many countries in the emerging markets. for biologics (such as humalog, humulin, erbitux, cyramza, trulicity, taltz, and emgality), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. in addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - other matters - patent matters, and item 1, "business - patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights," for more details. our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected. our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. 19 intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., in addition to the process for challenging patents which applies to our biologic products, the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other human pharmaceutical patents. as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceedings, and may not be upheld. in addition, a separate ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatch-waxman act. our patents may be invalidated via this review process. although such a decision can be appealed to the courts, in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market, while a win provides no precedential value - the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors. we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business - patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, item 3, "legal proceedings," and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data - note 15, contingencies," for more details. our human pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business. public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for human pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medications. these pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income. we expect pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. to become more severe. for more details, see item 1, business - regulations and private payer actions affecting human pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access, and item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - other matters - trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access. we face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs. see item 1, business - competition and "business - research and development," for more details. changes in foreign currency rates or devaluation of a foreign currency can materially affect our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. as a global company with substantial operations outside the u.s., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates. while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency, the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - financial condition for more details. 20 unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. the u.s. enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising the u.s. tax law, effective january 2018, and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes. modifications to key elements of the u.s. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - other matters and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data - note 13, income taxes," for more details. failure, inadequacy, or breach of our information technology systems, infrastructure, and business information or violations of data protection laws could result in material harm to our business and reputation. a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our business partners is stored in our information systems, networks, and facilities or those of third parties. this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, clinical trial information, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, such as employee and patient information (collectively, confidential information ). we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure, and hardware (together it systems ), some of which are within the company's control and some of which are within the control of third parties, to accumulate, process, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business. it systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources. cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency, sophistication , and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, mitigate, or prevent. cyber-attacks come in many forms, including the deployment of harmful malware, exploitation of vulnerabilities, denial-of-service attacks, the use of social engineering , and other means to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our it systems , confidential information, and other data. breaches resulting in the compromise, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our products and services, can occur in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information, or wrongful conduct by hackers, competitors, certain governments, or other current or former company personnel. our third party partners face similar risks . the failure or inadequacy of our it systems, the compromise, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems, could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights; result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure, or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems; damage our operations, customer relationships, or reputation; or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages. unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company. to date, system inadequacies, operating failures, unauthorized access, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, cyber-attacks, and the compromise, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. we have implemented measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks; however, these measures may not be successful. if they are not successful, any of these events could result in material financial, legal, business, or reputational harm to our business . 21 significant economic downturns or international trade disruptions or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results. while human pharmaceuticals and companion animal health products have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products, affecting our sales volume. our food animal business may be affected by depressed prices for our customers' end products. declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce human health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products. also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. similarly, in the event of a significant economic downturn, we could have difficulty accessing credit markets. significant portions of our business are conducted in europe, including the u.k.; asia; and other international geographies. interruptions in international relationships such as the current negotiations between u.k. and the eu on the u.k.'s exit from the eu ( brexit ), and trade disputes such as the current trade negotiations between the u.s. and china, could result in changes to regulations governing our products and our intellectual property, or otherwise affect our ability to do business. while we do not expect either circumstance to materially affect our business in a direct manner, these and similar events could adversely affect us, or our business partners or customers. pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues and income. human pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. after approval, the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients; we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. in addition, we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims. we face many product liability claims and are self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos , axiron , byetta , cialis, and cymbalta among other products. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 15, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future, which require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of human pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including us, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. we are and could in the future become subject to such investigations, the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal and other health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. see item 1, business - government regulation of our operations, for more details. 22 manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters; mechanical or information technology system vulnerabilities, such as system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. in addition, given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products. see item 1, business - raw materials and product supply, for more details. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we rely on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, manufacture, commercialization, support for information technology systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. for example, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our proprietary information; or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business. our animal health segment faces risks related to increased generic competition, food and animal safety concerns, factors affecting global agricultural markets, and other risks. the animal health segment may be impacted by, among other things, emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals; perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products; increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing, or consumption of food-producing animals; an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals; adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; adverse global economic conditions affecting agricultural markets; and failure of our research and development, acquisition, and licensing efforts to generate new products. the failure to manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income. we may not realize the anticipated value or tax treatment for the divestiture of our interest in elanco. there are uncertainties and risks related to the timing and potential value to elanco, lilly, and our and their shareholders of the planned separation of the elanco animal health business, including business, industry, and market risks, as well as risks involving realizing the anticipated tax-free nature of the separation. failure to implement the separation effectively could result in a lower value to lilly and to shareholders. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) at item 7, management's discussion and analysis - financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 52risk factors 17 risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products. we cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - late-stage pipeline, for more details. we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those products in the next several years, which has resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe declines in revenues. a number of our top-selling products have recently lost, or will lose in the next several years, significant patent protection and/or data protection in the u.s. as well as key countries outside the u.s., as illustrated in the tables below: product u.s. revenues (2019) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues (2019) patent / data protection - u.s. alimta $ 1,219.5 5% vitamin regimen patent plus pediatric exclusivity will expire in may 2022 forteo 645.5 3% formulation and related process patents expired in december 2018 and use patents expired in august 2019 17 product revenues outside u.s. (2019) ($ in millions) percent of worldwide revenues (2019) patent / data protection - major europe / japan alimta $ 896.4 4% major european countries: vitamin regimen patent will expire in june 2021 japan: use patents to treat cancer concomitantly with vitamins will expire in june 2021 forteo 759.1 3% japan: data package protection expired in july 2018; formulation and use patents expired in august 2019 cymbalta 675.8 3% japan: data package protection expired in january 2020 certain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. for non-biologic products, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the u.s. historically, outside the u.s. the market penetration of generics following loss of exclusivity has not been as rapid or pervasive as in the u.s.; however, generic market penetration is increasing in many markets outside the u.s., including japan, europe, and many countries in the emerging markets. for biologics (such as humalog, humulin, erbitux, cyramza, trulicity, taltz, and emgality), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors including development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties in the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. in addition, competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - other matters - patent matters, and item 1, "business - patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights," for more details. our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be adversely affected. our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time, depending on local laws and regulations. changes to such laws and regulations could reduce protections for our innovative products. in the u.s., in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the bpci act, which applies to our biologic products, the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our other pharmaceutical patents. as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major pharmaceutical products will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. in addition, a separate ipr process allows competitors to request review of issued patents by the uspto without the protections of the hatch-waxman act. our patents may be invalidated via this review process. although such a decision can be appealed to the courts, in certain circumstances a loss in such a proceeding could result in a competitor entering the market, while a win provides no precedential value - the same patent can still be challenged by other competitors. we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business - patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, item 3, "legal proceedings," and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data - note 16, contingencies," for more details. 18 our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business. public and private payers are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medications. these pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income. we expect pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. to become more severe. for more details, see item 1, business - regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access, and item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - other matters - trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access. we face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world. particularly for biosimilars, changes to such regulations could make it easier, less expensive, and less time consuming for competitor products to enter the market, some of which could be substituted for our products at the pharmacy. our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs. see item 1, business - competition and "business - research and development," for more details. changes in foreign currency rates or devaluation of a foreign currency can materially affect our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. as a global company with substantial operations outside the u.s., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates. while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency, the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - financial condition for more details. unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our income taxes and decrease our net income. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and in the course of our business, we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events, including the separation of elanco. changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, as well as events that differ from our expectations, could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. the u.s. enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising the u.s. tax law, effective january 2018, and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes. modifications to key elements of the u.s. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis - results of operations - executive overview - other matters - tax matters and item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data - note 14, income taxes," for more details. lilly has taken the position on the separation from elanco, based on an opinion of tax counsel, that the divestiture of elanco common stock qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if any facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from lilly and elanco regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the divestiture may not qualify for tax-free treatment, which could result in significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities for both lilly and its shareholders who exchanged their stock for elanco stock. 19 failure, inadequacy, or breach of our information technology systems, infrastructure, and business information or violations of data protection laws could result in material harm to our business and reputation. a great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our business partners is stored in our information systems, networks, and facilities or those of third parties. this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, clinical trial information, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, such as employee and patient information (collectively, confidential information ). we also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure, and hardware (together it systems ), some of which are within the company's control and some of which are within the control of third parties, to accumulate, process, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy, data protection, and data security. maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business. it systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources. cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency, sophistication , and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, mitigate, or prevent. cyber-attacks come in many forms, including the deployment of harmful malware, exploitation of vulnerabilities, denial-of-service attacks, the use of social engineering , and other means to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our it systems , confidential information, and other data. breaches resulting in the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our products and services, can occur in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information, or wrongful conduct by hackers, competitors, certain governments, or other current or former company personnel. our third party partners face similar risks . the failure or inadequacy of our it systems, the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems, could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights; result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure, or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems; damage our operations, customer relationships, or reputation; and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages. unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company. to date, system inadequacies, operating failures, unauthorized access, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, cyber-attacks, and the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. we maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our it systems. we continue to implement measures in an effort to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our it systems; however, these measures may not be successful. if they are not successful, any of these events could result in material financial, legal, business, or reputational harm to our business. 20 significant economic downturns or international trade disruptions or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results. while pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, prolonged economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products, affecting our sales volume. declining tax revenues attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products. also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. similarly, in the event of a significant economic downturn, we could have difficulty accessing credit markets. significant portions of our business are conducted in europe, including the u.k.; asia; and other international geographies. trade disputes and interruptions in international relationships, including pandemic diseases, such as the coronavirus, could result in changes to regulations governing our products and our intellectual property, or otherwise affect our ability to do business. while we do not expect either circumstance to materially affect our business in a direct manner, these and similar events could adversely affect us, or our business partners or customers. pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues, income, and reputation. pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. after approval, the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients; we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace. in addition, we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining sales. serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. safety issues could also result in costly product liability claims. we face litigation and investigations related to our products and our pricing practices and are self-insured; we could face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving actos , axiron , byetta , cialis, and cymbalta among other products, as well as litigation and investigations related to the pricing of our products. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 16, contingencies, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation, as well as pricing litigation, investigations, and inquiries. because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we are and could in the future become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products, or to further litigation or investigations into pricing or other commercial practices. such matters require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product. due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products, as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters. 21 regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including us, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. we are and could in the future become subject to such investigations, the outcomes of which could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from u.s. federal and other health care programs. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp regulations (and comparable foreign regulations) for our products can lead to product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the issues. see item 1, business - government regulation of our operations, for more details. manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost revenue. such difficulties or disruptions could result from quality or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters or pandemic disease; mechanical or information technology system vulnerabilities, such as system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; or inability to obtain sole-source raw or intermediate materials. in addition, given the difficulties in predicting sales of new products and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, it is possible that we could have difficulty meeting unanticipated demand for new products. see item 1, business - raw materials and product supply, for more details. reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business. we rely on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, manufacture, commercialization, support for information technology systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. for example, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of our clinical trials to contract research organizations. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our confidential and proprietary information; may experience disruption or fail to perform due to information technology system vulnerabilities, breaches, or cyber-attacks; or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, privacy, security, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) at item 7, management's discussion and analysis - financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 50risk factors; cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. we make certain forward-looking statements in this form 10-k, and company spokespersons may make such statements in the future. where possible, we try to identify forward-looking statements by using such words as expect, plan, will, estimate, forecast, project, believe, and anticipate . forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. they are likely to address our growth strategy, sales of current and anticipated products, financial results, our research and development programs, the status of product approvals, legislative and regulatory developments, and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations. all forward-looking statements are based on our expectations at the time we make them. they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those summarized below. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market typically takes a decade or more and costs over $1 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in recent years, fda review times have increased substantially and fewer new drugs are being approved. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products. we face intense competition. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product sales can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic versions of our branded products, and by generic versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. see item 1, business competition, for more details. we depend on patent-protected products for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings, and we will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of them in the next several years. eight significant products, which together comprise 74 percent of our worldwide revenue, will lose their 11 most significant remaining u.s. patent protection, as well as their intellectual property-based exclusivity in most countries outside the u.s., in the next several years: worldwide revenues percent of total product (2009) 2009 revenues relevant u.s. patent protection zyprexa $4.92 billion 23 2011 cymbalta $3.07 billion 14 2013 humalog $1.96 billion 9 2013 alimta $1.71 billion 8 2016 cialis $1.56 billion 7 2017 gemzar $1.36 billion 6 2010 (compound); 2013 (use) 1 evista $1.03 billion 5 2014 (use); 2017 (dosage form) 1 strattera $609.4 million 3 2016 1 the gemzar use patent and evista dosage form patent have been held invalid by federal district courts, and we have appealed those decisions. for more information, see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters. loss of exclusivity typically results in a rapid and severe decline in sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property protection, for more details. additionally, if these or other significant products were to become subject to a problem such as an early loss of patent protection as a result of litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, material product liability litigation, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, or pressure from competitive products, the adverse impact on our revenues, cash flows, and earnings could be significant. our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection . our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major products will be routinely challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property protection, for more details. we are increasingly facing generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property protection, for more details. our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other health care cost containment measures. government health care cost-containment measures can significantly affect our sales and profitability. in many countries outside the united states, government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which our products are sold. in the united states, we are subject to substantial pricing pressures from state medicaid programs and private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, including those operating under the medicare part d pharmaceutical benefit. many federal and state legislative proposals, including the comprehensive health care reform bills that were the subject of recent debate in congress, would further negatively affect our pricing and/or reimbursement for our products. we expect pricing pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the united states to become more severe. see item i, business regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, for more details. pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns. unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as costly product liability claims. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many 12 companies, including lilly, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities and private payers and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible other products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. in particular, see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters, for the discussions of the u.s. sales and marketing practices investigations. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the cgmp issues. we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the u.s. department of health and human services that requires us to maintain comprehensive compliance programs governing our research, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of pharmaceuticals. a material failure to comply with the agreement could result in severe sanctions to the company. see item 1, business regulation of our operations, for more details. we face many product liability claims today, and future claims will be largely self-insured. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily zyprexa, diethylstilbestrol ( des ), thimerosal, and byetta, and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for other products in the future. see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to be largely self-insured for future product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products. in addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. manufacturing difficulties could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost sales. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. a prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our business and operating results. while pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, a prolonged economic downturn coupled with rising unemployment (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population) could lead to decreased utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. declining tax revenues attributable to the downturn are increasing the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. in addition, a prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our investment portfolio, which could lead to the recognition of losses on our corporate investments and increased benefit expense related to our pension obligations. also, if our customers, suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. we face other risks to our business and operating results. our business is subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including: economic factors over which we have no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, can affect our results of operations. changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and foreign tax audits, can affect our results of operations. in its budget submission to congress in february 2010, the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the u.s. would tax the international income of u.s.-based companies. while it is uncertain how the u.s. congress may address this issue, reform of u.s. taxation, including taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of discussion for the u.s. congress. a significant change to the u.s. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. changes in accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission can affect our financial statements. our financial statements can also be affected by internal factors, such as changes in business strategies and the impact of restructurings, asset impairments, technology acquisition and disposition transactions, and business combinations. we undertake no duty to update forward-looking statements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) in item 7 at management

face intense competition. we compete with large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product sales can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded

investments in research and development, capital, and other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. we currently expect no major patent expirations in this decade, but several major products will lose intellectual property protection in the first half of the next decade. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major products will be routinely challenged, and

pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement for more details. pharmaceutical research and development is costly and uncertain. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in new product development and introduction of new products. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products. pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns. unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability claims. 12 table of contents zyprexa contributes a major portion of our sales and earnings. zyprexa, our largest-selling product, contributes a significant proportion of our total sales and income, and we believe zyprexa will continue to be a major contributor to our sales and earnings for several years. an unexpected steep and extended decline in zyprexa sales (resulting from, for example, an unexpected safety or efficacy concern, regulatory action, or premature loss of patent protection) could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. regulatory compliance failures could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers and prescribers, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including lilly, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal and state governmental authorities and private payors and consumers. these claims could result in substantial expense to the company. in particular, see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters , for the discussions of the u.s. sales and marketing practices investigations. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the cgmp issues. see item 1, business regulation of our operations , for more details. we face many product liability claims today, and future claims will be largely self-insured. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily zyprexa, des, and thimerosal, and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for other products in the future. see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters and item 3, legal proceedings , for more information on our current product liability litigation. we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market, and therefore will be largely self-insured for future product liability losses. in addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. manufacturing difficulties could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties can result in product shortages, leading to lost sales. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. we face other risks to our business and operating results. our business is subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including: economic factors over which we have no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and overall economic conditions in volatile areas can affect our results of operations. changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and foreign tax audits, can affect our net income. changes in accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board, the securities and exchange commission, and the emerging issues task force can affect reported results. 13 table of contents our results can also be affected by internal factors, such as changes in business strategies and the impact of restructurings, asset impairments, technology acquisition and disposition transactions, and business combinations. cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements we have made certain forward-looking statements in this form 10-k, and company spokespeople may make such statements in the future based on then-current expectations of management. where possible, we try to identify

process after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in recent years, fda review times have increased substantially and fewer new drugs are being approved. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict sales growth rates of new products. we face intense competition. we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and generic pharmaceutical companies. to compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. our product sales can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic versions of our branded products, and by generic versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. see item 1, business competition, for more details. our long-term success depends on intellectual property protection . our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover, develop, and commercialize innovative new pharmaceutical products. without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support the enormous investments in research and development and capital as well as other expenditures required to bring new drugs to the market. intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. in the u.s., the hatch-waxman act provides generic companies powerful incentives to seek to invalidate our patents; as a result, we expect that our u.s. patents on major products will be routinely challenged, and there can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property protection, for more details. we are increasingly facing generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s. as well. in addition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. if successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property protection, for more details. 11 we depend on patent-protected products for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings, and we will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of them in the next several years. eight significant products, which together comprised 74 percent of our worldwide revenue in 2010, have lost or will lose their most significant remaining u.s. patent protection and data-based exclusivity, as well as their intellectual property-based exclusivity in most countries outside the u.s., in the next several years: product worldwide revenues (2010) percent of total 2010 revenues loss of relevant u.s. exclusivity zyprexa $5.03 billion 22 october 2011 cymbalta $3.46 billion 15 2013 alimta $2.21 billion 10 2017 (compound patent plus data-based pediatric exclusivity); 2022 (concomitant nutritional supplement use) humalog $2.05 billion 9 2013 cialis $1.70 billion 7 2017 gemzar $1.15 billion 5 november 2010 (compound); 2013 (use) 1 evista $1.02 billion 4 2014 strattera $576.7 million 2 2016 1 1 the gemzar use patent has been held invalid by the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit, and we are seeking review of that decision by the u.s. supreme court. the strattera patent has been held invalid by a u.s. district court, and we have appealed that decision; in the meantime, an injunction prevents the launch of generic forms of strattera. for more information, see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters. loss of exclusivity, whether by expiration or as a consequence of litigation, typically results in a rapid and severe decline in sales. see item 1, business patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property protection, for more details. our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other health care cost containment measures. government health care cost-containment measures can significantly affect our sales and profitability. in many countries outside the united states, government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which our products are sold. in the united states, we are subject to substantial pricing pressures from state medicaid programs and private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, including those operating under the medicare part d pharmaceutical benefit, and implementation of the recently-enacted u.s. health care reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures. in addition, many state legislative proposals would further negatively affect our pricing and/or reimbursement for our products. we expect pricing pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the united states to become more severe. see item i, business regulations affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, for more details. pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns. unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as costly product liability claims. regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company. the marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive regulation. many companies, including lilly, have been subject to claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, private payers and consumers. these claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. it is possible other products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. in particular, see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters, for the discussions of the u.s. sales and marketing practices investigations. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) regulations for pharmaceutical products can lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, and delays in the approvals of new products pending resolution of the cgmp issues. we are now operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the u.s. department of health and human services that requires us to maintain comprehensive compliance programs governing our research, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of pharmaceuticals. a material failure to comply with the agreement could result in severe sanctions to the company. see item 1, business regulation of our operations, for more details. 12 we face many product liability claims today, and future claims will be largely self-insured. we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims involving primarily byetta, zyprexa, diethylstilbestrol (des), and thimerosal, and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the future. see item 7, management discussion and analysis legal and regulatory matters, and item 3, legal proceedings, for more information on our current product liability litigation. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to be largely self-insured for future product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products. in addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. manufacturing difficulties could lead to product supply problems. pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted facilities, or the failure or refusal of a contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, could result in product shortages, leading to lost sales. see item 1, business raw materials and product supply, for more details. a prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our business and operating results. while pharmaceuticals have not generally been sensitive to overall economic cycles, a prolonged economic downturn coupled with rising unemployment (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population) could lead to decreased utilization of drugs, affecting our sales volume. declining tax revenues attributable to the downturn are increasing the pressure on governments to reduce health care spending, leading to increasing government efforts to control drug prices and utilization. in addition, a prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our investment portfolio, which could lead to the recognition of losses on our corporate investments and increased benefit expense related to our pension obligations. also, if our customers, suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. we face other risks to our business and operating results. our business is subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including: economic factors over which we have no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, can affect our results of operations. changes in tax laws, including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings or investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state, and foreign tax audits, can affect our results of operations. in its budget submission to congress in february 2010, the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the u.s. would tax the international income of u.s.-based companies. some provisions changing taxation of international income were enacted in august 2010, which did not have a material effect on results of operations. while it is uncertain how the u.s. congress may address u.s. tax policy matters in the future, reform of u.s. taxation, including taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of discussion for the u.s. congress and the administration. a significant change to the u.s. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. changes in accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission can affect our financial statements. our financial statements can also be affected by internal factors, such as changes in business strategies and the impact of restructurings, asset impairments, technology acquisition and disposition transactions, and business combinations. we undertake no duty to update forward-looking statements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk you can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( e.g., interest rate risk) in item 7 at management discussion and analysis financial condition. that information is incorporated in this report by reference. 33risk factors; cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. it is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. 11 we make certain forward-looking statements in this form 10-k, and company spokespersons may make such statements in the future. where possible, we try to identify forward-looking statements by using such words as expect, plan, will, estimate, forecast, project, believe, and anticipate . forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. they are likely to address our growth strategy, sales of current and anticipated products, financial results, our research and development programs, the status of product approvals, legislative and regulatory developments, and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations. all forward-looking statements are based on our expectations at the time we make them. they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those summarized below. pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain. there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development

efforts to control drug prices and utilization. additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay in a timely manner for our products that they purchase. we have experienced delays in repayment from national health care systems in certain countries, including but not limited to regions within spain and italy. the ongoing euro area financial crisis has heightened our sensitivity to such trends, and we continue to monitor the countries and regions creditworthiness. a prolonged economic downturn could also adversely affect our investment portfolio, which could lead to the recognition of losses on our corporate investments and increased benefit expense related to our pension obligations. also, if our customers, suppliers or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. we rely to a large extent on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure. the size and complexity of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. likewise, confidentiality or data privacy breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that trade secrets, personal information, or other sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons 13 or to the public. while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. we
